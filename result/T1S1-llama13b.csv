The sentence C describes a contrast between the person's self-perception of their guitar skills and their actual performance, which is similar to the contrast between John's wealth and his loneliness. The other sentences do not convey a similar contrast."

The most analogous sentence is option B, which also expresses a contrast between someone's expectations and the reality of the situation.

B. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the contrast between the appearance of something (the life of a celebrity) and the reality of it (the problems they face).

Option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it describes a physical entity (Lake Erie) that appears one way (draining into Lake Ontario) but has a different reality (the Niagara River is the path it takes).

The other options do not share this same structure of contrasting appearance and reality:

Option A describes a person (Kevin) who appears to be skilled but is actually not as talented as expected.

Option C is a general statement about the importance of experiencing the journey, rather than just the destination.

Option D is a statement about preferring to use an old item (a pan) over a new one with more features, but does not have the same contrast of appearance and reality as the target sentence."

The most analogous sentence is C, which is comparing a drawing to a book, with the implied comparison being that the drawing provides a more concise and comprehensive view of the subject matter than the book. Just as the neighbor's home is more attractive than the speaker's own home, the drawing provides a more attractive and comprehensive view of the subject matter than the book."

The correct answer is A. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb"" is a metaphorical sentence that describes a person calming down after being angry. The sentence ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"" is also a metaphorical sentence that describes the start of a long journey. Both sentences use metaphors to convey a message, and both have a similar structure and tone. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:

Sentence B describes the need to carefully examine something, rather than skimming through it quickly, which is an appropriate analogy for the target sentence. Sentences A, C, and D do not convey a similar meaning or context."

Explanation:

Sentence B is the most analogous because it describes someone who has different social groups for different activities, implying that they enjoy different things and may take breaks or rest after engaging in each activity. Sentences A, C, and D do not convey the same idea of enjoyment and rest."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes Ally's state of being sick and resting. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes someone else's state of being in a similar situation. Sentence B describes the speaker's love for talking to people about computers, which is an activity that is not related to the target sentence. Therefore, it is the most analogous sentence.

Option A is not analogous because it describes someone's reputation and not their current state. Option C is not analogous because it describes someone's past behavior and not their current state. Option D is not analogous because it describes someone's future plans and not their current state."

Both sentences convey a preference for a more practical option over a more luxurious one."

D. They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.",A,"
B. Although she realized the mistake a week after the incident, she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.

Explanation:

The target sentence is comparing two different states of being, where the cake is hot now but will not be hot later. Similarly, in option B, the speaker realized the mistake a week after the incident but waited two years before apologizing, comparing two different states of being (realizing the mistake and not realizing it).

Option A is not analogous because it is comparing the current weather to a different time, whereas the target sentence is comparing the current state of the cake to a different state.

Option C is not analogous because it is describing a person's emotional state, whereas the target sentence is describing the physical state of the cake.

Option D is not analogous because it is describing a person's family situation, whereas the target sentence is describing the physical state of the cake."

D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"B. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens. The speaker is expected to be cold, but they are not. The speaker is expected to walk, but they choose to drive instead. The most analogous sentence is B, where the speaker's skills are expected to be poor, but their actual performance shows their hard work."

D. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.",A,"
The correct answer is B. Everyone thought that he would lose, but he made a comeback through herculean effort.

Explanation:
The target sentence is advising the listener not to be too demanding or greedy, as excessive negotiation might lead to the offer being withdrawn. Similarly, option B is the most analogous sentence, as it describes someone making a comeback after being thought of as a loser, much like how the listener should not be too greedy and risk losing the offer. The other options do not share the same theme of cautioning against excessive demands or risking loss."
42,"Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.","A. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.

The correct answer is (B) No need to take so much work this quarter, as performance won't impact appraisals. Work more in the next two quarters when the management will actively prioritize it.

The target sentence is about bringing a map even though the speaker is familiar with the woods, just in case they get lost. Similarly, option (B) is about doing less work this quarter because the performance won't impact appraisals, but working more in the next two quarters when the management will prioritize it. Both sentences are about being prepared for the future and taking precautions, even if they may not be necessary at the moment."

Explanation:
All the options are analogous to the target sentence in the sense that they are all providing a piece of advice or a precautionary measure.

The correct answer is C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a metaphorical expression that means that if you start something, you should see it through to the end. The sentence ""In for a penny, in for a pound"" is a common idiom that means that if you have committed to something, you should be prepared to go all the way. The sentence ""we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished"" emphasizes the importance of completing the task.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also uses a metaphorical expression to convey a message. The sentence ""The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry"" uses the metaphor of food to convey the idea that if you are in charge of something, you should see it through to the end. Just like the target sentence, option C uses a metaphor to emphasize the importance of completing the task.

Option A is not analogous because it does not use a metaphorical expression. Option B is not analogous because it does not convey the same message as the target sentence. Option D is not analogous because it does not use a metaphorical expression and the context is different."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the poker player's satisfaction with the hand he was dealt and his continued investment until he lost all his money.

The correct answer is D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Explanation:
All the options are analogous to the target sentence in the sense that they describe someone's determination and effort towards achieving a goal, but option D is the most similar in terms of the language used and the context. Just like the target sentence, option D uses the phrase ""no matter how difficult it is"" to convey the idea that the person is determined to achieve their goal despite the challenges they may face. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""put in each and every ounce of energy"" emphasizes the effort and dedication that the person is putting into their training, which is similar to the idea of cooking a Thanksgiving dinner from scratch."

Explanation:

D. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.",D,"
The correct answer is D. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.

Explanation:
The target sentence is advising the reader to take action (go to the garage) to avoid a potential problem (car malfunctioning). The analogous sentence should also be advising the reader to take action to avoid a potential problem.

Option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it is also advising the reader to take action (submit the courses early) to avoid a potential problem (not getting a seat).

The other options do not have the same structure as the target sentence. Option A is not advising the reader to take action, but rather describing a situation where the reader is at risk of receiving bad reviews. Option B is not related to the target sentence at all. Option C is also not related to the target sentence, and the phrase ""seems to attract"" is not present in the target sentence."

C. The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.
D. We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!.",D,"B. The director finally completed the film, having done everything in his power to get the film released and bankrupting his production company.

Explanation:
All of the options are analogous to the target sentence in that they describe a situation where taking action to address a small issue could prevent a bigger problem from arising.

Option A is similar in that the speaker is taking precautions to avoid getting lost during a hike, which could lead to bigger problems if not addressed.

Option C is similar in that the students' actions caused a mess, which could lead to bigger problems if not addressed.

Option D is similar in that the speaker is suggesting taking action early to avoid missing out on the best deals, which could lead to bigger problems if not addressed.

Therefore, option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence, as it describes a situation where taking action to address a small issue (completing the film) could prevent a bigger problem (bankrupting the production company) from arising."

The correct answer is C. Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.

Explanation:
The target sentence is discussing a hypothetical situation where someone arrived late and missed an opportunity to fix a malfunction. The most analogous sentence is C, which is also discussing a situation where someone arrives at a specific time and misses an opportunity (in this case, avoiding a crowd). The other sentences do not share the same context or logical connection as the target sentence."

B. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.
C. To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.
D. You can't pour from an empty cup.",A,"
The correct answer is B. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.

Explanation:

The target sentence expresses regret for not taking action earlier, which could have led to a better outcome. Similarly, in option B, the painter had to use an unconventional color (red) due to the absence of the intended color (yellow), resulting in an unexpected but famous outcome. This analogy highlights the idea that unforeseen circumstances can lead to unexpected outcomes, just like the painter's unconventional choice led to a famous painting."

The correct answer is B. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.

Explanation:

The target sentence expresses regret for not taking action earlier and the consequences that have arisen as a result. The most analogous sentence is B, which also expresses regret for not taking action earlier (going to the farmer's market early) and the potential consequences of not doing so (the remaining options may not be as favorable).

The other options do not convey the same sense of regret and missed opportunity as the target sentence and the most analogous sentence. Option A is unrelated to the target sentence and does not convey regret. Option C is also unrelated and expresses a desire for something that has already happened (the TV show not ending) rather than a missed opportunity. Option D is a statement of envy rather than regret."

The correct answer is C. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.

Explanation:

The target sentence is advising the reader to take immediate action to avoid a negative consequence (traffic).

Just as beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, the quality of someone's work ethic can be perceived differently by different people."

The other sentences do not share the same theme of considering multiple options, and are therefore less analogous."

The correct answer is C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the reason why Mary stopped talking to Amy, which is because of the way Amy spoke to her. Similarly, the sentence C describes the reason why the speaker cannot learn from the book, which is because of the peculiar grammar and word choice. Both sentences focus on the negative impact of the way something is done. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Lester barely made it into the dance team by a small margin, just before the audition was about to close. Similarly, in option D, Peter managed to escape from the secret police, but only just barely, and it was a close call. Both sentences convey a sense of narrowly avoiding a negative outcome."

The correct answer is C. In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.

Explanation:

The target sentence describes a situation where someone managed to achieve something difficult despite the odds being against them. The most analogous sentence is C, which also describes a situation where someone is determined to complete a task despite the challenges they face. The phrase ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" suggests that the speaker is committed to seeing the task through to the end, even if it means staying up all night. The other options do not convey the same sense of determination and perseverance."

Explanation:

All the options are analogous to the target sentence in the sense that they describe a situation where something negative or difficult is averted or overcome just in time.

Option A is the most analogous because it describes a situation where someone is saved just in time, much like the group managed to finish the project just in time.

Option B is not as analogous because it describes a positive outcome (passing an exam) rather than a negative outcome being averted.

Option C is not as analogous because it describes a situation where a team is trying to win a title, rather than avert a negative outcome.

Option D is not as analogous because it describes a situation where someone collapsed after a physical activity, rather than avert a negative outcome."

B. Walter failed his exam, but his father only responded, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk,"" when he arrived.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes someone making a narrow margin, and the most analogous sentence is B, which describes someone failing an exam but their parent only responding with a phrase that means ""don't worry about it."" Both sentences describe a narrow margin or a close call."

C. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

The correct answer is B. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the opponent in the game as ""just as good"" and ""close to victory,"" indicating that they were a formidable opponent. Similarly, in option B, the speaker was only given an ""old, rusty"" bicycle as an option, indicating that it was not their first choice."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that many people lack commitment when it comes to losing weight, and the sentence ""The presentation was such a mess!"" expresses the idea that a lot of information was attempted to be conveyed in a short amount of time, resulting in a lack of clarity. Both sentences convey the idea that attempting to do too much in a short amount of time can lead to a lack of success or clarity.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes someone who is afraid of doing something but wants to build up the courage to do it. The most analogous sentence is option B, which describes someone who will experience negative consequences if they don't take a certain action (in this case, going to sleep early). Just like the target sentence, option B describes a situation where someone wants to take a certain action but is held back by fear or hesitation."

Explanation:

The correct answer is A. Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes Sally's hesitation to start something new (going to the gym) due to her fear, but she has recently shown interest and expressed her intention to start soon. Similarly, in option A, Frank has never tried to write a computer program before due to his fear of computers, but he has recently expressed his intention to start.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a comparison of the baby's position to that of a bug in a rug. The most analogous sentence is option B, which also compares the dog's position to that of someone else (Sally's father). The other options do not contain a similar comparison."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes Jimmy's feeling of reassurance after consulting with the professor.

The correct answer is:

B. Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.

Explanation:

The target sentence describes Frank's experience of finally having a good sleep in his childhood bed after returning home from years of working abroad. Similarly, option B describes a situation where someone (politicians) is used to doing something (telling lies) that is not beneficial to them, but they continue to do it anyway. Just like Frank's experience of finally having a good sleep, the politicians could improve their situation by changing their behavior (being sincere about their aims).

The other options do not share the same analogy as the target sentence:

A is about someone choosing not to focus on a problem (being underpaid), which is not the same as the target sentence's focus on the comfort of being back in one's childhood bed.

C is about someone (Jimmy) feeling reassured after consulting with someone else (a professor), which is not related to the target sentence's theme of familiarity and comfort.

D is a proverbial phrase that is not related to the target sentence's theme of comfort and familiarity."

Correct answer is B. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.

Explanation:

Option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also involves a person being called to talk about their actions or behavior (in this case, a serial killer being called on national television to talk about their crimes). The other options do not share this similarity with the target sentence."

D. The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.",D,"C. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Explanation:
All of the options are analogous to the target sentence in that they describe someone becoming so focused on a specific task or detail that they lose sight of the bigger picture or overall context.

Option A is similar in that the speaker is so focused on finishing the assignment that they don't notice the impact of their partner's absence.

Option B is similar in that the speaker is so focused on making do with the cold weather that they don't consider the possibility of waiting for better conditions.

Option D is similar in that the congressman is so focused on the wording of his bill that he doesn't realize its overall feasibility.

However, option C is the most analogous to the target sentence because the speaker is so focused on preparing for the final race that they put all of their energy into the training, without considering the bigger picture or overall context."

The target sentence describes someone choosing to tolerate or ""get along with"" someone they know is not a good friend, despite having the ability to reject them. This is similar to the situation in option B, where the professor knows the students mostly copied the homework but decides not to be strict about it.

Option A is not analogous as it describes someone being lonely due to their wealth, rather than tolerating someone for their own gain. Option C is not analogous as it describes a preference for familiar items over new ones, rather than tolerating someone for their own gain. Option D is not analogous as it describes someone doing something they shouldn't do, rather than tolerating someone for their own gain."

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"
The correct answer is C. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where the professor knows the students have copied their homework but chooses not to enforce the rules strictly. Similarly, in option C, Linda's demeanor changes when her husband is around, and she feels she can be her true self. Both sentences convey the idea of someone being aware of a situation but choosing not to take action or enforce the rules."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes Lisa's decision not to mention Mark's actions to him, despite knowing that he borrowed her book without asking. The most analogous sentence is D, as it describes a situation where someone manages to hold on to something (in this case, the rock) despite a potentially dangerous situation (falling off a cliff). Similarly, Lisa is choosing not to mention Mark's actions to him, despite knowing that he borrowed her book without asking."

The correct answer is B. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.

Explanation:
The target sentence highlights the idea that actions speak louder than words. The given sentence with the correct answer, B, also conveys a similar idea. The speaker's daughter creates problems for her mother if she has nothing else to do, indicating that idle hands can lead to trouble. This is analogous to the target sentence, where the speaker's grades speak louder than her words about not bragging about them."

The correct answer is B. You can't drive a car with no fuel.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where something (the friendship) appears to be one way (strong and active on social media) but is actually another way (weak and inactive in reality). The most analogous sentence is B, which describes a situation where something (a car) appears to be functional (able to drive) but is actually not functional (has no fuel)."

The correct answer is B. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.

Explanation:
The target sentence is describing a contrast between Garry's words (he managed the work stress easily) and his actions (he smokes constantly). The most analogous sentence is B, as it describes a contrast between the parents' words (they were not good parents) and their actions (they were always ready to spend quality time with their children). Just like Garry's words and actions, the parents' words and actions are in conflict."
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.

Explanation:

All of the options are analogous to the target sentence in that they are all imperative sentences that use ""keep"" to indicate ongoing action.

D. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.",D,"
The correct answer is B. He attacked every point in my argument.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where many students come to study under a guru. Similarly, in option B, He attacked every point in my argument, the word ""attacked"" suggests a situation where someone is confronting or challenging a particular point or argument. Both the target sentence and option B describe situations where someone is taking action against or confronting something. Therefore, option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
270,"John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.","A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the process of bringing out dishes and the resulting gathering of guests. Similarly, option B describes the process of opening window blinds and the resulting brightening of the room. Both sentences have a cause-and-effect structure, with the cause (bringing out dishes or opening blinds) leading to the effect (gathering of guests or brightening of the room). Therefore, option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

The correct answer is D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the growth of a suburban community outside the city center, which is similar to the development of a clean and proper floor. Both involve a transformation or growth of something that was previously in disarray or not well-maintained. The analogy is based on the idea of improvement or enhancement, which is the common thread between the two."

D. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.",D,"
The correct answer is B. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.

Explanation:

The target sentence is a metaphorical comparison of blades of grass to bayonets, implying a threatening and dangerous situation. The most analogous sentence is option B, which also uses a metaphor (getting bored and tired with the same old job) to describe a situation where someone leaves their current situation and starts something new (opening a restaurant). The other options do not use metaphors or comparisons in the same way, and do not convey the same sense of danger and change as the target sentence."

D. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.",B,"
The correct answer is B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""He attacked every point in my argument"" is a metaphorical sentence that uses the word ""attack"" to describe someone refuting or criticizing another person's argument. The most analogous sentence to this target sentence is B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer, as both sentences use the word ""attack"" to describe a physical action that is used to describe a metaphorical concept. The other options do not use the word ""attack"" in the same way, and do not convey the same metaphorical meaning as the target sentence."

Explanation:

The correct answer is B. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes someone's ideas being challenged as they read books, and the most analogous sentence is one that also involves a challenge or obstacle related to writing or reading. Sentence B is the most analogous because it implies that one cannot write with an inkless pen, which is a challenge or obstacle related to writing. Sentences A, C, and D do not have this same connection to writing or reading, and are therefore less analogous to the target sentence."
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"A. Lets meet him and ask about the robbery. Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""It's hard to love with a broken heart"" is a sentence that expresses a difficult or challenging situation. The most analogous sentence to this is option B, which also describes a situation where someone is aware of something difficult or challenging (Lisa knowing that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but not mentioning it to him). The other options do not share this similarity and are therefore less analogous."

C. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"D. one can't eat from a broken plate.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""You can't pour from an empty cup"" is a metaphorical statement that one cannot receive or accomplish something if they do not have the necessary resources or abilities. The most analogous sentence to this target sentence is ""one can't eat from a broken plate"" because it also uses a metaphor to convey the idea that one cannot receive or consume something if the vessel or tool used to do so is broken or inadequate. The other options do not use metaphors in the same way and do not convey the same idea as the target sentence."

B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.
D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"
The correct answer is B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a negative statement about the absence of light from an unlit candle. The most analogous sentence is option B, which is also a negative statement about the absence of something (a house) and the need to accept a less desirable alternative (sharing). The other options do not have the same negative tone or focus on the absence of something."
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"A. He attacked every point in my argument.

C. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",B,"B. It's hard to love with a broken heart.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a metaphorical statement that compares the act of writing with having ink in a pen.

Just as you need ink in a pen to write, you need a whole heart to love."
290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",B,"B. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
All the options are analogous to the target sentence in the sense that they convey the idea that something cannot be done without a necessary resource or component.

Option A is not the most analogous because the comparison is not as direct as the other options. While the drawing may show something at a glance, it is not a necessary resource for understanding the subject matter, unlike fuel for driving a car.

Option C is also not the most analogous because the sentence does not convey a sense of necessity or requirement. The subject danced off their sugar high and fell asleep, but there is no implication that they needed to do so.

Option D is the least analogous because it is a completely different scenario and does not relate to the idea of a necessary resource. Opening a YouTube channel does not require any specific resource or component, unlike driving a car which requires fuel.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option B: You can't write from an inkless pen."

B. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""one can't eat from a broken plate"" is a metaphorical statement that means one cannot benefit from something that is broken or not functioning properly. The most analogous sentence to this target sentence is option B, ""I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone."" This sentence is analogous because it also uses a metaphorical statement to convey the idea that one is afraid to do something, but will eventually do it once they gain confidence or independence. The other options do not convey the same metaphorical meaning as the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the parent's attempt to impart knowledge to their child through simple communication. The most analogous sentence is B, which describes the flow of water from a larger container to a smaller one through a narrow pipe. Just as the parent is trying to convey knowledge to their child, the water is flowing from a larger container to a smaller one. The other options do not have a similar relationship between the two clauses."

Explanation:
The target sentence is discussing the federal government's spending package, which is a contentious issue.

Option C is the most analogous sentence, as it describes a situation where a contentious war has been resolved and the countries are now maintaining friendly relations."

D. In familiy planning, it's wise not to trust just one childcare method. Different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.",B,"
B. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.

Explanation:
The target sentence is describing how something (in this case, coffee expenses) is draining away resources (income). The most analogous sentence is B, which describes how Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario, as both sentences are describing the flow of something from one place to another. The other options do not have a similar relationship between the two clauses."

Explanation:

Option C: The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence among the options is C, which also presents a past counterfactual situation with a conditional clause (Even though I lost everything in the fire) and a main clause (I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery)."

Answer:

D. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence as it expresses a similar idea: a seemingly negative situation (missing a party, missing a plane) ultimately leading to a positive outcome (avoiding trouble, meeting a new person). Both sentences use a conditional clause (if + past tense) to describe the negative situation and emphasize the positive result."

Answer: C

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where an artist had to use an unconventional choice of color due to the unavailability of the desired color, which ultimately made the painting famous.

In the target sentence, the speaker had to finish the entire assignment on their own because their project partner got sick.

Both sentences emphasize the unusual nature of the situation and the extra effort required to complete the tasks at hand."

The target sentence talks about using a pen for gossip and rumors, while the analogous sentence talks about Sally relaxing when she should be working. Both sentences highlight a contrast between what someone is doing and what they should be doing, making option B the most analogous."

D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it presents a situation where someone (Sally) does something (relaxing) based on someone else's example (her sister), but it turns out to be the wrong choice because they have other responsibilities (work to do). In the analogous sentence, the person (your friend) does something (goes to the spa) based on someone else's example (your friend), but it doesn't mean that the other person (you) can do the same thing too, as they also have responsibilities (homework)."

Answer: B

Explanation:
Sentence B is the most analogous to the target sentence because it also contains an individual who is adhering to a specific set of rules or beliefs (religious beliefs) despite their inflexible nature. This is similar to the president in the target sentence who has to step down according to the rules of the constitution. The other options do not share this theme of adhering to rules or constraints."

Answer: C

Explanation:
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option C.

Option C: John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences describe an event that unfolds gradually and reaches a conclusion without the subject's full awareness. In the target sentence, the person finishes the meal without realizing it, and in option C, the guests gather around the table as the dishes are brought out. The progression of events in both sentences is similar, making option C the most analogous choice."

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.

D. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.",D,"
B. Since both of our favourite teams have lost, let's enjoy the world cup together and not fight.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence as it expresses a situation where one should be grateful for what they have, given the circumstances. In the target sentence, the focus is on being thankful for the sunshine in summer because it is brief during winter. Similarly, in option B, the idea is to enjoy the World Cup together and not fight, even though both favorite teams have lost. This encourages finding the positive aspects in a situation that may not be ideal."

D. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.",A,"
Answer: B

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where someone has no homework to do and spends the weekend coming up with ways to annoy their brother. Sentence B is the most analogous because it also involves someone who has no pressing tasks to complete (an important surgery the next day) and thus asks the staff not to interrupt him with minor tasks. Both sentences share the idea of someone having free time due to a lack of immediate responsibilities and using that time for other purposes."

Answer:

B. Kim checked the papers in a rush so that she can have more free time. But, now she needs to redo them as half of the class complained.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence because it shares a similar structure and theme. Both sentences describe a person taking an action (Ron coming up with detailed and complex pranks, and Kim checking papers in a rush) because they have no responsibilities or constraints (Ron is not given any responsibilities towards anything, and Kim wants to have more free time). However, both actions lead to negative consequences (Ron's pranks causing trouble, and Kim needing to redo the papers due to complaints)."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences describe a situation where someone (Ron in this case) engages in disruptive behavior (creating detailed and complex pranks) when there is no authority figure (responsibilities) to monitor or control their actions, similar to how the students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor."

Answer: B

Explanation:
The target sentence emphasizes the importance of addressing a problem promptly to avoid more serious consequences later on. The most analogous sentence among the options is B: ""Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment."" This sentence also highlights the importance of taking timely action to achieve a goal, as procrastination or lack of commitment can hinder progress."

Answer:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it expresses a similar idea: taking action early to avoid potential problems or to achieve a better outcome. In the target sentence, resolving small issues in relationships immediately prevents bigger troubles down the road. In sentence D, going early to the boutique on the day of their sale ensures getting the best stuff, which is similar to the concept of addressing small issues before they become bigger problems."

0,All that glitters is not gold.,"Once upon a time, in the busy city of New York, a young man named Jack lived a life of simple contentment. Jack was a small town lad, who had moved to the bustling city in pursuit of his dreams. He had always aspired to be a successful businessman, undeterred by the amount of hard work and dedication it would require.

One day, he walked past a bustling storefront, its window glittering with a display of shiny trinkets. Among them was an ornate golden watch, its lustrous appeal drawing Jack towards it. Being an ambitious man, Jack thought that possessing the golden watch would give him an essence of opulence and success. Ignoring his meager savings, he walked into the shop and purchased the beautiful timepiece.

Days turned into weeks, and Jack flaited the golden watch proudly. He noticed that people around him, including his colleagues, looked at him with a certain level of respect and admiration. He was convinced that the watch was the magical talisman bringing him all the recognition.

However, the unforeseen soon occurred. One afternoon, as Jack was winding his watch, it suddenly stopped. He furrowed his brows, shook the timepiece, and even tried to wind it again, but to no avail. Jack took the watch to a nearby watch repair shop. There, he was met with some shocking news.

The craftsman examined the watch closely, removed his magnifying glasses, and sighed heavily. The glittering watch was not made of gold; it was a mere imitation. It was worthless and unrepairable. Jack was taken aback, the harsh truth felt like a cold shower, washing away the illusion of opulence he had built around himself.

He returned home, his pride wounded and heart heavy. He pondered over his foolishness, his decision to invest his savings on something that seemed grand but held no real value. He had been swept away by the glitter, the superficial charm of a material object, and the hollow respect it gained him.

From this bitter experience, Jack learned a vital lesson. The saying ""All that glitters is not gold"" made perfect sense to him now. He realized that appearances could be deceptive, and mere materialistic possessions do not define success or respect.

The incident left Jack more mature, wiser, and more focused on his path. He decided not to get distracted by materialistic illusions anymore. Instead, he would invest his time and effort in nurturing his skills, growing as a businessman, and building authentic relationships based on respect and shared values rather than ostentatious appearances.

This invaluable lesson that Jack learned that day stayed with him throughout his life, shaping his decisions and guiding him in his path towards real success. He finally understood that all that glitters is indeed not gold. It is the person we are and the values we uphold that truly glitter and carry a golden worth.","150,146,247,287,254,10,80,243,300,268,120,14,78,291,203,119,186,104,171,47,124,48,274,310,205,122,295,60,285,52,127,230,216,15,105,7,111,4,57,313,239,277,331,113,309,320,234,253,227,212,110,63,17,24,161,184,126,188,288,240,262,307,187,306,90,322,276,199,45,16,75,201,3,273,18,258,270,11,139,256,134,145,53,44,196,158,82,170,279,317,59,266,193,328,165,38,6,34,157,27,223,178,293,297,259,98,56,303,137,109,286,255,290,9,121,46,250,332,207,308,167,222,103,213,20,61,97,129,19,54,66,36,123,79,215,206,289,151,30,242,143,12,128,1,5,62,327,93,211,265,130,25,198,8,140,252,37,181,251,138,330,58,229,163,87,81,182,204,31,166,281,142,210,153,156,272,64,269,217,283,176,245,221,85,141,116,2,136,160,180,35,296,315,13,155,99,40,249,275,282","144,187,73,38,145,97,36,154,114,6,78,142,194,12,34,70,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
1,The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks.,"Once upon a time in a small town lived a young woman, Emma, with an insatiable curiosity about the lives of the royals. The grandeur of the castles, shimmering crowns, lavish feasts, and endless ceremonies intrigued her, painting a picture of glamour and fun in her mind. She would often remark, ""Oh, how I wish I could trade my boring life with theirs!""

One day, fate played its part and Emma was magically transformed into a princess. Delighted, she relished in the splendor of her new life. She bathed in milk and honey, dressed in silk gowns and jewels, and attended grand ceremonies. From afar, Emma's life seemed like a dream come true, a fairy tale brought to life.

However, as time passed, the glamour started to fade. She realized her every move was observed, every word measured, every action scrutinized. She felt like she was living in a gilded cage, pretty to look at but bound and confined. Privacy was a luxury she had traded off for her royal status. Her heart longed for the simplicity and freedom she had once enjoyed.

She yearned for days when she could walk through the meadows, without guards trailing behind her, or have an honest conversation without the fear of a scandal. Tucking into her bed alone at night, in the enormous palace, she realized she was lonelier than ever. The endless protocol and duties, the fake smiles she had to put on at every public event, the immense pressure to always look perfect and composed; it was all overwhelming.

One day, she was informed of a grand ball being organized in her honor. The castle was filled with chatter, laughs, and music, but Emma felt a strange solitude amidst the crowd. As she danced with dukes and diplomats, she dreamt of the tiny cottage in her hometown, her simple bed, her friends, and her freedom.

Suddenly, she felt a lump in her throat. She excused herself, fleeing the ballroom in tears. She ran to her royal chambers, locked the door, and finally allowed herself to break down. She had never felt more isolated and trapped.

Emma now understood that the life of royals, though looks glamorous from afar, was not as happy and fun as it seemed. The luxurious life came with a hefty price - her freedom, her privacy, and her happiness. It was a beautiful illusion that hid the ugly truth beneath its golden veils.

In the end, Emma learned a valuable lesson. She realized that true happiness lies not in glittering crowns and grand palaces, but in freedom and love. Although it took a hard lesson, she was content knowing that her humble life, away from the royal glamour, was more fulfilling and joyful. And from then on, she never yearned for the life of royals again, understanding it was not as carefree and delightful as it had seemed from afar.","168,199,323,105,3,260,181,223,289,24,150,138,217,288,147,134,166,5,222,137,141,66,144,242,110,159,322,136,87,154,125,290,339,165,47,13,203,273,128,228,158,57,27,38,41,90,246,12,332,280,214,11,220,67,188,263,10,279,172,270,225,268,29,139,149,48,56,145,113,78,191,129,338,71,127,327,86,294,193,318,321,55,211,51,205,167,0,153,320,277,103,256,15,132,218,299,298,37,2,304,104,9,231,6,177,187,248,324,84,312,210,115,102,233,89,8,293,143,250,21,45,309,61,313,130,201,123,80,42,60,243,334,64,208,98,36,35,40,234,209,14,274,30,59,34,240,112,216,7,65,16,77,81,237,185,25,333,301,176,151,282,4,99,135,230,79,311,22,253,31,17,155,116,317,212,337,63,249,163,186,196,52,257,314,275,39,152,111,183,259,169,239,291,224,106,238,284,264,28,265","87,99,5,162,18,104,149,116,102,57,52,48,36,141,93,151,171","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
2,"The journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like.","Stephen Hammond, a seasoned journalist for the prestigious New York Times, had always held an intrigue towards the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. One particular actress who had always caught his eye was Lila Day, a prodigious actress whose life seemed more than extraordinary from the outside. Her talent was immeasurable and her fame, incalculable. It seemed she possessed everything anyone could ever wish for.

In the lavish parties he had attended, Lila was always the center of attention, surrounded by a throng of admirers. Her laughter could be heard echoing in the gilded halls, her smile brightening up every photograph she graced. On the surface, her life seemed like a whirlwind of dazzling lights, champagne, and applause. This apparent spectacle of grandeur lured Stephen into believing Lila led an extraordinary life.

Seeking to uncover the secrets of this alluring world, Stephen decided to pen a feature on Lila Day, to reveal the life of a superstar to the world. He embarked on his journey, filled with anticipation for unearthing exciting truths. As a journalist, he was prepared to uncover the facts beneath the glamour and the glitz.

Days turned into weeks as he followed Lila, interviewing her closest confidantes, attending her parties, and even spending a day on the set of her latest movie. He was mesmerized by her captivating on-screen presence and her ability to sway an audience.

However, the more he delved into Lila's life, the more he started seeing the cracks in the glamourous facade. Away from the flashbulbs, Lila's life was marred with a sadness that was hard to ignore. The constant scrutiny and the relentless pressure to remain on top were taking their toll on her.

He noticed that she was often alone, even in rooms filled with people. The ever-present smile seemed strained at times, the laughter didn't quite reach her eyes, and there was a perpetual exhaustion that hung about her. Lila was always under the public's watchful gaze, unable to relax or have any moment of solitude. Her life seemed to be filled with unending obligations and commitments.

As Stephen discovered more about her, he began to comprehend that being a famous actress was not just about the glamorous parties and adulation. There were sacrifices, compromises, and immense stress accompanying the fame and success.

His assumptions about Lila's extraordinary life shattered as he realized how tough it was to always be in the spotlight. Lila's life was a far cry from what it looked like on the outside. It was a life lived under constant pressure to perform and please.

In the end, Stephen wrote a piece not about a glamorous superstar, but about a human being with dreams, struggles, and vulnerabilities. His understanding of Lila's life brought depth to his work, turning it into a heartfelt exploration of the cost of fame. Stephen had thought the life of Lila Day was extraordinary, but he later realized it was not quite what it looked like.","121,233,85,322,232,76,309,289,28,303,143,150,61,14,78,83,179,159,20,218,290,331,140,80,138,235,161,202,147,225,100,166,223,132,329,269,120,49,93,32,209,127,262,35,193,186,109,327,213,30,124,258,101,66,139,102,163,190,279,87,220,73,38,177,208,4,249,58,146,181,9,129,259,51,191,323,7,300,130,13,144,69,50,194,65,97,17,0,68,187,157,230,288,160,23,252,196,231,281,203,216,335,37,45,277,204,10,268,250,168,71,60,33,292,207,3,111,302,195,267,254,212,293,8,171,224,88,240,131,52,119,320,324,67,247,110,270,158,206,246,286,316,174,295,305,296,257,184,314,70,170,333,11,86,242,12,72,336,6,330,106,31,266,135,142,185,306,265,1,198,113,241,22,108,307,312,222,34,148,188,189,228,334,162,321,5,248,315,84,19,287,16,234,116,95,133,275,141,274,15","88,169,116,66,186,159,77,124,71,107,153,156,80,14,200,192,87","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
3,The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.,"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Manhattan, there was a charismatic individual named Howard who claimed to be a successful CEO. He was eloquent, always immaculately dressed, and seemed to possess an enchanting aura that drew people towards him. Known by all as an astute businessman, Howard gained a reputation for being a successful entrepreneur. Unaware of the darker facets of his persona, companies of all sizes flocked to collaborate with him.

Among them was GreenTech, a small but promising technology startup. GreenTech was working on a revolutionary green technology that had the potential to change the world. However, they were desperately in need of an investor. Their hope was to find someone with the power to catapult them onto the global stage.

One day, the CEO of GreenTech, Jeffrey, was introduced to Howard at a business conference. Howard expressed interest in the company’s groundbreaking invention and showed an eagerness to invest. His seemingly sincere interest in their vision and the prospects he promised was very convincing.

Jeffery, utterly smitten by Howard's charisma and apparent business acumen, was quick to trust him. He was excited by the prospect of their business finally getting the boost it needed to break into the mainstream. To him, Howard seemed to be the ideal investor, not just for the capital but for the vast network he appeared to offer. The promise of this lucrative deal excited Jeffrey and the rest of the team at GreenTech.

Unfortunately, the decision to do business with Howard turned out to be a grave mistake. It all started when the promised investment never arrived, and Howard became elusive when asked about it. His enchanting persona began to fade, replaced by a shifty, unreliable character. 

Their trust was shattered when they discovered Howard was not a legitimate CEO. Instead, he was a con artist who made a living by preying on hopeful startups. What once appeared to be promising business proposals, turned out to be nothing but empty words crafted to dupe the unsuspecting. 

The charming so-called CEO, Howard, later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. The promises he made to Jeffery and the rest of the GreenTech team were nothing but a mirage, a cruel illusion of success.

In the end, the ordeal left GreenTech in a tough spot, but they also learned a crucial lesson. They learned the importance of thoroughly scrutinizing potential investors, no matter how charming or successful they might seem. They vowed to move forward, armed with this new-found wisdom, and continue their pursuit to change the world with their green technology.","155,41,81,206,202,30,308,115,235,208,88,330,188,223,239,322,263,15,205,189,35,218,69,238,215,9,100,89,162,287,267,19,98,4,12,166,26,160,161,23,117,328,118,99,338,59,198,171,321,284,335,279,316,170,67,331,78,334,183,55,194,249,104,320,16,105,140,74,259,255,190,269,323,38,203,317,241,28,319,2,111,112,56,77,210,79,339,184,270,246,134,156,278,336,106,17,296,96,151,114,280,24,300,212,49,251,302,146,200,122,230,258,87,237,11,226,292,91,277,132,268,39,182,8,227,286,312,176,324,76,179,124,281,315,173,14,201,289,10,283,306,243,85,46,197,224,310,13,135,80,32,157,97,66,288,7,142,158,329,1,282,337,265,34,93,131,276,304,5,149,318,51,86,204,178,271,6,326,94,303,290,68,121,214,0,127,295,107,233,95,291,169,22,25,191,293,229,245,36,307","185,160,80,34,169,177,156,124,26,139,115,35,148,136,18,65,96","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
4,Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.,"At the local soccer academy, there was a name that echoed through the training grounds, hallways, and conversations. The name was Kevin, an icon who had elevated to a god-like status among the new recruits. To them, he was infallible, unbeatable, and undeniably the best player in the game. Their blind admiration was based on a single moment - a famous goal he had scored last season. It was a breath-taking, unbelievable strike that had catapulted Kevin to instant stardom.

Kevin, however, remained elusive for the new batch, their only acquaintance with him being through his legendary tales. So, they worshipped him, waiting for the day they would meet their soccer messiah. The day arrived when the academy organized a special scrimmage game, presenting the opportunity for the newcomers to play with the senior students, the superstar Kevin included.

As they lined up in the academy's giant soccer field, their nerves tingled with excitement and anxiety. There he was, Kevin, in all his glory, displaying the confidence of a seasoned player. The game began and Kevin's supporters watched him with eager eyes, anticipating the magic they had heard so much about. Yet, as the game progressed, the magic seemed lacking.

Kevin was undoubtedly good but did not seem invincible. He seemed human after all. His passes weren’t always accurate, his shots weren't flawless, and he even missed a straightforward goal. The recruits watched in disbelief as their idol proved to be mortal. The famous goal that had secured Kevin's place in their hearts and minds seemed to be just a lucky strike.

When the game ended, the recruits were left in a whirl of confusion and disappointment. They had built Kevin to be a superhuman player, yet the reality was vastly different. The question was, had they set him on an unrealistically high pedestal?

Later, Kevin, unaware of the disillusionment his performance had caused, approached the dejected newbies. He spoke to them about the famous goal, explaining how it was not skill but pure chance that had made it successful. He said he too was surprised when the ball had found the back of the net.

""I'm not a superstar,"" he added, laughing, ""I just had a lucky day.""

In those words, they found a new respect for Kevin. He was not the unbeatable soccer god they had initially thought, but that did not make him any less admirable. Kevin was human, had his strengths and flaws, and despite all, he had still accomplished something they could only dream of. Their worship of Kevin did not diminish, rather it became more realistic and understanding.","38,260,64,137,155,185,128,329,2,324,112,309,32,91,270,264,327,293,94,167,12,198,178,119,256,98,79,168,202,160,238,143,76,275,125,205,97,55,127,122,62,3,86,292,276,70,33,133,100,226,305,58,15,177,40,9,104,7,335,173,336,271,95,8,201,13,107,210,37,273,161,332,166,331,152,134,77,44,233,239,61,328,26,279,281,75,192,142,193,49,82,151,66,163,101,244,229,297,16,153,314,319,88,257,225,90,284,111,0,164,237,14,302,175,146,182,156,87,69,269,5,147,28,219,109,247,282,188,240,321,48,129,135,34,72,65,157,80,298,181,131,224,78,39,199,67,114,171,10,288,11,148,1,263,213,299,123,272,121,103,325,50,232,23,180,255,41,261,106,320,83,36,93,183,186,194,132,6,311,52,24,17,139,189,301,74,73,207,315,286,211,56,206,84,116,307,235,126,313,231","109,153,9,42,121,178,58,64,56,149,151,21,66,112,53,99,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
5,Mary often boasted of her rose garden to be the best garden in the city. But in reality it is nothing but ordinary.,"Mary was a proud lady who lived in the heart of the bustling city. She was particularly fond of her rose garden, which she cherished like a valuable treasure. Nearly every day, Mary would boast about the wonder and grandeur of her rose garden, claiming it to be the best in the entire city. She would invite friends, neighbors, and sometimes even strangers to come and admire her exquisite collection of roses.

Her garden was indeed pretty, filled with a colorful assortment of roses, but it was certainly nothing extraordinary. The roses were typical varieties, the types that could be found in any other garden in the city. Yet, Mary's enthusiasm about her garden was infectious, and many people were drawn in by her vibrant claims.

Mary was known for throwing lavish parties, where the highlight was a tour of her precious rose garden. She would stride around, her chest puffed up with pride, pointing out the different types of roses she had cultivated. ""This here,"" she would say, ""is the rarest and most expensive rose in the city,"" pointing to an ordinary red rose.

One day, a man from the city’s gardening association happened to pass by Mary’s house. Intrigued by the rumors of this magnificent rose garden, he decided to pay a visit. Mary, with her ever-beaming smile, welcomed him and proudly led him to her garden, boasting of each rose like they were her children.

As the man walked around, he noted that while Mary’s garden was indeed beautiful, it was not exceptional. The roses were just regular species, nothing rare or unique, and there were several other gardens in the city that were far more impressive. However, he chose not to burst Mary's bubble and appreciated her garden with polite enthusiasm.

Months passed and Mary continued to boast about her garden, convincing even the skeptics with her unwavering confidence. She saw her garden not as it was, but through a lens of love and pride, which made her garden the most beautiful in her eyes.

Every day, Mary woke up early to nurture her garden, taking care of each plant as if it were her own child. Her dedication was undeniable, and even though her garden was ordinary by all means, it was the best garden in the city to her.

Regardless of the reality, Mary's rose garden was her sanctuary, her paradise. It was there where she felt happiest, tending to her ordinary roses. To her, each petal, each leaf was a marvel. And in that respect, maybe her rose garden was indeed the best garden in the city. After all, the beauty of a garden isn’t just in its plants, but also in the love and care bestowed upon them.","242,203,254,246,268,44,229,232,153,20,121,142,309,91,101,208,312,284,19,187,73,234,337,125,108,182,237,1,197,63,264,231,35,256,148,93,165,171,53,225,122,94,198,100,253,155,83,188,159,240,296,161,215,110,241,0,136,267,124,61,48,269,26,137,191,65,150,115,46,29,80,43,8,330,14,13,336,7,11,162,300,3,18,69,270,249,227,105,239,172,333,24,138,169,173,168,299,116,9,128,79,34,52,167,194,206,86,102,207,319,6,40,21,279,49,163,133,147,175,15,67,218,257,62,95,89,306,301,78,209,39,228,205,224,68,17,41,72,158,259,252,271,332,2,329,204,178,261,202,235,31,42,71,201,294,149,276,74,130,126,134,103,251,310,10,255,4,119,176,12,92,181,107,180,56,54,289,291,295,75,38,154,131,33,334,308,104,16,127,193,135,57,106,84,66,109,262,316,144,97","56,28,144,82,167,111,78,73,99,165,79,170,76,75,120,188,136","1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
6,Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.,"Once upon a time in the bustling city of New York lived a young man named, Jason. He was a tall, muscular, and handsome man, but always walked with a scowl on his face. People often misjudged him, thinking of him as arrogant and snobbish. His stern looks and beefed-up physique were deceiving, they made everyone believe he was a bitter person.

Jason, however, was more than what met the eye. Within that rough exterior was a heart that held immeasurable kindness. Jason was a hardworking man who spent his weekdays working in a busy construction firm. But his weekends were devoted to volunteering at a homeless shelter, where he cooked meals and taught basic literacy to the less fortunate.

One cold winter's day, Jason saw a shivering homeless girl, Lucy, huddled in a corner of the street. She was dirty and her clothes were in tatters. Everyone around, frightened by her appearance, scuttled past her as if she was a plague. But Jason wasn't one to judge people based on appearances alone; he knew that appearances could be deceptive.

Instead, he approached the scared little girl, covered her with his warm coat, and gently coaxed her to come with him to the shelter. He then cleaned her up, fed her a warm meal and offered her a safe place to stay. When Lucy looked into his eyes, she did not see a frightening muscular man, she saw a kind soul reaching out to her.

Word soon spread around town about Jason's good deeds. People began to see him in a new light and realized they had wrongly judged him. This shift in perception served as a lesson for everyone in town: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.

As for Lucy, she started to flourish under Jason's care. She learned to read and write, grew strong and healthy, and went on to become a social worker to help others like her. She, too, remembered the lesson she had learned from Jason and taught others the same.

She shared her story with everyone she met, emphasizing the importance of not judging people based on their appearances. After all, a scruffy homeless girl had turned into a compassionate social worker and a brooding, muscular man was one of the kindest souls she had ever met.

The townspeople, moved by Lucy's story and the transformation they saw in her, began to reevaluate their biases and judgment. As for Jason, he continued his humble life, always reminding people that the outer shell doesn't reflect what's inside the heart.

In the end, the town learned a valuable life lesson. They stopped judging people based on their appearances, knowing well that appearances can often be deceptive. And so, they lived more consciously, embracing this newfound wisdom, spreading love and acceptance throughout their little city.","183,77,214,145,38,13,287,53,66,190,256,93,148,219,44,288,94,47,188,330,307,119,225,187,266,5,49,74,142,122,92,26,177,106,220,334,209,123,108,294,161,240,63,196,297,140,300,101,25,11,246,133,238,223,10,88,272,34,310,184,3,295,83,70,275,285,259,135,129,151,314,299,328,100,113,305,61,165,243,197,332,167,159,241,337,163,131,302,217,23,324,210,298,186,35,331,121,116,164,52,222,102,72,284,174,321,120,204,40,303,308,153,4,138,16,291,229,32,57,55,62,254,2,292,141,312,14,1,178,253,233,7,200,289,112,152,237,198,201,281,180,327,111,316,0,333,317,104,134,248,157,270,279,258,87,150,41,276,323,29,162,329,191,221,149,69,336,27,91,45,127,273,144,274,160,12,242,304,95,227,37,17,228,171,8,75,203,296,60,98,309,86,315,206,9,15,236,65,226,147","145,128,123,61,113,26,132,185,195,55,50,176,6,127,196,115,182","1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 160, 163, 166, 169, 172, 175, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193, 196, 199"
7,"Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire.","Although he may appear as an ordinary man, don't let his clothes fool you. He isn't one to wear flashy designer clothes or adorn himself with the latest accessories. You won't see him draped in Gucci, nor would you find him in Louis Vuitton. His outfits, while always clean and neat, are decidedly simple, often lacking even a brand logo. The reality, however, is far removed from what his clothes might suggest. Despite his unsophisticated attire, he is actually a millionaire.

His name is John, and he's made a fortune in the tech industry. He is the owner of a successful start-up that revolutionized the world of communication. But, surprisingly, his lifestyle and preferences aren't what you'd expect from a self-made millionaire. He resided not in an extravagant mansion with gilded gates and marbled floors, but in a modest bungalow nestled among towering trees and chirping birds.

His living room didn't boast a grand piano or exquisite antique collections. Instead, it contained comfortable couches and shelves bursting with an array of books, from classic literature to the latest scientific journals. He drove a modest car, preferring its efficiency and practicality over the showy luxury models many of his peers favored.

He didn't frequent high-end restaurants and chic coffee shops. Rather, he enjoyed homemade meals and sipping coffee at his favorite local café. He preferred silence and serenity over the noise and chaos of swanky parties. In his eyes, the glitz and glamour of the millionaire's lifestyle were mere distractions from the simple pleasures of life.

At first glance, he may look like the guy-next-door, but his inconspicuous appearance is a stark contrast to his massive wealth. He purposely keeps himself underdressed. For him, his unpretentious appearance keeps him grounded, reminding him of his humble beginnings.

However, this frugal facade doesn't indicate a lack of generosity. He is the silent benefactor of numerous charities and scholarship programs. He invested heavily in the education sector, contributing to the construction of schools and libraries. He sponsored countless students, who otherwise would never have had the chance to afford quality education.

All this philanthropy, carried out discreetly and without seeking any recognition, sets him apart. He is a millionaire not defined by the thickness of his wallet, but by the breadth of his actions. So, don't be fooled by his clothes, for beneath the humble fabric, beats the heart of a true philanthropist, a man richer in character than in currency.","93,139,59,189,212,274,29,336,261,264,286,174,201,322,3,134,232,230,110,200,334,273,275,214,184,271,187,132,238,312,135,217,4,226,229,117,308,316,306,156,52,128,81,281,159,98,67,37,0,49,24,68,151,154,18,221,115,119,89,90,84,220,15,193,183,112,250,25,58,56,162,277,235,79,291,9,141,65,32,317,30,241,71,288,247,124,92,222,106,2,329,262,5,337,88,231,63,10,165,309,259,6,8,42,252,14,292,181,310,219,295,177,258,12,75,17,36,74,169,173,338,66,331,204,48,296,16,197,39,236,168,27,191,251,198,46,266,279,72,327,182,223,294,263,155,35,270,209,210,166,100,23,293,103,153,171,243,45,1,176,224,285,303,91,34,13,22,233,228,170,332,108,300,167,44,299,127,240,62,280,145,207,130,114,196,237,276,333,245,11,133,218,192,131,253,301,248,328,150,96","49,159,90,15,33,93,102,103,76,98,190,114,166,106,63,127,116","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
8,"Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.","Lexi had an appearance that was deceiving. At first glance, she may seem like an airhead, with her bubble gum pink hair, clothes that could only be described as eccentric, and her constant giggle that never seemed to end. It was all too easy to dismiss her, categorize her under ""dumb blonde"", and move on. And that is precisely what most people did.

But as I got to know Lexi, I began to realize how superficial that perception was. Despite her seemingly shallow exterior, she proved to be one of the wisest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She showed depth in her thoughts and words that were nothing short of profound. 

I remember one time when a group of our friends were discussing their relationship issues. One of our friends, Kate, was having difficulty deciding whether to break up with her boyfriend. Most of our friends opted for the usual platitudes, encouraging Kate to follow her heart.

Then Lexi spoke up. At first, there was a lull in the conversation as everyone turned to look at her. I think, in part, they were curious about what advice Lexi, with her glittery pink eye-shadow and bubblegum-scented lip-gloss, could possibly offer.

Without any hesitation, Lexi said, ""Fear of being alone should never be the foundation of a relationship."" She followed it up by explaining that it was far more important to find happiness within oneself before seeking it in another.

There was a stunned silence as everyone absorbed Lexi's words. I remember Kate's eyes glistening with unshed tears, moved by Lexi's wisdom. From that day forward, no one underestimated Lexi again. Not when she spoke about personal growth, not when she offered her views on world politics, and certainly not when she solved an algebra equation faster than anyone in class.

From then on, whenever I saw Lexi in her technicolor outfits, giggling at her own jokes, I saw more than an airhead. I saw a young woman wise beyond her years, bravely defying societal stereotypes. I found myself constantly admiring Lexi, not just for her wisdom but also for her courage to be herself.

All in all, Lexi taught me an invaluable lesson about appearances and judgments. Despite her flamboyant exterior, she held a wisdom that was rare and beautiful. Although Lexi looked like an airhead, she was one of the wisest people I had ever met, and I was proud to call her my friend.","1,34,19,147,58,36,22,177,276,210,207,227,301,144,23,142,165,270,154,12,9,161,86,332,296,31,261,208,88,29,218,90,167,251,159,220,196,279,50,257,201,247,285,94,43,108,78,57,306,236,260,175,135,305,198,101,151,320,64,120,82,173,309,242,245,292,2,217,229,282,233,143,316,92,300,274,11,15,61,178,297,182,74,113,286,164,67,268,267,134,105,107,335,166,118,0,222,89,32,26,66,54,17,98,27,331,333,91,265,6,275,238,137,244,63,117,271,184,46,115,232,21,223,273,4,339,72,7,249,317,302,33,191,185,287,183,338,215,109,141,322,170,253,310,104,145,230,293,171,180,122,315,307,3,131,235,44,334,250,136,119,181,14,239,246,129,259,216,277,62,116,41,252,65,290,324,148,266,150,149,24,311,188,199,84,5,226,52,10,42,194,204,13,18,337,168,16,200,112,291","96,1,67,154,125,186,110,128,21,189,77,20,193,163,78,197,103","1, 4, 10, 11, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 28, 32, 36, 38, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 54, 55, 57, 58, 61, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
9,"Claire always thought that Max was unkind and rude because of his edgy fashion sense. But once she learned how kind and sensitive he was, she was surprised.","Claire had always been a modest and conventional dresser, she was that kind of woman who wore neutrals to blend in, hardly ever noticed at first glance. Max, on the other hand, was like a comet in the evening sky, impossible to ignore. His edgy fashion sense was loud and pronounced, a stark contrast to her muted pastels and earth tones.

Max would stride into their shared office every morning wearing a different flashy ensemble that ranged from rock star chic to unconventional bohemian. He had an array of studded leather jackets, pants with chain accessories, and a collection of boots that reached halfway up his shins. His dark hair was perpetually slicked back and his face always adorned with rings of kohl around his sapphire-blue eyes.

To Claire, the fashion choices Max made signified an unkind and rude demeanor. She couldn't see how someone who put so much effort into looking intimidating and standoffish could be kind or approachable. So she kept her distance, preferring to observe him from afar, inadvertently increasing her impression of Max as a heartless and cocky character.

But fate had other plans in store for Claire. A huge project at work paired them together, forcing her to work side-by-side with Max. Initially apprehensive, she steeled herself for what she was sure would be an onerous ordeal.

Max, on the contrary, proved to be a wonderful collaborator. He was kind, patient, and incredibly helpful. Beneath the layers of leather and metal accessories, he held a surprising amount of sensitivity and empathy. He listened intently when Claire spoke, his eyes reflecting a level of respect and understanding that she had never expected.

Max not only proved himself to be a gentle soul but also remarkably generous. He was always the first one to help anyone in need, often volunteering his time and skills to help their colleagues. His kindness and sensitivity were beyond any exterior aesthetics, and this surprised Claire, leaving her feeling guilty for her earlier misconceptions.

As their project progressed, Claire found herself warming up to Max, appreciating his unique style and admiring his kindness. In his company, she discovered a new depth to him, one that debunked all her prior assumptions and stereotypes. She now understood that appearances can indeed be deceptive and a person's sense of fashion doesn't necessarily reflect their character.

It was a humbling realization for Claire. She felt a strange twinge of affection for the man she had once dismissed as unkind and rude. Max's edgy fashion sense no longer represented his personality to her. Instead, she now saw him as an individual who was as compassionate and gentle as he was fiercely unique.","118,180,117,141,7,172,62,145,8,55,63,267,185,39,311,155,336,281,41,312,227,187,61,236,264,87,29,338,125,231,286,261,303,104,66,48,329,335,297,128,106,120,100,115,131,238,47,253,190,228,248,171,146,64,173,119,212,302,13,42,101,176,19,270,252,331,229,206,1,135,157,313,256,28,121,45,318,158,219,72,259,179,191,6,198,225,2,310,88,327,15,181,243,159,332,263,299,197,71,188,254,147,91,317,226,93,245,244,77,130,12,218,142,276,322,217,53,79,330,192,26,177,230,78,216,24,43,11,113,321,258,325,152,94,86,250,67,134,32,308,289,280,3,273,282,200,316,288,38,114,183,239,51,167,105,328,52,211,186,255,102,203,278,240,294,221,14,298,144,279,199,269,70,20,23,220,68,84,56,76,10,182,283,275,293,214,22,251,33,17,5,16,124,83,0,4,304,82,260,319","195,69,87,143,196,191,84,5,9,181,128,111,59,167,91,192,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
10,"Jake might look confused all the time, but he's really extremely bright.","Jake may always have that perplexed expression on his face, but that's just a facade. Anyone who takes the time to know him is usually quite surprised to discover that he is really extremely bright. He simply doesn't feel the need to always make that fact known.

Jake moved through life with a constant furrowed brow, a slightly crinkled forehead, and a perpetually puzzled look. His squinting eyes gazed out from beneath those bushy brows, appearing to be eternally questioning the world around him. The corner of his mouth had a slight, permanent twist, as if he was perpetually trying to solve some invisible puzzle.

At school, his teachers initially mistook his expression for a lack of understanding. They would often explain concepts and theories multiple times, assuming that Jake just wasn't grasping the subject matter. All the while, his classmates would snigger and make fun of his constant 'confused' demeanor.

But those who spent time with Jake knew better. His best friend, Sam, understood that beneath that bewildered exterior lay an intelligent and quick mind. He would often catch Jake solving complex calculus problems with remarkable ease, and his knowledge of world history was vast and impressive. It was as though Jake was perpetually hungry for knowledge, an intellectual who was always curious about the world.

During debates, he would always come up with arguments that left even the most talkative students speechless. His arguments were always logical, and his points were delivered with a conciseness that was undeniably convincing. 

Despite his peculiar demeanor, the school eventually learned of Jake's extraordinary intellect. His results in academic competitions and stellar grades were simply undeniable. Yet, Jake never bragged about his achievements. He remained humble, acknowledging his victories with a subtle nod, and the same puzzled look on his face.

Soon, he earned the respect of his teachers and fellow students. The sneers and giggles from the back of the class transformed into awe-filled whispers. Everyone began to understand that Jake's apparent confusion wasn't a sign of ignorance, but a mark of his quest for more knowledge and understanding.

In time, they realized that behind that facade of confusion was a mind that shined brighter than anyone else's in the school. Jake's unending thirst for knowledge made him an inspiration to others, encouraging them to strive for academic excellence regardless of how they might appear.

The story of Jake serves as a reminder that appearance can be deceptive. Just because someone looks confused all the time, it doesn't mean that they are. As for Jake, he remained the same: a supposedly 'confused' young man, with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a mind brighter than anyone could guess.","309,114,199,153,170,167,76,9,107,28,279,158,19,206,159,176,284,85,11,13,335,34,328,102,57,226,207,337,163,290,72,123,301,40,139,238,20,101,280,144,115,12,186,108,202,219,103,0,7,16,137,93,214,173,55,172,25,194,136,188,84,86,254,4,221,119,133,183,3,198,131,18,201,252,288,138,211,14,100,1,48,89,242,157,189,74,324,135,63,245,109,161,286,175,33,277,217,129,278,185,257,315,17,132,45,98,275,258,266,261,15,291,225,30,150,260,112,310,224,5,92,27,220,216,169,38,97,52,8,124,154,329,187,237,246,61,191,297,249,128,240,2,283,81,241,47,152,294,82,182,22,281,267,251,209,320,184,197,6,304,178,23,247,215,31,165,174,264,164,134,181,292,319,299,192,156,296,227,327,316,179,73,285,313,166,322,270,62,35,91,336,268,56,145,111,234,95,273,203,289","48,80,142,69,64,120,159,49,129,8,19,42,20,78,111,50,103","1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107, 110, 113, 116, 119, 122, 125, 128, 131, 134, 137, 140, 143, 146, 149, 152, 155, 158, 161, 164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, 182, 185, 188, 191, 194, 197, 200"
11,"Don't trust everything on the social media. It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.","Once upon a time in a town called Sanford, lived a teenage girl named Jenny. She was a high-spirited girl, full of life, but was often found engrossed in her smartphone. She was infatuated with the world of social media; an enticing platform that revealed a multitude of lifestyles she yearned to emulate. 

She marveled at the fun-filled pictures of her friends and celebrities, seemingly always having the time of their lives. Posh parties, exotic vacations, perfect relationships, and endless laughter were the usual feed on her social media accounts. Everyone seemed to be living a fairy tale life that she only dreamed of. It left her feeling like she was missing out, that her life wasn't as exciting or glamorous.

One day, her mother noticed Jenny's constant state of discontent. ""Don't trust everything on the social media, Jenny,"" her mother warned her. ""It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.""

Jenny didn't heed her mother's advice. She thought her mother couldn't understand the young generation's lifestyle. She continued scrolling through her social media feeds, yearning for a life filled with endless adventure and joy.

One day, her school announced a grand reunion party. Jenny was excited as she knew this was her chance to experience the glamorous life she witnessed on social media daily. She prepared for days, fantasizing about the fun she would have, which she would then share on her profiles.

Finally, the day arrived. The party venue was embellished beautifully, and her friends arrived in designer clothes, looking like they stepped out of a magazine. Everyone was busy capturing moments on their smartphones rather than actually living them. Jenny, too, did the same. She danced, clicked pictures, laughed, but all for the camera.

At the end of the night, as she scrolled through her phone, the pictures painted a colorful portrait of happiness and enjoyment. But when she reflected on the actual experience, she realized she hadn't really enjoyed herself. She had been too concerned with capturing the 'perfect' moments for her social media.

This was the moment of revelation for her. She understood what her mother meant by saying, ""Don't trust everything on the social media."" Jenny realized that people often portrayed a picture-perfect life on social media, but it wasn't necessarily the reality. 

From that day forward, Jenny started taking her mother's advice more seriously. She still used social media, but she didn't let it dictate her happiness or shape her perception of reality. She understood that the key to happiness was not in comparing her life with others but in appreciating her own.","59,24,15,252,222,92,316,156,310,195,9,12,35,251,268,10,64,314,302,306,36,122,27,182,249,178,129,58,294,202,19,30,333,320,54,55,326,18,134,97,236,193,265,165,48,173,205,203,50,96,3,285,240,75,280,33,239,153,2,125,196,77,290,275,78,80,4,126,106,210,336,131,14,170,213,247,208,81,149,43,21,118,272,245,46,25,330,194,151,76,180,13,112,260,223,141,49,1,172,329,303,135,34,109,105,159,132,167,218,144,166,204,57,175,38,246,181,29,312,284,51,95,0,8,300,315,293,20,121,22,279,319,200,138,104,176,174,148,274,304,119,127,161,163,209,82,147,56,6,124,157,140,39,286,283,281,5,91,226,207,23,288,307,152,94,235,116,164,328,233,323,219,120,234,201,297,162,72,42,113,45,324,237,289,7,111,17,313,188,250,130,16,99,295,334,321,325,68,335,74","123,98,59,51,67,157,149,185,124,11,16,12,92,73,3,192,187","1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
12,"Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.","Working in a busy corporate office, pushing papers day in and day out, I couldn't help but sometimes ponder about the choices I had made in my life. Was I satisfied? Yes. But did a nagging sense of wanting more, a larger perspective of life, gnaw at me? Absolutely.

I looked across the room towards you. You, my best friend since high school, wore the aura of someone who had seemingly found a deeper sense of contentment. Your desk cluttered with papers, a warm cup of coffee in your hand and the faint hint of a smile playing on your lips while you continued working on your laptop.

You'd always been more academically inclined. I remembered how, post-college, you made a decision to further your education by pursuing your master’s degree. I, on the other hand, lured by the thought of a steady paycheck and the allure of the ""real world"", had opted to step right into the workforce.

""You look pensive,"" you commented, your eyes never leaving the screen.

""Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job,"" I confessed, the words slipping out before I could contain them.

You looked up at me, surprise painted on your face. ""Why would you say that?"" you asked, pushing back your chair and giving me your full attention.

""Well,"" I began, taking a sip of my cold coffee. ""I see you with your degrees and I see your sense of accomplishment. It just seems so...satisfying. The gratification of having learnt something new, something more.""

A chuckle escaped your lips as you shook your head in amusement, ""I see you, my friend, with your job, and I sometimes think I should have done that. I could've started earning earlier, gained professional experience.""

A warm smile spread across my face as you continued, ""I mean, it is exciting to learn and explore in academia, but sometimes the real world seems more enticing, doesn't it?""

I chuckled, realizing the irony of our situation. Isn't it interesting how human beings always crave what they don't have? The grass does seem greener on the other side until we get there and see the reality.

We laughed heartily, understanding each other perfectly. Isn't this the beauty of friendships? They hold a mirror to our thoughts, make us realize our fallacies, and add a dash of humor to our overthinking.

Nodding at your insightful words, I added, ""Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.""

We clinked our coffee cups, a toast to our different paths and perspectives, a celebration of our individual decisions, acknowledging that both paths have their own value and no choice is inherently wrong or right. It's all about what each of us wants from our life. Life continued in the office, and we went back to our own worlds, a bit wiser, a lot more content.","97,185,84,286,101,85,102,68,243,150,215,273,157,226,92,334,14,41,313,171,200,317,263,288,29,242,182,32,290,70,65,339,272,19,322,287,43,218,163,267,198,162,271,53,46,274,67,121,155,55,116,320,130,307,326,232,123,30,5,194,77,80,47,275,237,195,27,199,173,140,15,240,4,187,8,78,222,151,83,281,295,257,289,111,227,224,17,329,66,205,244,170,239,183,39,1,148,59,139,284,225,314,37,115,21,228,76,135,3,48,113,22,303,204,117,293,179,231,236,276,51,217,160,96,119,20,7,234,11,316,69,219,306,90,94,38,0,18,73,71,296,99,324,10,305,6,264,180,280,103,152,337,44,315,247,221,34,153,137,75,61,40,202,149,159,9,304,265,241,161,256,253,255,134,141,201,318,16,249,56,88,144,81,186,109,209,52,106,176,169,167,207,2,114,214,269,60,297,13,156","137,96,193,109,73,59,146,127,75,166,144,129,199,17,71,178,87","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
13,The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.,"Jonathan Chambers was a reputed lawyer, well-regarded in his field. He was highly sought after by numerous top-tier law firms and had even been offered a partnership at his firm. Yet, he was not content with his profession. With each case he dealt with, he found himself disillusioned with the law. He had begun to notice the shadows lingering in the hallways of justice.

Thus, an idea began to form in Jonathan's mind, an idea that was as dangerous as it was compelling. He started to contemplate the idea of leaving the legal profession behind and pursuing an MBA. The business world beckoned him with the allure of a different kind of challenge. He thought of the strategic decisions, the operational changes, the careful handling of resources, and the thrill of leading a business to success. This idea consumed him, overshadowing his formidable legal career.

Despite the objections from his family and friends, he applied for a sabbatical from his firm and began preparing for his entry into a top-tier business school. Countless nights of intensive study followed, culminating in his admission into one of the most renowned universities in the country. He left his legal career behind, to be locked away like an old suitcase in the attic, not to be thought of again.

Two years flew by in a flurry of assignments, presentations, and internships. Jonathan loved the hustle of business school. He enjoyed the challenge it presented and relished every moment. Soon, he stood proudly on the podium, holding his MBA degree high for the world to see. His journey had been arduous, but he believed it was worth it. With a new lease on life, he stepped down from the podium, a graduate, ready to conquer the world of business.

However, life often has a way of serving humble pie. Despite his MBA, Jonathan found himself struggling in the job market. Unlike his legal career, where job offers came knocking at his door, his journey as an MBA graduate was devoid of such privileges. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and still, he was unable to find a suitable job. His name, once a symbol of legal prowess, seemed to carry no weight in this new realm.

Although he remained optimistic at first, cracks began to appear in Jonathan's self-assured demeanor. The rejections began to weigh heavily on him. Despite his stellar academic record and impressive personality, he found himself unable to secure a position.

His decision to transition from a lawyer to an MBA graduate, which once seemed a brilliant idea, now seemed like a miscalculation. However, Jonathan refused to admit defeat. He continued his search, hoping for a breakthrough that would validate his shift in profession and appease the gnawing regret in his heart. He had thought that an MBA was the answer to his discontentment, but the reality was far from what he had imagined. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.","10,195,153,99,33,58,21,161,87,234,136,260,223,155,286,18,273,17,138,165,318,230,299,110,275,40,188,36,180,292,277,11,169,8,296,338,135,77,45,210,124,172,337,246,294,152,154,145,167,68,330,222,47,117,52,89,142,35,324,206,15,113,133,291,225,106,191,70,119,76,129,46,56,108,157,200,176,216,123,95,78,5,132,158,50,233,44,101,198,333,16,130,69,7,6,80,240,229,313,170,28,319,221,290,209,1,29,105,258,265,285,94,332,215,73,164,100,303,42,114,203,256,322,317,204,323,0,190,307,72,268,289,276,90,315,121,197,32,302,326,14,267,91,177,310,61,12,264,293,4,306,278,308,263,283,199,131,41,107,279,134,328,194,217,83,75,243,48,156,282,125,3,232,245,227,271,214,202,192,329,116,9,127,120,231,186,309,2,184,331,213,300,74,173,274,65,82,149,93,97","127,106,188,172,150,82,95,94,34,182,1,32,147,141,61,91,18","1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200"
14,John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.,"John had been born into a well-to-do family, inheriting a fortune so large that it was often incomprehensible even to him. He owned luxurious penthouses in cities renowned for their exuberance and affluent life. The company he inherited from his father was a multi-billion-dollar business empire, earning him the title of a billionaire. John, it seemed, was an epitome of prosperity and success. And while many looked at his life with a tinge of green in their eyes, everyone envied his wealth.

John's life was extravagant, filled with parties, fast cars, and the finest of wines. His dinners consisted of the rarest delicacies catered by celebrity chefs, and his holidays were in the most sought-after tourist destinations. His days were filled with business, while his nights were filled with entertaining high-profile guests. John was living the proverbial dream, or so it seemed to those looking from the outside.

Despite such a luxurious life and seemingly endless wealth, he yearned for something else. Every time he looked at his reflection in the gold-framed mirror, he couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. John was surrounded by people, by admirers, by business partners, but he felt utterly alone.

Unlike most, John's problems didn't revolve around money; instead, they revolved around the gaping void in his life, void that his wealth couldn't fill. He had no true friends, no family, and no one who genuinely cared for him beyond his fortunes. He had no one to share his victories with, no one to lean on during his failures. His riches were a magnet that attracted the people around him, but his heart yearned for a connection that was more human and less materialistic.

As the sun set behind his luxury yacht, he stood there, a solitary figure amidst a sea of opulence. He had everything that money could buy, but he yearned for that which money couldn't afford - companionship, genuine relationships, and true love. He realized that despite being one of the richest men in the world, he felt poor. Poor in affection, poor in companionship, poor in all the aspects that made life worth living.

John's wealth was a blessing and a curse. It attracted envy, but also isolation. He was rich beyond measure, but was a destitute in matters of the heart. He was living a life many could only dream of, yet his heart was crying out in solitude. John was a man surrounded by people, yet he was utterly alone.","281,265,114,318,313,220,116,7,56,271,44,50,13,84,131,9,295,324,282,197,314,153,87,102,156,259,210,53,16,237,77,138,151,110,10,127,228,155,290,181,227,213,101,291,302,46,120,172,122,137,150,143,89,216,55,135,199,251,8,299,194,132,303,164,3,187,105,159,284,67,306,106,296,133,32,193,20,66,297,316,35,5,142,64,24,169,80,104,305,33,128,246,54,300,173,217,12,72,276,113,301,74,160,94,205,146,115,124,165,17,226,75,336,141,99,22,163,147,190,49,242,63,338,328,0,288,90,47,325,174,315,71,206,60,154,182,91,57,86,112,39,2,270,175,267,78,109,245,83,58,70,207,249,144,11,108,304,15,48,4,21,168,1,262,233,327,98,96,186,261,241,326,321,234,258,62,167,121,253,269,40,294,6,192,322,100,59,334,130,264,161,311,229,285,19,231,224,30,320,27","125,163,142,65,160,82,183,8,59,16,35,155,97,13,158,29,110","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
15,It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.,"Trisha gazed out from the window of her apartment, soaking in the vibrant nightlife of Tokyo. The street was buzzing with life, bright neon signs glittering on the facades of buildings, people bustling about, laughing and living life to the fullest. ""It looks like fun,"" she murmured to herself.

Yes, the new environment was exciting and thrilling. Each corner boasted unique shops, each alleyway teemed with secrets waiting to be discovered. It was like being a part of a dynamic, pulsating organism, forever evolving and adapting.

But beneath this awe and wonder, she felt the pressure, the stress, and the undeniable struggle. She missed her home in London, the comfort of familiarity, the warmth of loved ones. She craved for a simple cup of tea at her favorite café, yearned to hear the chime of Big Ben, and felt a profound longing for her friends and family.

Trisha moved to Japan in the hope of a better career opportunity. She had always dreamed of working for an anime studio, and when she received a job offer from a prestigious company in Tokyo, she couldn't refuse. So she packed her bags, took a deep breath, and relocated to a foreign land.

She had anticipated it would be challenging but had no idea how much. Language was a significant barrier, understanding and communicating in Japanese was daunting. Interacting with her co-workers, dealing with bureaucracy, even ordering food from a menu, became a struggle.

Culture shock was another difficult beast to tame. The Japanese work ethic, the customs, the traditions, were all new to her. She had to constantly remind herself to be polite, patient, and persevering, even when she felt frustrated and lost.

She would often find herself crying at the end of the day, exhausted physically and emotionally. The fun had faded, replaced by the grim reality of her struggles. But in these moments, she realized, it was important to count her blessings.

She was in Japan, a country she had always admired from afar. She was working for an anime studio, living out her dream. She had an apartment, a job, food on the table, and supportive friends back home.

Life was tough, sure, but she was tougher. In her adversity, she found strength, resilience, and perseverance she didn't know she had. She started to grasp the language better, started understanding the culture, and started making friends.

The struggle of moving to a different country was real, but so was her determination. It was a battle she was willing to fight, and with each passing day, she was winning. The fun was not in the nightlife of Tokyo, but in the journey, she had embarked on, and the person she was becoming because of it.","28,13,60,234,176,310,12,328,118,325,298,37,312,33,95,231,301,127,94,24,219,187,209,268,321,180,10,74,65,262,80,326,11,217,313,49,96,19,255,16,113,131,205,221,269,278,299,192,264,302,181,223,17,79,157,283,75,216,98,84,54,63,3,244,68,146,126,34,91,303,105,213,327,110,78,322,93,172,330,114,4,186,159,14,163,195,335,227,291,32,198,334,178,179,272,30,284,90,7,207,142,108,51,276,59,42,2,103,139,338,101,247,119,282,92,259,43,112,229,8,56,336,233,31,35,267,214,254,258,77,232,1,261,0,164,23,161,67,249,70,304,271,99,270,251,171,45,183,203,320,9,199,162,306,174,88,69,257,324,6,184,252,122,245,168,228,115,260,323,210,158,248,170,81,47,72,226,130,5,316,26,253,124,145,190,104,241,243,143,230,211,21,277,250,57,289,274,194,212,58","134,132,107,63,81,179,160,99,120,151,27,33,7,2,84,40,53","1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110"
16,"The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.","At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears gleaming. From the sparkling red carpets they walk on to the adoring fans that clamor for their autographs, it seems like they have it all. The flash of cameras on their faces makes them shine even brighter. To many, celebrities live in a world that is not just glamorous but also carefree and full of success. Their life appears to be a dream come true, brimming with fame, fortune, and the privilege to be globally recognized and loved.

However, like the old saying goes, not all that glitters is gold. Behind those glittering sequins and dazzling smiles, there lies a raw and startling reality. A reality that is often masked by the thick layers of makeup, brand endorsements, and shining golden trophies. A reality that reveals that celebrities actually face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.

The incessant scrutiny by the media and fans are just the tip of the iceberg. Every aspect of their life is under public eye, their actions dissected, their words interpreted and reinterpreted, leading to rumors, controversies and public backlash. Even their personal life is often subject to speculations and scandalous headlines, stripping them off their basic human right to privacy.

The pressure to maintain a flawless image can become overwhelming. They are expected to always look perfect, behave impeccably, and continuously churn out impeccable work. Every mistake they make is magnified, even leading to vicious trolling and hate comments on social media.

And then, there's the fierce competition within the industry. Every celebrity is on a race to stay relevant, to stay in the public eye. The constant struggle to stay on top can lead to severe stress, anxiety and even depression. Furthermore, their hectic schedule, comprising of erratic work hours, filming in harsh conditions and constant travelling can take a toll on their physical and mental health.

Their wealth, though abundant, often leads to legal and financial complications. It also attracts fake relationships and fair-weather friends who hang around only for their fortune. 

Celebrities also deal with loneliness. Despite being constantly surrounded by a team of people, they often have no one who truly understands their journey or their problems. It’s a sea of shallow acquaintances with very few genuine connections.

In truth, the life of a celebrity, though glittering, is a lonely road, riddled with troubles hidden beneath a façade of perfection. All said and done, being a celebrity is not just about the glitz and glamour, it’s a path less traveled with its own set of perks and pitfalls. And the problems they face? They're often far greater than anyone could possibly imagine.","208,328,153,104,56,31,297,146,94,200,229,215,93,44,263,123,314,220,236,216,184,87,201,120,311,242,22,192,39,193,305,67,150,250,54,180,194,113,265,58,130,142,109,230,4,320,57,149,131,41,26,75,60,168,224,246,330,307,203,80,197,244,333,228,49,290,137,251,125,199,270,248,10,185,7,76,310,23,50,189,96,195,84,296,118,2,1,292,219,61,231,83,114,69,30,317,19,100,90,3,12,13,89,198,72,274,188,206,42,82,79,308,288,102,141,260,245,6,202,160,62,28,237,107,140,139,171,227,223,51,178,163,164,45,11,316,155,73,74,329,98,286,157,71,91,15,17,277,204,222,33,35,14,259,173,249,276,302,339,136,298,213,210,299,176,103,334,127,225,319,77,88,312,108,187,147,101,132,97,106,53,165,46,116,152,95,214,9,133,322,59,172,5,291,336,186,111,8,321,0","200,87,86,100,45,193,118,75,198,188,73,135,101,102,153,146,147","1, 86, 87, 150, 153, 155, 188, 190, 192, 194"
17,She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.,"She had always been captivated by the facade of her neighbor's home. Every time she left her house and turned to look at it, she couldn't help but admire its striking elegance. It was painted in a tasteful shade of lavender, adorned with well-crafted wooden shutters and surrounded by a beautiful manicured garden full of vibrant flowers and lush greenery. Her house, on the other hand, was simple and plain.

Its charm had been muted by years of weathering. The paint peeled away in places, the lawn was unkempt, and a few shingles were missing from the roof. Every time she looked at her neighbor's house, she was filled with a sense of longing and a bit of envy. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own, and she wished for the same level of beauty.

However, what she didn't realize was the amount of effort her neighbor invested to maintain the appeal of her home. The immaculate garden required daily watering, pruning, and weeding. The lavender paint needed touching up every couple of years, and the wooden shutters had to be refinished to protect them from the elements. The neighbor spent endless hours and a considerable amount of money to keep the house looking its best.

One day, she casually mentioned her admiration for the neighbor's home while they were both picking up their mail. She complimented the neighbor's impeccable taste and expressed her desire to emulate the same for her own home.

The neighbor smiled graciously and thanked her for the compliments. However, she also mentioned the intensive upkeep and constant attention her house demanded. She talked about the sweat-soaked weekends spent trimming hedges, the painstaking process of picking out the perfect shade of lavender paint, and the ongoing battles with pests determined to ruin her garden.

Her words brought her an unexpected revelation. She had been so blinded by the allure of the neighbor's house that she had failed to consider the effort it took to keep it that way. She thought back to her own home, simple as it was, and realized its maintenance was hardly as demanding.

In hindsight, her plain, low-maintenance house suddenly felt more comforting. It was her home, filled with warmth, peace, and memories, and it required just enough upkeep to stay functional and cozy. It didn't demand her constant attention or drain her energy like her neighbor's high-maintenance home.

She still admired her neighbor's house for its aesthetic appeal, but no longer felt the same sense of longing and envy she once did. She was now content with her own home, recognizing the hidden charm and simplicity it held. After all, a house's worth is measured not by its outward beauty, but by the comfort and happiness it provides to those who dwell within it.","317,40,137,2,136,81,107,138,239,183,256,58,262,237,96,258,298,308,157,159,24,156,194,56,92,82,168,105,332,190,99,10,41,11,214,133,301,310,45,135,6,84,229,3,119,20,5,78,89,267,35,127,319,174,250,224,147,218,85,296,98,222,94,86,312,49,270,36,95,225,297,336,321,234,235,144,287,53,231,295,14,232,33,306,4,299,176,223,197,266,37,184,261,15,303,149,0,285,251,64,51,171,202,272,173,97,29,160,248,325,265,139,288,130,62,158,313,338,286,80,19,23,161,1,9,26,151,189,193,114,32,252,69,150,73,27,44,63,66,55,249,328,322,7,88,307,68,61,259,143,129,275,331,103,292,121,274,264,315,180,220,13,165,199,179,257,115,241,302,8,240,203,326,228,140,75,74,50,277,243,200,245,16,324,162,172,198,289,12,300,284,201,255,30,155,52,226,268,227,38","97,124,4,44,85,47,41,144,170,125,32,34,189,162,81,94,183","1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
18,After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.,"After an exhausting day of simmering emotions, John finally decided to let out his rage in an eruption of anger. This wasn't his typical self; he was often regarded as a man of composure and calm demeanor. However, on this day, it seemed as if everything had piled up beyond his capacity to withhold it any longer. 

It started with an early morning dispute at his workplace, which ultimately led to a complete mishap of a project he had tirelessly spent months developing. The assistant he had entrusted the details to had messed up, resulting in massive data loss. The failed project ended up being a disaster in front of the board of directors and cost John his promotion.

To add fuel to the fire, his personal life was no different. His wife had grown distant after being busy with her book launch, and his teenagers were engrossed in their own world. He had been feeling ignored, lonely, and frustrated. 

Upon arriving home that evening, the final straw came when he discovered that his oldest son had crashed his beloved, vintage car. This was the car he had spent countless hours restoring, a reminder of his youthful days. The rage he had been suppressing all day came bursting out like a volcano. He yelled at his son, his voice echoing through the silent house.

The fallout of his rage was powerful. His son, stunned by his outburst, just stood there without uttering a word. His wife ran out from the kitchen, a look of shock on her face. Even his younger daughter peeked out from her room, her eyes wide with fear.

His family stood there stunned, unable to process this unexpected side of John. After his moment of fury, there was complete silence in the house. Every heated word he had yelled hung heavy in the air.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he collapsed onto his favorite armchair. His rage had left him, replaced now by an overwhelming sense of regret. He looked at his trembling hands and, for a moment, did not recognize the man he had become.

Gone was his fiery temper, replaced now by a subdued meekness. It was as if his rage had been a storm, powerful and destructive, and now he was the calm after it. He sat down, defeated and quiet, much like a lamb that had given in to its fate.

In the aftermath of his angry outburst, John felt the full weight of his actions. He realized how his pent-up frustration had caused harm to the ones he loved the most. From that moment on, he pledged to handle his anger and stress more effectively, taking this unfortunate event as a learning experience.","78,324,285,287,162,129,260,22,180,297,127,176,235,122,334,171,177,283,165,138,226,25,118,291,299,288,315,265,93,321,220,203,24,68,172,62,31,15,338,204,91,264,45,319,13,200,145,137,155,300,262,11,267,134,317,309,21,290,49,336,60,173,252,59,23,314,90,7,1,102,187,269,322,99,32,100,92,293,277,151,119,303,26,6,251,206,178,29,335,192,140,216,30,183,312,241,156,292,307,228,218,105,83,94,9,258,133,148,19,48,339,107,289,160,302,236,85,279,34,135,104,313,233,16,111,144,51,326,166,38,98,255,141,75,304,268,185,28,270,208,197,318,191,20,143,230,202,58,306,76,327,157,124,199,242,74,266,237,214,331,61,198,153,248,320,316,109,281,328,8,103,224,97,184,212,39,282,286,169,117,116,167,81,245,47,308,65,337,311,256,188,201,67,275,301,273,209,239,27,196","109,144,57,8,65,33,22,83,199,138,88,93,37","1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
19,The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.,"For an entire week, the town had been battered by incessant, violent storms. The sky was a relentless shade of charcoal, thunder growling like a territorial beast. Electric veins spidered across the heavens, sporadically illuminating the otherwise grey world in harsh, white light. The once serene town had turned into a battleground where nature was displaying its power through rain, wind, and hail.

Even the usually bustling market square was deserted. Shops were tightly shuttered, lights dimmed, their wares protected from the onslaught of the tempest. The ever-chirpy birds had also sought refuge, their usual harmonious songs replaced with the violent symphony of the storm.

Residents, once lively and hospitable, were now huddled in their homes, praying for the violent weather to pass. Children peered nervously from behind curtains, their wide eyes reflecting the lightning outside. Schools remained closed, parks desolate, and the roads empty, save for the sporadic brave soul venturing out for necessary errands.

Mayor Robinson had declared a state of emergency. He ensured everyone that every possible step was being taken for their safety. But he too longed for the violent weather to pass, his worry lines echoing the town's silent plea.

The storm raged on, seemingly oblivious to the chaos it was causing. The creek swelled, flirting dangerously with its banks. The old willow tree, once a symbol of the town's endurance, gave in, succumbing to the relentless winds. It was as if nature was venting out an age-old fury, a lament for a wrong not righted.

On the eighth day, it happened. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week. With the dawn came a shy, golden sunlight that timidly touched the storm-ravaged town. The once menacing sky was now a tender blue, adorned by fluffy, white clouds. Birds perched on the rooftops, breaking the silence with their melodious songs.

With the sun's touch, life began to stir. Cautiously, residents began to emerge from their homes, their expressions mirroring the surprise and relief the weather change had brought. Children laughed and jumped in puddles, reclaiming their right to play. Shop owners began to open their stores, smiles slowly returning to their faces.

Mayor Robinson stepped onto his porch, a sigh of relief escaping his lips as he felt the warmth of the sun. The old town had weathered another storm, he thought. It would rise, recover, and rebuild, just as it had done numerous times before. Even in the aftermath of the storm, there was a newfound hope. The storm had passed, but the resilience of the town and its people shone brighter than ever.","151,310,320,333,170,74,337,55,269,76,129,290,36,126,326,128,37,102,280,53,187,150,81,100,109,225,179,107,208,21,212,230,168,46,284,143,149,202,25,197,26,98,103,69,63,112,78,273,75,133,308,252,16,214,33,338,11,286,20,305,97,233,241,4,238,10,266,279,245,288,43,38,191,135,65,302,242,249,246,332,223,84,292,94,108,335,303,58,258,142,59,48,1,287,154,91,67,190,171,267,77,314,237,22,198,321,239,218,138,166,60,162,29,24,13,172,299,210,117,293,15,298,265,216,164,283,93,127,260,66,313,8,235,62,124,189,45,217,262,175,27,229,111,87,35,312,18,131,72,5,270,173,47,219,125,278,315,50,14,86,180,264,250,194,307,201,31,285,119,17,195,256,165,319,282,118,90,23,140,226,169,318,155,30,221,294,211,185,161,99,323,183,316,121,317,145,243,104,328,28","147,59,30,104,178,114,39,41,141,200,113,184,167","1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
20,Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.,"Once, in the small town of Ellesmere, lived a young, effervescent girl named Amelia. She was known for her radiant smile and an aura that was as bright as sunshine. However, behind that jovial facade, she nursed a broken heart. She was in love with her best friend, Jack, who was blissfully unaware of her feelings.

One fateful night, Jack introduced Amelia to his new girlfriend, Sophie. The news shattered Amelia. She could not fathom life without Jack by her side. He was oblivious of the storm that brewed in Amelia's heart as they laughed and chatted with Sophie.

Feeling pained and betrayed, she returned home with a heavy heart. She climbed up to her room, collapsing on the bed, tears streaming down her cheeks. The world seemed to have crumbled around her. She felt alone, the pain gnawing at her heart, as she cried into the night. Her pillow soaked with sorrowful tears, her heart burdened with love that would never be reciprocated.

All through the night, she clutched her chest, trying to contain her heart that seemed to shatter into a million pieces. Every tick of the clock echoed her throbbing heart, every dark corner of her room reflecting the abyss she felt within.

However, despite the heartache that held her hostage, Amelia was a resilient girl. She knew she had to keep going, even if her heart ached with every beat. She decided to face the world with a brave front. She decided not to let her love for Jack overshadow the unbreakable bond they shared as friends.

As dawn broke, she forced herself to get out of bed. She looked at her reflection in the mirror; her eyes were swollen from all the crying. But instead of dwelling on the sadness, she chose to fix herself. She washed her face and decided that day would be the start of her healing process.

She managed to plaster a radiant smile as she greeted her parents at the breakfast table. She even managed to laugh at her father's jokes and engaged in a cheerful conversation with her mom. The pain was there, stinging with every beat, but she masked it well.

Later in the day, she saw Jack and Sophie at school, their hands entwined, and smiles that mirrored each other's happiness. She felt a pang of sorrow, a tightening in her chest, but she managed to greet them, her smile as bright as ever.

Her sunny disposition caught everyone off guard. None suspected the anguish behind her radiant smile. Amelia taught everyone that day that no matter how much it hurts, you should always keep your chin up and greet everyone like sunshine. She cried the entire night, but she woke up like nothing happened. That was Amelia, the girl who loved, lost, but never stopped being herself.","229,240,125,2,71,95,172,53,94,160,255,329,150,189,147,216,273,179,283,39,139,217,32,37,19,274,14,265,4,201,307,252,276,16,315,312,98,65,162,13,280,220,319,204,299,164,316,158,245,197,9,123,79,187,305,195,333,225,325,80,22,100,121,286,262,29,176,323,89,154,60,271,83,304,237,74,234,308,275,192,166,214,58,258,68,212,28,75,85,18,238,11,336,219,27,200,279,206,211,112,108,64,171,35,193,26,153,87,30,52,41,57,145,21,337,242,191,338,117,24,311,310,203,173,261,122,264,268,119,23,267,124,178,282,185,181,259,97,103,42,63,335,46,290,231,322,246,278,293,174,127,228,309,82,56,81,226,96,38,221,91,10,232,77,54,210,326,321,205,59,196,165,168,132,17,118,135,66,25,86,186,213,33,298,102,128,116,149,194,31,101,131,289,301,257,104,70,67,235,318","90,25,114,61,130,120,179,106,95,87,66,109,190","1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
21,A soft breeze blew after the gust of wind shook down the shacks.,"Once upon a time, in a coastal village tucked away from the bustling cities, the weather was unpredictable and often severe. The villagers knew to brace for gales, but one day, an exceptionally strong gust of wind swept through, more ferocious than anything they had ever seen. A gust so strong, it shook the very foundations of the village's shacks. Wooden boards creaked, nails loosened, and windows rattled under the powerful assault.

The wind howled, slithering its way through the narrow passageways between the shacks, an invisible yet palpable monster. Terrified villagers huddled in their homes, praying for the wind's wrath to pass. Children clung to their parents, their eyes wide with fear. The older folks, who had seen many storms, muttered that they had never witnessed such fury before.

Each shack groaned under the pressure, struggling to hold itself up against the gale. The gust roared louder and, in one decisive moment, it seemed as if the shacks bowed to the wind's might, their structures trembling, threatening to collapse. There was an eerie silence in the seconds that followed, with everyone holding their breath. Then, with a sound like the world splitting in two, several shacks crumbled to the ground.

There was a collective gasp, a shared feeling of horror, as the dust from the fallen homes rose into the air. The force of the wind had left a path of destruction through the heart of the village. Families who had lost their homes stared at the ruins in shock, the reality of their loss not fully sinking in.

The gust eventually lessened, retreating as suddenly as it had attacked. The village was draped in an uneasy silence, the chaos replaced by the grim aftermath. The breeze that followed seemed out of place, a soft whisper compared to the loud roar that had just passed.

As the soft breeze blew, the dust settled, revealing the extent of the damage. The surviving villagers ventured out of their homes, their faces wearing expressions of disbelief. There were tears, there were silent curses, and there were sighs of relief from those whose homes stood firm. 

The soft breeze seemed to bring with it a sense of calm, perhaps nature's way of apologizing for the destruction it had caused. The villagers, though stunned and saddened, were resilient. They came together, helping those who had lost their homes. Their spirit was stronger than the gust that had rattled them.

In the face of adversity, the village found unity, found strength in each other. The soft breeze carried with it stories of their resilience, spreading across the village, whispering tales of their courage. The day the gust of wind shook down the shacks was remembered, not for the destruction it caused but for the strength and unity it kindled.","336,186,29,200,197,28,126,214,286,168,138,318,196,211,95,195,177,159,24,23,242,46,111,332,104,122,176,277,5,188,163,274,99,222,144,14,306,65,262,62,295,120,30,145,11,19,167,206,74,191,164,175,32,47,333,251,334,202,22,240,165,261,147,119,44,311,220,278,260,298,25,15,317,269,161,40,8,171,152,96,143,42,67,288,255,87,230,105,215,285,241,276,98,209,128,86,26,20,142,131,297,56,294,194,121,102,52,254,141,150,252,184,282,85,78,110,7,18,267,101,93,265,116,166,275,316,228,247,313,249,287,284,309,118,17,339,77,54,305,235,201,229,263,308,136,271,293,127,283,300,331,248,112,320,178,173,234,338,330,57,2,239,154,258,37,224,280,326,4,187,170,324,108,69,156,231,31,94,134,90,272,183,155,174,185,160,307,182,151,205,27,58,266,246,41,107,192,169,223,115","118,46,98,59,20,19,71,97,191,6,3,43,177","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
22,"As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.","Once upon a time, in a quiet town nestled amidst snow-capped mountains, people lived in harmony with nature. They cherished their simple lifestyles, reliant on small fireplaces for warmth. One evening, as the sun bid farewell to the day, people retired into their homes. A single flame flickered in one such humble abode, where an old woman named Elsa lived. 

Elsa, a woman revered for her wisdom and grace, sat by the fire, lost in her thoughts. As the flame danced in the fireplace, its playful luminescence brought a sense of comfort to her heart. This was her nightly routine, a moment she savored in the tranquility of her home.

Elsa's eyes, with their years of acquired wisdom, watched the flame in the fireplace. It danced joyfully, its light casting a glow on Elsa's weathered face. Time seemed to stand still as the flame danced on, casting playful shadows on the room's wooden walls. But gradually, the flame began to shrink, its light dimming with every passing moment. 

With a final flicker, it shrank to an ember, then a mere spark. A moment later, the flame vanished, leaving behind a soft glow as its final testament. Elsa's heart seemed to sigh with it, resonating with the flame's journey. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.

This thin wisp of smoke was almost ethereal, blending in with the twilight leaking through the cabin's window. It hung in the air for a moment, before spiraling upwards, vanishing through the chimney and into the winter night.

Seeing this, Elsa felt a pang of sadness. For her, the extinguishing flame was symbolic of the fleeting time. The fading flame, the wafting smoke, all reminders of her own mortality, her own journey from a radiant youth to a dignified old age.

But as she saw the smoke vanish into the night, she also felt a sense of relief. The smoke's journey didn't end with the flame. It transformed and ascended, leaving its mark in its own way. Like the flame, she too had a journey to finish, and a mark to leave.

The thin wisp of smoke left behind by the extinguished flame was not a sign of defeat. It was a sign of transformation, a reminder of life's cyclicality, of the inevitable transition from one form to another. The flame might have extinguished, but the glow it left behind was still warm. The smoke might have vanished, but it continued to exist in the frosty air of the winter night.

In the flame's extinguishing, Elsa found an acceptance of her own impending twilight. She had lived, loved, and learned. Just like the flame, she had danced her dance, given her light, and warmed those around her. Her time to rest would come, but her journey wouldn’t end. Like the thin wisp of smoke, she would ascend, leaving behind a legacy of her warmth and wisdom. 

The flame extinguished, but Elsa's spirit burned brighter. For she had understood life's most profound lesson, a lesson passed on by a single flame's journey and the thin wisp of smoke it left behind.","189,322,197,23,167,79,162,115,317,6,292,146,331,225,203,242,337,157,44,73,125,303,78,65,252,18,88,117,176,238,324,138,335,265,140,26,39,40,142,171,145,139,304,29,103,290,249,128,276,158,310,212,31,192,143,181,228,54,114,92,318,64,56,149,314,202,257,98,160,154,105,241,71,107,172,61,300,209,271,28,275,151,120,27,165,237,220,58,221,235,49,299,121,251,55,295,288,327,186,207,130,316,156,159,147,4,315,35,46,211,87,10,298,297,309,51,169,254,11,43,144,24,102,137,16,269,99,339,193,255,152,284,118,239,267,230,218,17,126,13,0,21,233,308,243,190,191,323,205,313,198,36,301,232,274,217,95,173,302,76,170,33,270,67,30,338,3,19,129,83,214,247,122,279,174,166,253,244,180,135,155,250,163,74,183,240,185,20,188,229,25,328,245,291,150,14,325,89,296,47","26,168,188,142,4,122,191,36,84,80,44,165,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
23,He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.,"Young Tommy was notoriously known for his insatiable love for sweets. His parents, doting and indulgent, could never say no to his puppy-eyed requests for candies, cookies, and all things saccharine. One Saturday, Tommy's grandma visited, her bag brimming with an assortment of vibrant candies, all for her beloved grandson.

The sight of Grandma's candy-filled bag sent Tommy into a joyous frenzy. His eyes lit up like fireworks on a moonless night. He dived into the pile of candies as if it were a treasure chest he had been longing to find. 

Each candy wrapper crinkled under his eager little fingers, a prelude to the explosion of flavors he was about to experience. He unwrapped lollipops, sucked on hard candies, and tore open chocolate wrappers like it was Christmas morning. His parents watched him with fond amusement, and Grandma chuckled at Tommy's delight.

In the midst of this sugar fest, Tommy grabbed a particularly large chocolate bar. His taste buds exploded with the intense flavor of cocoa and hazelnuts, creating a sweetness symphony in his mouth. His energy surged, fueled by the high sugar dose, propelling him into an unusually vibrant state.

Seized by a sudden inspiration, Tommy jumped to his feet. The entire living room transformed into his stage. He twirled, he swirled, he jumped, and even attempted a clumsy pirouette. His laughter filled the house, ringing like melodious bells, joyous and contagious. His parents clapped and encouraged him, their faces glowing with parental pride.

Tommy danced his heart out, every step as jubilant as the candy-induced rush. The sugar high driving his energy levels turned the room into a blur of colors and motion. He was unstoppable, a whirlwind of boundless excitement and childish exuberance. His dance gradually turned into a frenzied interpretive performance, inspired by his imaginative mind.

Minutes ticked by, but Tommy was lost in his sweet, sugary world. He was a pirate, then a knight, then a superhero, his dance evolving with every new imaginary adventure. His parents, accustomed to his dramatic play, watched their son's display in awe, swept up in the magic of his playful antics.

Finally, after what seemed like hours, the sugar high began to ebb. His steps became less energetic, his pirouettes slower, his jumps lower. Tommy's little heart was still dancing, but his body was beginning to feel the exhaustion from the joyous sugar-fueled dance.

His moves gradually turned into slow, rhythmic sways. His eyelids drooped, struggling to stay open. With the last of his energy, he spun around one last time before he collapsed onto the soft carpet, his arms sprawled out and a content smile playing on his lips. The living room was quiet, the only sound being his deep, rhythmic breathing.

As his parents gently scooped up their sleeping boy to tuck him into bed, they shared a knowing smile. Their little Tommy had danced off his sugar high and promptly fell asleep, dreaming of candies, no doubt. They cherished these moments, watching their boy grow, knowing that these were the memories they would fondly look back on.","260,132,26,338,302,106,318,210,135,234,25,94,24,306,238,227,62,154,169,212,328,43,236,14,187,17,269,271,215,319,69,125,219,54,161,86,160,32,133,178,153,262,324,52,233,186,146,327,22,18,104,142,156,30,182,3,265,267,278,5,53,253,183,11,331,60,119,36,91,333,99,118,185,204,130,263,101,162,166,87,131,39,79,200,76,139,111,56,113,152,216,100,290,13,250,0,249,126,259,27,149,239,75,330,228,148,223,116,48,288,124,38,147,6,314,108,208,190,317,46,297,229,28,312,217,137,335,226,16,145,281,37,68,136,20,339,284,9,261,294,248,280,237,21,114,194,304,123,206,82,307,207,268,277,81,292,192,266,67,279,315,296,8,184,321,61,140,246,90,29,134,291,103,143,167,55,283,286,298,84,121,222,92,270,231,252,63,42,151,285,293,300,85,171,31,115,193,170,19,128","50,199,135,144,49,13,11,3,100,123,170,54,195","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
24,My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.,"I have a pet dog named Buster who's full of energy and absolutely loves to play. We've owned him since he was just a young puppy and over the years, his affinity for frisbees has only increased. Whether it's a game in the park or in our very own backyard, Buster is always game for a good old session of frisbee.

One day, I decided to dedicate the whole day to playing with Buster. We began our day early in the morning, right after his breakfast. The weather was perfect; a cool breeze was blowing and the sun was out, but not too strong. I grabbed his favorite red frisbee and we headed towards the park.

As soon as Buster saw the frisbee in my hand, his tail began to wag uncontrollably. He could hardly contain his excitement. He lunged forward, ready to chase the frisbee wherever it went. I threw the frisbee and off he went, running as fast as his little legs could take him. 

The joy in his eyes when he caught his first frisbee of the day was indescribable. He looked so proud, trotting back to me with the frisbee in his mouth. This process continued for several hours. He would fetch the frisbee, I would throw it again, and the cycle would repeat. 

The sun began to set, the park slowly emptying out. Buster, however, showed no signs of fatigue. It was as if he had unlimited reserves of energy stored within him. Even though my arm was beginning to ache from throwing the frisbee so many times, I couldn't stop; not when Buster was enjoying himself so much.

Finally, under the canvas of a star-filled night, exhaustion seemed to catch up with Buster. He returned the frisbee to me but instead of nudging my hand for another round, he collapsed on the grass. Panting heavily, he gave me a weary smile.

His day was finally done. My pet dog, Buster, was down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee. He had a look of utter contentment on his face as he fell asleep. I gently picked him up and carried him home. It was a day well spent, full of laughter and joy, and I was sure Buster dreamt of frisbees that night.","92,174,308,338,68,136,90,218,11,118,332,20,267,271,26,239,104,303,65,95,100,126,279,307,231,224,265,54,284,246,262,109,266,115,74,50,134,188,316,222,139,150,156,257,63,221,151,73,334,167,277,328,212,179,294,23,297,160,17,276,166,76,190,183,137,37,191,18,173,215,69,77,228,143,112,180,130,229,206,172,281,105,125,302,240,1,48,81,216,58,98,147,306,177,148,16,162,78,84,255,189,21,75,325,31,309,51,93,60,201,225,101,29,10,234,313,45,72,70,153,192,22,310,25,288,263,122,196,87,305,194,291,256,140,59,19,299,219,152,175,124,223,330,170,274,322,154,28,149,15,64,226,283,260,108,199,250,178,4,159,158,203,27,261,238,312,295,132,131,107,155,79,116,35,146,337,38,5,236,3,142,207,86,30,301,83,315,202,193,157,184,335,164,282,42,232,252,331,326,176","68,136,12,102,122,56,124,15,163,148,113,184,105","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119"
25,Their company is so debt-ridden due to erratic management that I think it's safe to say they're about to go bankrupt.,"In the heart of New York City, in a glimmering skyscraper, sat a once-thriving company known as Equinox Solutions. Now, that once radiant beacon of success was more like a ship sailing through a perfect storm. The situation was dire; their company had become so debt-ridden, it was barely afloat. It was an unfortunate outcome, largely because of erratic management, they were about to hit rock bottom.

I had been a part of Equinox Solutions since its inception, a company that started with a bang, offering groundbreaking services that had us shooting up the ranks. But over time, I started to witness the company's downward spiral. The initial spark of ambition, innovation and success had been quenched by the tumultuous waves of uncalculated risks and poor decisions. 

The management had become erratic, making decisions that seemed to follow no pattern or rationale. Key positions were filled by under-qualified individuals, while those who had the company's best interest at heart were pushed aside. Instead of putting profits back into the company, managers lavishly spent money on retreats and extravagant company parties. Moreover, they expanded the company prematurely, taking on more clients than we had the resources to handle. This erratic management had landed us in a sea of debt, and as a senior staff, it was a heartbreaking sight.

Investors were wary, customers were fleeing, and employees were leaving in droves. Salaries were often paid late, and morale was at an all-time low. I could see our once-lustrous reputation tarnishing before my very eyes. We were no longer a company that inspired trust, but a sinking ship that everyone was eager to abandon.

We tried to implement austerity measures, cutting costs wherever we could. We laid off half our staff, reduced our office space, and even tried renegotiating deals with our clients. But it was like trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol; the debt was simply too overwhelming.

From an outside perspective, it was obvious to me that we were sinking. Despite my efforts to save the company, I had to come to terms with the harsh reality. Equinox Solutions was no longer the vibrant powerhouse it once was. 

So, with a heavy heart, I had to admit, it was safe to say that Equinox Solutions was about to go bankrupt. As I stepped out of that glimmering skyscraper for the last time, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of sadness. But amidst the sorrow, I knew I'd learned invaluable lessons about leadership, accountability, and the dire consequences of erratic management.","30,119,197,117,178,36,303,70,78,179,18,280,283,157,42,114,201,196,277,48,312,271,298,90,120,258,85,206,255,28,310,316,26,74,14,139,93,339,121,118,155,95,132,176,171,265,116,106,236,108,31,41,29,318,113,323,284,189,13,123,233,302,24,133,223,186,289,234,315,58,185,187,256,112,180,264,17,144,53,1,232,128,145,89,4,334,105,2,253,122,22,300,259,97,99,306,307,175,279,104,115,286,294,204,275,268,77,251,129,27,156,69,8,16,135,54,34,287,242,20,167,221,269,225,151,60,220,319,127,328,21,11,190,19,278,23,62,80,174,195,212,110,321,192,272,260,230,173,257,229,237,214,147,273,79,39,297,301,68,166,125,336,152,309,295,211,103,261,183,313,38,262,248,107,91,202,254,61,182,266,200,209,100,325,111,224,158,159,216,45,87,240,333,52,55,288,293,141,153,231","11,134,120,131,91,136,63,33,110,30,53,1,51","1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
26,"On his last birthday, Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight.","Mike, a software engineer and a man of simple tastes, had always looked forward to his birthdays. In a normal scenario, he would be surrounded by his close friends, enjoying a quiet dinner at his favorite Italian restaurant. However, on his last birthday, the scenario was altered drastically by his high school friend, Jacob.

Jacob, a man of exuberance and energy, was quite the opposite of Mike. Years ago, they had drifted apart due to their contrasting lifestyles. But when Jacob moved back to town recently, he decided to reconnect with Mike on his birthday.

On the eve of Mike's birthday, Jacob made a surprise visit to Mike’s apartment. Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, brought along a selection of Mike’s favorite beers, wines, and some spirits too. Mike, not wanting to seem rude and also welcoming this unexpected surprise, decided to go along with Jacob's plans.

It started off as an evening of reminiscing, with both of them sharing old tales from their high school days over drinks. However, as the night wore on, the drinking increased in both quantity and frequency. Mike, usually a responsible drinker, found it difficult to resist the friendly peer pressure and the wide array of beverages at his disposal.

Not being a frequent drinker, Mike's tolerance level was low. And by ten, under Jacob’s mischievous encouragement, Mike was already well beyond his limit. Despite the room spinning and his head throbbing, Mike continued the drinking spree, laughing and sharing stories from their past.

The fun continued, with Jacob pulling out board games and even doing impromptu karaoke. Amidst all this festivity, Mike failed to notice the onslaught of alcohol-induced fatigue creeping up on him. By the time it was nearly midnight, Mike was slurring his words, struggling to stay upright on his couch.

At precisely five minutes before midnight, the exact minute of his birth, Mike's world began to blur. His head felt as heavy as a rock, and he realized that he was losing consciousness. Despite his efforts to fight it, Mike finally succumbed to the overwhelming drowsiness.

Jacob, upon noticing his friend’s plight, quickly sprung into action. He helped Mike onto a comfortable resting position on the couch and ensured he was sleeping on his side. He then spent the remainder of the night watching over Mike, occasionally laughing and shaking his head at the sight of his friend's incapacity.

When Mike woke up the next morning, he found a note from Jacob, teasing him about not being able to handle his drinks. Despite the throbbing headache and nauseous feeling, Mike couldn't help but laugh at the unexpected turn his birthday had taken.

27,"After going through an extensive workload, Ally got very sick and will be doing nothing but rest during this weekend.","Ally loved her job as a senior researcher at a pharmaceutical company. She loved the thrill of the hunt for new discoveries, which led her to take on multiple projects simultaneously. However, the workload became overbearing in recent months, increasing drastically from what she was used to. Day after day, she buried herself in experiments, paperwork, and conferences.

Ally didn't mind the long hours, losing herself in the intricate details of her work. She skimped on sleep, took meals at odd hours, and largely ignored her health in her quest for the next big breakthrough. Her weekends weren't exempt either. Her entire life became a whirlwind of tests, trials, and analyses.

Eventually, this lifestyle took a toll on her health. One Thursday afternoon, while pouring over a new set of data, she suddenly felt dizzy. She tried to shake it off, blaming it on the glaring computer screen, but a wave of nausea soon followed.

""Are you okay, Ally?"" asked her colleague, noticing her sudden pallor. But Ally could barely respond before the room started spinning, her vision blurred, and she fell unconscious.

Upon waking up in the hospital, she found out that she had been running on an empty tank for quite some time. Her doctor said she was severely stressed and malnourished, diagnosing her with acute exhaustion. He sternly advised her to slow down and take some rest, highlighting the importance of self-care.

Her colleagues were understandably worried and her boss made it clear that her health was the priority. ""No work for you until you're completely better, Ally,"" he declared, pushing her to take the coming weekend off entirely for rest. He reassured her that the team would manage the ongoing projects, emphasizing she needed to focus on recovery.

Ally nodded slowly, the prospect of a weekend without her precious research felt strange, yet necessary. She understood the importance of rest, as she had been neglecting it for quite a while. She planned to take this break to replenish her energy, both physically and mentally.

That weekend, Ally did nothing but rest. She stayed in bed, took warm baths, and even got a chance to catch up on her favorite mystery novels. The break was refreshing, offering her time to contemplate her lifestyle choices and the importance of balance.

As much as she adored her job, she knew that she had to moderate her work habits and look after her health. Ally decided that from then on, she would maintain a healthier work-life balance, ensuring she was not just a successful researcher, but a healthier and happier individual as well.","135,116,333,176,191,262,113,31,336,202,66,129,123,299,142,208,261,79,28,228,53,112,249,250,303,92,326,309,78,229,95,271,124,86,128,284,72,64,45,43,21,83,300,236,281,201,96,287,30,205,197,16,192,2,258,283,150,198,171,308,311,0,146,324,286,133,314,240,120,33,199,130,263,81,216,104,8,168,166,141,225,149,88,312,170,94,339,144,210,172,335,22,44,9,212,164,325,327,289,70,137,288,71,173,134,47,195,25,254,215,218,188,251,18,292,317,56,278,207,159,275,260,193,265,328,131,231,206,103,256,227,155,313,187,237,331,59,23,305,126,97,310,10,82,121,80,183,239,321,37,211,280,127,24,105,34,115,74,91,161,54,13,156,185,203,226,29,222,296,41,89,180,20,179,241,19,58,255,322,109,214,304,132,174,154,42,46,181,217,182,268,125,209,3,145,84,163,294,26,48","114,176,173,41,92,138,154,108,199,19,167,49,8","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
28,"Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.","My friend, Jessica, has always been a great lover of art, finding beauty in a splash of color, intrigue in complex patterns, and solace in silent, empty canvases. This passion drove her to seize her brushes early one Saturday morning, seeking to transform a blank canvas into a vibrant work of art. Determined, she immersed herself in what was to become a day-long painting marathon. 

The morning sun shone into her small apartment, the light scattering through the open windows and touching her palette. Her heart was pounding with a mix of excitement and nervousness as she prepared to pour out her emotions onto the canvas. She dipped her brush in the hues and began the painting, every stroke a piece of her soul being transferred onto the canvas. As time went by, she grew oblivious to everything around her - the chirping of the birds outside, the ticking of the clock, and even her own growing hunger.

As the afternoon sun started to fade, Jessica remained hunched over her canvas. There was a mesmerizing rhythm to her movements, a dance only she and her brush knew. Drops of sweat rolled down her face as she continually adjusted colors and shapes. The canvas was beginning to come alive, mirroring the vibrant swirl of thoughts that inhabited her mind.

By the time evening fell, her apartment was littered with squeezed paint tubes and used brushes, bearing witness to her persistent endeavor. The moonlight streamed through the window and onto the canvas. She took a step back, her fatigued eyes looking at the marvel she had created. The euphoria of accomplishment combined with exhaustion, creating a strange sense of completeness in her heart. 

After contemplating her piece for several quiet minutes, she let herself collapse onto the floor, spent and utterly drained. Seeing her prone form, I moved to help her up, but she raised her hand to stop me. ""Just a few moments, I need to gather myself,"" she breathed out, a tired smile gracing her paint-splattered face. And so she lay there, her tired eyes never leaving the canvas, refusing to rise for several more minutes. 

Her body was drained but her spirit was soaring, satisfied with the beauty she'd managed to capture. I knew then, as I watched my friend consumed by her passion, that the exhaustion was worth it. Jessica had created something beautiful, transforming a simple canvas into a window to her soul. It was not merely a painting but a testament to her dedication, creativity, and resilience, painted over the span of an entire day. 

This was what it meant to be an artist: to pour your entire being into your work, until you were completely drained but nonetheless satisfied. To refuse to get up for several minutes, simply because you wanted to soak in the sight of your labor's fruit. And Jessica, I realized with a fond smile, was an artist in the truest sense of the word.","58,306,279,194,96,15,26,48,72,247,276,227,236,333,39,177,32,239,167,206,119,155,129,37,68,92,127,21,138,197,230,98,99,17,324,147,36,121,142,275,30,304,291,136,255,309,126,311,43,164,116,182,290,8,95,257,189,73,334,210,50,159,134,106,327,18,185,110,180,285,133,297,328,115,245,3,226,178,137,75,300,235,88,80,87,130,192,277,160,225,55,246,336,51,286,29,261,231,338,151,172,262,24,83,27,52,248,124,102,97,145,270,41,252,200,158,191,228,45,259,302,65,222,332,64,218,176,299,69,195,10,315,90,321,312,260,308,196,93,148,66,146,320,232,175,181,122,317,223,249,211,337,23,135,310,314,117,238,54,108,19,131,33,113,186,282,31,325,56,152,331,84,169,272,254,173,170,322,1,49,318,86,22,79,14,104,111,157,20,71,307,40,174,330,82,213,25,101,284,163","66,161,189,28,183,153,103,197,7,105,96,41,167","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
29,Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.,"Monica was an industrious chef in a small local restaurant in town. Known for her culinary creativity and unfailing dedication, she had an unrivaled passion for making delicious, mouth-watering dishes. However, one weekend in particular stood out in her career, one that eventually forced her to rest on Monday.

Last Saturday, there was a special event at the restaurant - a town festival. To cater to the event, the restaurant owner asked Monica to prepare a plethora of dishes to be served to the locals and visitors alike. Determined to meet the expectations, Monica started her work early in the morning. She chopped, sautéed, baked, and garnished with unparalleled zeal, determined to please every palate.

All weekend she worked tirelessly, her dedication and passion evident in each of the dishes she prepared. She made hundreds of appetizers, main dishes, and desserts, each one carefully crafted with perfection. From a creamy spinach lasagna to roasted chicken with a zesty orange glaze, every dish displayed her culinary prowess. However, by Sunday night, her energy was waning, and her usually lively eyes started showing signs of exhaustion.

Despite the fatigue, Monica worked through the night, cleaning and tidying up the kitchen to prepare for the upcoming week. The once bustling restaurant was now quiet and empty, but her efforts had made a lasting impact. The visitors and locals, who had tasted her food over the weekend, were in awe of her talent and effort.

However, the strain of the weekend had taken a toll on Monica's health. On Monday morning, she woke up with a throbbing headache and fatigued body. Despite her strong will to continue with her work, she realized that she needed to rest and rejuvenate. With heavy reluctance, she picked up her phone and dialed her boss's number.

""I need a leave today. I am not feeling well,"" Monica informed her boss, who was understanding and immediately agreed. The sheer amount of food she had cooked over the weekend and the hard work she had put into it was more than anyone could have been expected to handle.

Sighing with relief, Monica hung up, deciding to spend her day recuperating. She had always been a workaholic, but that Monday, she understood the importance of rest. The eventful weekend in the restaurant had not only showcased her exceptional culinary skills but also taught her an important lesson: Even the most passionate and dedicated need rest and recovery to continue doing what they love.","25,214,144,53,66,58,296,161,86,22,48,207,21,72,7,232,20,205,143,104,236,14,334,276,98,300,200,305,95,229,293,280,267,17,59,323,57,290,320,24,41,328,222,260,146,321,97,292,50,65,91,217,289,258,133,152,35,127,301,19,338,270,96,82,124,176,51,190,15,216,211,120,54,287,269,310,246,126,226,180,257,185,42,261,204,278,275,168,241,192,125,164,244,106,93,202,294,114,238,316,333,324,122,253,330,255,282,64,39,142,311,157,55,44,67,162,4,5,288,108,291,28,172,286,233,37,262,36,90,274,239,219,304,264,309,336,23,31,46,132,189,116,206,6,128,30,160,327,182,150,266,34,326,77,137,187,100,247,302,196,197,231,121,138,220,145,268,123,1,221,188,285,165,84,329,243,27,147,10,83,299,153,26,63,225,61,263,297,215,103,265,112,99,80,18,159,101,92,117,140","195,60,17,13,10,137,40,1,183,177,122,146,138","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
30,After working two years for the company she was burned out.,"Once upon a time, Amelia had eagerly joined a highly reputed firm right after her graduation. It was her dream job, a high energy position with a prestigious company known as Global Solutions Inc. With a sparkle in her eyes and unending determination, she had walked through its doors ready to change the world. The first few months were thrilling, full of challenges and learning opportunities. Every day was an adventure, every task a new challenge she was eager to tackle.

However, as weeks turned into months and months into years, the initial excitement began to fade. The company required her to clock in long hours, sacrificing her personal time and space. It was a relentless pursuit of targets and results. Her responsibilities seemed to be multiplying overnight, leaving her no time for her hobbies or even simple relaxation. All she remembered of her evenings were hurried dinners and catching up on reports before collapsing into bed.

This rigorous routine left her exhausted both mentally and physically. Day after day, her workload increased, her sleep decreased, and her stress levels shot through the roof. The constant pressure to perform had drained all the enthusiasm she once held for her job. Time that she used to spend on painting, traveling, and reading was now dedicated to working weekends and attending virtual meetings.

Over time, Amelia started to lose her zest for life. Her health deteriorated due to the constant work stress and lack of rest. Her social life became non-existent. No amount of coffee or energy drinks could sustain the energy she once had. Her characteristic vibrant smile slowly faded away, replaced by a perpetual look of exhaustion.

After two years of this intense pace, she reached her breaking point. One evening, after a particularly grueling workday, she stared at her weary reflection in the mirror. Dark circles under her eyes and a sallow complexion stared back at her. Realization dawned upon her - she was burned out. The job she once loved had sucked all the life out of her.

She was left with no choice but to prioritize her health and well-being. Making a tough decision, she quit her job, determined to regain her lost vigor and rediscover herself. Life was much more than work and corporate ladders. Amelia chose to take control of her life and not let the stress and constant work burn her out. She decided to embark on a new journey, away from the strenuous corporate life and towards a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.","90,126,115,124,63,72,254,172,102,219,32,301,266,74,1,308,20,5,316,288,160,338,101,150,28,167,312,257,234,25,106,151,162,246,323,200,107,15,9,84,11,217,146,69,229,299,240,243,109,325,113,31,125,29,294,336,92,285,171,253,38,22,56,14,183,91,97,192,269,227,153,223,45,128,293,278,194,144,165,43,76,208,295,303,4,319,188,214,218,271,148,222,225,2,206,252,220,37,302,205,80,297,255,177,95,141,120,49,71,263,232,228,187,58,103,296,26,83,270,317,272,131,130,211,33,23,215,244,236,104,159,210,250,280,273,249,237,54,135,190,21,265,67,18,279,189,41,140,231,260,77,0,320,327,19,212,224,251,328,48,256,178,185,100,198,289,292,53,201,287,290,27,64,57,176,117,333,168,155,24,318,332,193,154,309,7,305,239,181,127,242,262,175,50,119,152,36,298,197,122","144,155,17,141,62,126,180,30,117,172,25,54,52","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
31,He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.,"John had always been a man of challenges. Ever since his college days, he enjoyed pushing his limits, setting the bar high, and knocking it off with his sheer determination. This year, he decided to participate in the annual city marathon that had always been his dream. 

John had always been a casual runner but preparing for a marathon required much more than that. He sought the guidance of a professional coach and committed himself to a rigid training schedule. Every morning, he would wake up before dawn, put on his running shoes, and start his regime. In addition to physical training, he improved his diet, ensuring that he ate a balanced and healthy diet.

As the day of the marathon drew closer, John increased the intensity of his training. He started running longer and more challenging routes, always pushing himself a bit harder than the day before. His determination was unwavering, even though the demanding routine took a considerable toll on his body.

The long-awaited day finally arrived. The marathon commenced early in the morning, with the city streets filled with enthusiastic runners and cheering crowds. John was among the many participants, eager and geared up to conquer the race. He began his run with a surge of adrenaline, his heart pounding in his chest.

For the first few miles, John managed to keep a steady pace. He was focusing on his breathing and pacing, just as his coach had instructed. However, as the course became more challenging, John started to feel the strain. He was pushing himself to the limits, refusing to slow down.

After several grueling hours, John was nearing the finish line. Despite the burning sensation in his legs and shortness of breath, he refused to stop. When he crossed the finish line, a rush of accomplishment washed over him, followed by a wave of dizziness.

Just as the crowd cheered for him, his vision started to blur, and his legs gave out beneath him. He fell to the ground in slow motion, his body unable to carry him any further. People gasped as they saw John collapsing, and the medical staff was immediately called.

After completing his dream marathon, he had collapsed. His energy was completely drained, but a faint smile rested on his face. His marathon run had been a great personal accomplishment, albeit one that had pushed him to his extreme physical limits.","62,180,66,88,35,129,285,47,244,294,250,123,138,212,279,50,32,33,140,204,257,207,39,70,87,124,267,218,331,224,261,273,154,333,103,1,146,121,44,283,259,292,64,89,55,115,48,133,85,125,238,19,299,309,237,185,173,215,134,308,41,27,272,175,305,277,36,163,38,282,152,98,197,182,128,131,251,170,171,94,311,20,314,201,219,313,245,268,106,12,56,156,80,260,323,90,188,28,112,52,255,95,109,72,10,102,122,71,137,75,271,332,293,199,270,230,148,9,177,26,161,0,325,15,264,247,289,40,147,18,11,337,202,324,297,316,76,176,86,82,318,127,81,281,17,7,262,42,196,326,142,21,101,214,191,99,303,58,139,24,23,160,74,284,327,288,25,233,149,6,290,174,235,339,57,22,30,178,153,243,29,118,92,61,104,249,240,34,45,108,208,53,210,304,322,93,315,300,276,338","130,52,82,152,176,161,160,167,120,62,98,181,177","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Her job was anything but thrilling. In fact, it was downright mundane. Everyday, she found herself caught in the monotony of typing endless reports and attending seemingly pointless meetings.

""You may not like your job,"" her father had once told her, ""but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His words echoed in her mind now.

Helen was a numbers girl. She loved the challenge of solving complex problems. But her job left no room for creativity or problem-solving. 

Still, she remembered her father's warning. She began to wonder, was it worth risking the stability of a regular paycheck and the comfort of knowing exactly what each day held?

At lunch, her coworker Maria noticed her lack of enthusiasm. ""What's eating you, Helen?"" she asked. The two often shared a table in the noisy cafeteria, a brief respite from their tedious office routine. 

Helen confided in her friend. Maria was sympathetic but pragmatic. ""Look, it's not ideal, I get it, but the job pays the bills, right?""

Helen agreed, but she could not shake her discontentment. It was true that her job provided her with financial stability, but was that all life was about? 

She pondered on the subject for a few days. She mulled over her father's advice and Maria's sensible words. The idea of losing the job's security frightened her, but she felt a stronger pull towards pursuing something she truly loved.

She decided to start searching. Not to quit her job right away, but to have something to look forward to. A job where she could use her love for numbers in a creative way.

She spent her evenings scouring job boards, tweaking her resume, and sending out applications. Helen was diligent, but she also knew it was a gamble. 

The rejections came, plenty of them. She felt demoralized and questioned her decision. Yet, she remembered her father's advice and held onto her current job. 

Months passed. Eventually, Helen's determination paid off. An opportunity arose at a startup that needed someone with her knack for numbers and passion for problem-solving.

She accepted the job. On her last day at her old company, Helen looked around her old, dreary office. She felt a tinge of sadness for the routine she was leaving behind, but a spark of excitement for the adventure that awaited.

Her father's advice had guided her well. She did not like her job, but she had not quit merely on the hope of finding a better one. She had patiently waited, worked hard, and when the right opportunity came along, she took it. After all, hope without action is fruitless.","332,322,290,57,204,60,3,164,191,328,239,83,119,318,193,12,148,255,104,95,308,66,274,319,86,71,67,165,269,109,79,17,173,201,139,197,49,264,242,143,45,24,141,70,223,55,21,39,291,325,52,252,35,142,13,339,238,266,232,292,23,111,271,231,214,248,72,218,81,54,289,91,118,285,145,121,47,182,172,138,236,273,93,198,222,0,51,327,78,124,90,304,329,229,26,276,33,123,301,265,282,219,99,63,253,259,69,320,196,260,149,170,29,25,166,209,315,272,175,217,107,147,171,132,317,127,36,20,311,37,1,144,192,128,174,303,228,58,283,256,97,337,7,42,245,161,288,40,96,125,113,105,247,240,6,30,102,184,185,178,312,296,116,186,146,221,188,181,213,338,333,211,293,136,16,82,43,140,34,176,64,235,61,207,187,163,226,334,183,4,280,261,41,279,80,85,335,297,38,244","97,179,53,127,130,199,48,148,193,144,177","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
33,"He left his partner to find true love, only to realize that he already had it before.","Once upon a time in the bustling city of Chicago, there lived a man named Jack. Jack was a successful businessman, known for his sharp wit and charm. His partner of five years, Emily, a vivacious and nurturing woman, stood by his side, tirelessly supporting him in all his endeavors.

Jack and Emily were popular in their circle, seen as a perfect couple by their friends, family, and colleagues. They traveled the world together, explored different cuisines, and were also business partners. Jack, however, was restless. He harbored a doubt in the back of his mind, questioning if Emily was his true love or just a companion.

Attracted by the romantic stories of true love he heard from his friends and read in novels, Jack decided to leave Emily. He had a notion that there was more to love than he was experiencing. Emily was heartbroken but didn't obstruct Jack’s decision, hoping he would eventually realize his mistake.

Emboldened by a misguided notion of love, Jack threw himself into the dating pool. He went on dates, seeking that elusive spark that he thought was the mark of true love. He enjoyed the process, the thrill of meeting new people and experiencing different personalities.

Despite the parade of fascinating women he encountered, none could match up to Emily. Something was always missing. At first, he brushed it off, attributing it to high expectations or the unfamiliarity of new relationships.

Months turned into a year, and Jack still found himself alone. Each passing day made him more desperate and more disillusioned about love. There were several nights when he reminisced about Emily, about their shared laughter and comfortable silences. 

One day, he bumped into Emily at a party. She was still the same radiant woman he left, but the light in her eyes had dimmed. Seeing her stirred a whirlwind of emotions in him. Suddenly, all the doubts he harbored about their relationship seemed inconsequential.

In that moment, Jack realized he had left his partner in search of an idealized notion of true love. But true love wasn't about heart-racing excitement or a continuous string of romantic gestures. It was about finding someone who stood by him, supported him, and loved him for who he was.

With this newfound wisdom, Jack approached Emily. He confessed his mistake and admitted that he had already found his true love before he had left to find it. Jack realized that Emily, with all their shared history, understandings, and inside jokes, was his true love.

Emily, with a soft smile and a newfound glimmer in her eyes, forgave him. They rekindled their relationship, and Jack learned that true love often exists in the most ordinary places. He learned that one may search the world over only to find it sitting quietly back home, where it had always been.","34,255,138,199,223,56,21,186,85,116,310,46,129,240,59,188,41,156,225,215,286,16,238,135,269,2,232,165,333,290,268,0,43,113,42,178,61,164,131,206,118,101,175,124,237,207,53,117,132,210,50,281,326,159,40,339,123,75,3,204,30,228,67,295,148,319,140,200,8,36,51,167,313,335,189,82,330,304,262,312,111,218,146,301,62,71,142,230,5,246,181,183,231,49,45,217,168,256,294,18,23,92,48,179,127,195,332,68,311,90,325,292,293,93,216,251,80,106,32,208,270,202,277,338,150,120,249,78,84,102,212,147,289,4,331,162,73,160,234,11,305,314,201,258,194,276,144,171,299,161,323,110,211,306,58,288,318,121,141,72,239,137,35,224,243,39,317,283,143,37,57,76,192,166,296,173,122,184,29,103,193,149,70,99,198,321,197,267,174,91,248,158,220,205,278,104,172,126,264,38","119,1,163,70,170,200,166,55,17,35,33","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
34,Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.,"Once upon a time, in the small, quaint town of Lindale, lived a middle-aged couple named Greg and Martha. They were the owners of the town's only candy store, The Sweet Tooth. They were famous for their traditional, mouth-watering sweets that the town's people were accustomed to.

Every Friday, they would showcase their best confections from the window display, tempting all who passed by. Jars filled with colorful candies, creamy chocolate truffles, red cherry bonbons, and caramel chews lined the shelves. The whiff of sweetness would linger in the air, making the kids' eyes widen with delight. Even adults couldn't resist their yummy confections. 

One day, a new confectionery opened right across the street from The Sweet Tooth, named The Candy Craze. It was a flashy, modern candy store owned by a young entrepreneur named Jake. He was eager to introduce a new range of exotic sweets from around the world that might taste better than the usual ones.

Jake imported chocolates from Belgium, gummies from Germany, and hard candies from France. His store was vibrant and different. The locals were intrigued by the new tastes that Jake brought in. A lot of them were eager to try these new confections.

However, the old-timers, who had savored the treats from The Sweet Tooth for years, were skeptical. They were of the old-school thought - why change something that's already perfect? They thought it was better to buy the sweets they are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.

When Friday came, many of the locals rushed to The Candy Craze, driven by curiosity and the excitement of new flavors. Greg and Martha watched from across the street, worried that their loyal customers might abandon them. Despite this, they decided not to change their methods or products.

As the weeks went by, Jake's exotic candies did attract a lot of attention initially. However, people began to miss the familiar taste of sweets from The Sweet Tooth. They started realizing that they enjoyed the comfort brought by the traditional sweets more than the thrill of trying new ones.

The sense of nostalgia that Greg and Martha's sweets brought was unmatchable. Their caramels tasted like home, their chocolates felt like a warm hug, their bonbons carried the sweet memory of childhood. 

In the end, their belief in sticking to their old recipes proved successful. The people of Lindale learned a valuable lesson that day - sometimes, the familiarity of what you know and love can offer a comfort that no exotic novelty can replace. 

Thus, The Sweet Tooth flourished, proving that it was indeed better to buy the sweets one is accustomed to, than to try new ones that might taste better. Their traditional candies continued to spread joy, reminding everyone that sometimes, the best tastes are the ones you've always known.","54,70,116,133,141,119,315,31,134,251,125,282,255,71,55,228,149,78,104,236,126,172,266,32,11,101,22,333,111,184,110,338,317,148,98,19,59,97,259,293,123,92,196,15,160,127,215,170,248,17,209,108,193,73,128,146,3,107,6,331,173,328,201,67,232,51,118,35,62,112,323,164,156,295,81,199,246,131,337,43,74,197,294,79,276,208,300,247,136,205,191,174,48,120,147,13,139,299,80,318,218,186,202,114,4,336,301,47,5,254,284,159,229,223,264,140,45,273,287,42,41,326,220,319,153,154,286,310,324,76,249,25,66,87,245,214,29,252,225,137,56,217,307,85,263,33,242,231,253,313,203,37,212,40,44,161,303,233,304,12,20,237,175,227,187,171,94,211,1,339,65,314,200,36,321,267,166,163,260,117,132,151,39,327,181,188,305,38,221,278,86,235,152,335,57,329,296,210,10,102","24,146,68,174,152,188,183,154,121,120,80","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
35,I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.,"In the small town where I grew up, cooking wasn't just a chore or a hobby, but a tradition. It was like a heartbeat that kept the town and its people alive, a shared rhythm that connected us all. In my family, recipes were passed down from generation to generation, each adding their personal touch but adhering to the tradition.

One artifact that symbolized this tradition was my old cooking pan. That pan had seen numerous family dinners, Sunday brunches, and even the odd midnight snack. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that the pan was a silent witness to the lives and times of my family.

One day, while visiting the local market, I came across a shiny new utensil. It boasted a plethora of fancy features. It could regulate its heat, had a non-stick surface, and was even dishwasher-friendly. It caught my attention, and I found myself attracted to the modernity it represented.

However, as I held the new utensil in my hands, my mind began to wander back to my old pan. It was nothing like this new-age gadget. It was simple, perhaps even a little worn out, but it was filled with memories. I remembered how my grandmother used it to teach me her secret recipes, how my mother used it to cook my favorite meals, and how I had used it to cook my first successful dish.

Something in me stirred as I thought of replacing my old pan with this impersonal, high-tech utensil. I realized that the new pan, with all its fancy features, could never replace the value of my old one. It was not about the convenience or efficiency the new pan offered, it was about the connection my old pan had with my family, our heritage, and tradition.

I put down the new utensil, leaving it on the market shelf. I realized I didn't need a pan with fancy features. I just needed my old pan, with all its history and sentiment. I returned home, happy with my decision. That night, I cooked dinner using my old pan, feeling more connected to my roots than ever before.

Using my old pan for cooking, rather than buying a new utensil with fancy features, wasn't just about nostalgia. It was about honoring my family tradition, preserving memories, and respecting the stories that had been cooked into its seasoned surface. 

In the end, it is not about how shiny or technologically advanced a tool is. The value lies in the stories it tells, the memories it holds, and the traditions it helps to keep alive. And that's something no new utensil with fancy features could ever provide.","42,71,213,260,50,34,261,13,334,31,106,307,333,297,329,20,202,211,238,40,150,265,144,173,237,145,251,78,135,68,52,184,163,224,182,115,197,318,306,156,283,17,331,66,4,322,233,137,157,177,212,290,267,284,21,79,18,113,122,295,164,330,43,309,76,62,9,111,264,186,142,74,166,312,36,152,136,200,132,296,241,82,118,61,84,39,247,188,70,256,172,315,98,262,67,55,32,167,170,46,327,8,33,193,198,278,99,314,95,291,90,7,44,93,107,222,103,336,10,117,210,119,168,64,311,72,208,271,129,88,218,41,228,268,215,26,169,195,324,75,101,11,244,2,45,266,102,138,147,316,124,339,37,86,231,104,242,178,1,219,209,183,293,123,148,287,53,180,83,181,281,165,305,286,105,114,323,19,249,23,81,85,140,171,38,151,139,298,277,54,185,273,143,176,59,63,16,187,51,236","97,103,6,75,153,185,86,20,132,1,63","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
36,Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.,"It was a frosty winter afternoon; the air was biting, and everything around us was white. My friends and I were huddled in our jackets and scarves, teeth chattering from the chilly air. One of my friends, Jeff, turned to us, rubbing his hands together and said, ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.""

With that, we decided to set up camp right there, in the middle of the snowy wilderness. We divided tasks; some went to gather firewood while others started to clear a space for the fire. The snow beneath our feet crunched as we trudged through, searching for dry twigs and branches. Despite the bitter cold, there was a certain excitement and adrenaline rush in our spirits.

As we began clearing the area, Mike, the strongest among us, dug into the snow, creating a pit to shield the fire from the wind. Sarah and Jenny, the most organized, started setting up our makeshift kitchen. They brought out our portable stove, coffee, and canned beans that we had brought with us. The sight of food warmed our hearts amidst the bitter cold.

Soon enough, we had gathered enough firewood. Jeff, our fire expert, laid out the wood strategically and struck a match against the box. There was a brief spark before a steady flame sprung up, gradually spreading to the wood, creating a warm glow. The immediate warmth of the fire caused a collective sigh of relief as it brushed against our cold, numb faces.

We huddled around the fire, soaking in its heat, as laughter and chatter filled the air. Sarah and Jenny started heating up the beans on the portable stove, and the smell of food wafted through the air. We watched as the coffee boiled over the fire, the scent wrapping us in a comforting embrace. 

Hours passed by, stories were shared, and laughter echoed in the wilderness. The cold no longer seemed daunting but had become a part of our adventure. We watched as the snowflakes fell gently around us, reflecting the fire's glow. We were lost in a winter wonderland that was ours and ours alone.

It was as if the world had stopped, and it was just us, our friendship, and this unforgettable moment. Looking back, Jeff's idea of making do with the cold and building a fire turned out to be one of the best decisions we had made on this trip. The cold that had once seemed unbearable now reminded us of the warmth of togetherness and the power of adaptability.

When we finally packed up and left, we took away with us not only the memories of that day but also a valuable lesson — instead of waiting for circumstances to change, we have the power to adapt and make the most of the situation at hand. And sometimes, in doing so, we end up creating some of the most unforgettable moments of our lives.","172,199,293,53,248,309,196,124,41,135,66,240,235,20,330,76,300,149,35,125,12,221,246,21,141,289,37,96,339,150,120,280,226,38,260,148,265,233,5,156,274,228,174,34,333,195,136,323,143,106,180,101,234,142,315,275,249,331,163,116,100,146,82,97,14,47,218,19,305,92,65,239,69,25,302,45,270,167,32,98,215,277,319,16,49,205,325,204,334,46,306,112,329,52,258,157,42,151,110,190,133,6,219,68,292,134,276,191,321,2,332,327,197,224,105,192,15,126,84,161,294,322,51,94,185,123,64,225,231,278,313,198,298,40,85,335,254,58,238,262,336,91,86,72,23,279,263,165,1,245,171,43,4,170,273,33,147,175,80,22,73,177,220,48,31,118,267,28,128,286,93,39,131,61,111,176,272,29,203,186,10,213,169,162,184,103,75,83,102,295,281,164,282,0,121,337,223,244,314,138","79,156,44,19,27,34,172,134,9,97,152","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
37,"Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.","A little girl named Lily had a small patch of garden that she deeply loved. Every day, she would tend to the little space, nurturing every plant and flower with utmost care. She had a variety of plants in her garden - roses, daisies, tulips, and some vegetables too. Gardening was not only her hobby but also her sanctuary, her source of solace and peace.

One afternoon, as Lily was watering her plants, her grandpa Henry watched her from the porch. He had taught her everything she knew about gardening and was always proud of her dedication. Sensing an opportunity to impart more knowledge, he called out to Lily.

""Lily,"" he said, ""remember, even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.""

Lily paused and frowned a little. ""But grandpa, won't the rain be enough? I don't want to overwater them,"" she replied. However, grandpa Henry simply chuckled and settled more comfortably into his rocking chair.

""You see, Lily,"" he began, ""rain is a crucial part of gardening. Yes, it nourishes our plants with the water it provides. However, relying only on the rain means neglecting your garden when it’s not there.""

He explained further, ""Rainwater is beneficial, but it doesn't always distribute evenly across the garden. Some plants may get too much, while others may get too little. Also, remember that every plant is unique. They have different needs, including the amount of water they require.""

Grandpa Henry pointed towards the newly planted tomatoes. ""For example,"" he continued, ""tomatoes need consistent watering. If they don't get enough water, their growth can be hampered. And when it suddenly rains after a dry spell, the tomatoes can crack or split.""

He went on to stress the importance of the gardener's role in maintaining the health of the garden. ""Apart from watering, checking on the plants, pruning them, removing weeds, all these are essential garden tasks that should not be ignored.""

Lily listened to her grandfather's advice attentively, etching every word into her mind. From then on, she made sure to water her garden even when rain was forecasted. She quickly found out that grandpa Henry was right.

On days when the rain was too scarce or too heavy, her garden managed to remain vibrant and healthy thanks to her efforts. Her roses bloomed brighter, her daisies grew taller, and her vegetables were bountiful. And every time she watered her garden despite the forecast, she thought of her grandpa's advice and smiled. 

Indeed, a gardener's diligence could never be replaced by Mother Nature's whims.","20,248,5,265,332,293,108,325,194,23,64,274,249,261,110,321,135,328,317,65,197,10,89,337,200,40,193,316,149,54,286,41,335,220,284,290,142,99,231,333,133,280,173,30,191,58,295,309,178,155,4,278,302,240,21,105,7,35,258,318,104,42,283,219,154,152,230,269,26,102,119,310,146,34,72,271,326,264,277,297,315,266,100,60,238,233,86,324,305,138,294,29,268,137,228,260,189,57,215,111,217,12,272,263,107,153,210,117,172,62,180,76,330,134,254,259,6,51,25,195,299,227,15,164,14,273,43,239,199,82,97,190,0,73,125,112,75,292,237,250,39,127,3,84,308,49,151,188,31,36,145,59,95,204,319,139,85,87,168,11,281,170,225,157,129,38,175,303,53,221,247,81,46,306,16,150,253,296,159,246,79,313,206,289,122,311,50,92,323,90,166,32,91,179,33,115,282,18,187,148","192,195,74,58,150,166,141,26,32,62,127","1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
38,"Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.","On a bright, beautiful Sunday morning, Emily's mother reminded her, ""Make sure you take an umbrella - I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry."" Emily, preparing to go out with her friends for the day, gave her mother a quizzical look. To her, taking an umbrella in such fine weather seemed nonsensical. The sky was as blue as the ocean, with no visible signs of rain.

She retorted sarcastically, ""Sure, mom, and I'll take my swimsuit too, in case it snows."" Her mother just smiled knowingly and returned to the book she was engrossed in.

With her bag packed, Emily embarked on the journey to her friend Tom's house. The sun beat down hot on her back, making her wish she had listened to her mother and carried an umbrella for some shade. Even the weather app on her phone had been unequivocal in its forecast for the day, predicting sunshine with no chance of precipitation.

When Emily arrived at Tom's place, she was greeted by a chorus of laughter as she expressed her mother's advice about carrying an umbrella. Her friends were incredulous, finding it amusing that anyone could expect rain on such a radiant day.

The group decided to head out to the park for a picnic. They frolicked in the lush grass and played frisbee under the heat of the sun. The summer breeze whistled past their ears as they enjoyed their sandwiches and lemonade.

As the day drifted lazily on, white, fluffy clouds started to gather in the sky above. Slowly, they darkened, transforming from white to an ominous shade of grey. Emily's heart sank; her mother's words came rushing back to her. The wind picked up, and the once-clear sky was now a shroud of thick, menacing clouds.

The first few droplets of rain splattered down on the ground. A collective gasp ran through the group. Emily felt a tinge of embarrassment tingling in her cheeks. She had chosen to ignore her mother's sage advice and had been proven wrong.

With the rain intensifying, Emily and her friends had to abandon their picnic and scramble for shelter. By the time they found cover under a park gazebo, they were already drenched. As they waited for the rain to stop, Emily wished she had followed her mother's wise words. She promised herself to be prepared in the future, rain or shine.

Turning a rueful face towards the sky, Emily muttered to herself, ""Better safe than sorry, indeed."" It was a lesson she would carry with her, a reminder that even the sunniest of days could be fraught with unexpected showers. It had taken a downpour to drive home the truth of her mother's advice, a lesson learned the wet way.","330,304,34,338,291,94,24,27,189,162,35,143,103,119,296,316,234,111,141,194,105,215,277,290,37,299,226,117,331,127,339,218,302,25,256,101,109,206,12,313,169,178,259,168,211,79,153,46,26,272,283,3,55,266,92,56,97,150,312,36,89,65,33,15,128,284,219,305,276,88,129,197,335,224,190,139,163,311,179,6,332,40,147,243,2,275,104,161,146,207,213,0,320,301,309,306,13,209,77,82,63,87,74,83,230,18,124,182,262,134,66,78,131,205,204,69,298,135,11,289,293,220,54,233,118,187,43,167,32,323,325,1,337,164,280,184,242,61,7,144,81,80,208,136,138,121,250,20,177,48,258,151,269,64,99,172,166,170,261,171,73,142,255,253,148,225,30,41,238,39,221,281,324,42,174,158,71,93,137,108,217,232,53,154,183,249,149,8,198,246,10,210,86,228,47,308,252,120,200,98","129,63,3,11,60,25,170,82,168,174,127","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
39,"To avoid burning your hands, use oven mitts when removing the cake, as it will be hot unlike how it is now.","Once upon a time, in the bustling town of Sweetsville, there lived an eccentric baker named Margery. Margery was known far and wide for her delectable baked treats, but her cakes were especially beloved. They were fluffy, moist, and filled with delightful flavors that would fill the air and attract people from miles around. 

One sunny afternoon, Margery was in her cozy kitchen, preparing one of her famous chocolate cakes for an upcoming town festival. She carefully measured each ingredient, mixed them, and poured the luscious batter into a large round pan. She preheated her oven and lovingly slid the cake inside, anticipation building within her.

As the cake started to bake, a heavenly scent filled her home. The tantalizing aroma wafted out of the windows, and soon a small crowd of children had gathered outside, their noses in the air. Margery chuckled, a feeling of satisfaction blooming within her. 

Meanwhile, the cake was slowly transforming inside the oven, gaining a rich brown hue and rising to perfection. As the minutes ticked by, the cake got hotter and hotter, unlike the cool room temperature batter it had once been.

Knowing that the cake would be too hot to handle, Margery fetched her oven mitts, carefully slipped them on, and made her way to the oven. It was a safety measure she'd learned the hard way years ago after a painful burn. Now she wouldn't risk handling anything out of the oven without them.

She reached for the oven door, feeling the heat emanating even through the insulated mitts. As she opened the door, a blast of warm, sweet-smelling air greeted her. The sight of the perfectly risen, scrumptious cake made her heart swell with pride.

With a firm grip, she carefully slid the rack out and hoisted the cake pan onto the countertop. Her hands, shielded by the mitts, were safe from the scorching pan. The cake, still bubbling and sizzling, was as hot as predicted. But thanks to her oven mitts, Margery’s hands were secure.

Watching the cake cool down and the children outside, who were growing impatient by the second, she couldn't help but laugh. Not too long ago, the cake was merely a mix of ingredients. It had been cool and uninteresting. But now, it was a piping hot masterpiece, attracting attention from all around.

So there it was, an important lesson repeated. When handling anything hot, especially fresh out of the oven, using oven mitts was necessary to avoid any burns. And this golden rule allowed Margery to continually create her baking magic for all to enjoy, without suffering any damage herself.","108,72,222,152,37,307,165,4,105,322,215,116,314,280,80,53,15,0,160,111,178,57,157,220,283,289,229,217,27,35,323,335,51,70,31,96,90,189,219,127,128,148,331,75,143,287,298,221,274,175,137,179,40,332,303,176,36,277,272,119,95,197,267,83,166,61,122,19,192,11,232,121,88,261,266,79,32,223,279,297,198,181,258,164,159,210,226,34,125,18,8,120,199,201,76,129,49,242,47,155,33,28,13,247,73,194,6,260,241,78,254,236,140,336,235,185,213,82,115,204,337,319,186,106,228,306,123,158,38,93,168,308,41,67,339,203,74,141,109,288,273,135,130,86,177,211,29,212,117,206,23,24,17,92,25,328,268,60,170,133,44,227,183,325,161,281,144,246,85,68,269,309,81,255,180,329,316,163,52,253,64,182,275,243,56,14,10,238,292,43,136,338,318,20,5,304,184,99,22,42","77,101,88,30,57,5,129,53,133,200,190","1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
40,"It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.","In the heart of December, it was a surprisingly mild day. It was not as cold as I'd expected, somewhat defeating the purpose of my heavily layered clothing. In fact, I might have even ventured to call it a pleasant winter day. Yet, despite the forgiving weather, I decided I would still drive to work.

You see, normally, I'd enjoy the walk. It's a little more than a couple of blocks, but I like the briskness of the morning, the sight of the sleepy city slowly awakening. It's a ritual that I've come to love. The rhythm of my shoes on the pavement, the cool air kissing my cheeks, the familiar route providing comforting predictability. However, today was different. I couldn't afford to get sick, not now.

I had the largest presentation of my career scheduled for the following week. Every higher-up in the company would be present, and I'd been working tirelessly for weeks to ensure I was ready. A performance like this could easily make or break my career; it was a stepping stone to my much-desired promotion. A sneaky cold, or worse, the flu, would not just be a mere inconvenience.

I had been meticulous in every other preparation. The slides were well-designed, the speech was practiced, and the suit was pressed. But as we all know, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Something as uncontrollable as the weather could throw me off balance and seriously impact my work.

I wasn’t going to take any chances. I had seen colleagues fall victim to cold weather sickness before, knocked out of commission for days, sometimes even weeks. Sure, I had taken the flu shot, but those weren’t full-proof. They couldn’t protect against all strains.

Therefore, despite the not-so-chilly temperature today, I decided on the safer route. I decided to drive to work. My tiny, old car may not have been the most glamorous vehicle on the road, but it had a heater. It kept me warm. It was reliable. 

So, I threw on my coat, grabbed my car keys, and headed out the door. As I drove, the windows fogged up from the warm air inside the car contrasting with the colder outside temperature. The city streets rolled by outside, the buildings and pedestrians a blur as I passed.

It may have seemed a bit paranoid, an over-precaution for a day that wasn’t all that cold. But to me, it was the wisest decision. After all, you can’t put a price on health, or success.","286,303,106,295,166,175,61,297,8,4,180,158,32,322,309,91,233,313,239,185,262,42,191,296,284,290,306,146,316,57,327,163,48,117,128,138,225,280,169,104,170,99,145,109,332,293,31,64,237,95,213,224,329,7,337,56,176,172,137,231,177,168,36,5,272,187,23,300,268,140,222,160,30,203,6,201,202,85,234,254,151,321,74,149,38,93,264,73,279,139,35,126,186,53,178,291,206,243,70,328,47,253,116,182,227,103,150,45,68,198,114,265,238,12,0,152,285,232,247,13,19,307,162,94,46,248,276,157,266,235,136,190,121,76,292,167,333,51,338,105,209,22,181,2,226,58,37,39,80,240,41,24,310,259,135,274,236,195,223,288,82,298,299,44,214,119,315,283,84,79,50,200,14,188,230,15,217,34,155,244,260,278,331,301,132,71,69,33,43,164,184,112,318,192,323,336,269,256,18,277","13,188,178,91,63,147,85,148,151,22,189","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
41,"Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you as if you negotiate too much they might take the offer back.","Once upon a time, in a land steeped in magic and mystery, there lived a young boy named Oliver. He was known far and wide for his cunning, his bravery, and his insatiable curiosity. However, Oliver had one trait that had always caused him trouble: his uncontrolled greed.

One day, an opportunity of a lifetime was presented to him. A band of mysterious traders from a distant land came to his village. They were in search of someone who could retrieve a priceless artifact, the Star of Amana, which was said to hold immense power. Seeing this as a chance to earn glory and riches, Oliver stepped forward, despite his elders’ warning.

""Don't be greedy, Oliver. Just take whatever they offer you. If you negotiate too much, they might take the offer back,"" his wise old grandmother cautioned. She had seen enough in her long life to know the perils of greed.

However, the young lad, brimming with overconfidence, did not heed his grandmother's advice. Instead, he boldly approached the traders, declaring he would only retrieve the Star of Amana if rewarded with half the wealth of their land. 

The traders exchanged glances and replied, ""We can give you much gold and jewels, but we can't promise half our wealth.""

This wasn't enough for Oliver. ""You'll get nothing if you don't meet my demand,"" he retorted, making his position very clear.

Silence echoed through the village square. Then one trader, the eldest amongst them, stood up. His voice was calm, but his eyes held a stern warning. ""Young man, your greed does not impress us. Perhaps you're not the one we're looking for.""

The villagers gasped, and Oliver could feel his face turning pale. He had expected them to succumb to his demands, not retract the offer altogether. Looking at their stony faces, he realized the gravity of his mistake.

He fell to his knees, shame washing over him, and apologized profusely. ""I'm sorry for my greed. I was wrong. Please, give me a chance to make it right.""

The old trader looked at the humbled boy. ""We'll think on it,"" he said, leading his team away. As the villagers dispersed, Oliver remained in the square, filled with regret and fear. He had let his greed cloud his judgment and now, he could only hope that the traders would give him another chance.","150,158,38,193,269,103,113,307,34,64,40,75,222,165,209,51,80,203,131,330,37,159,308,141,134,251,232,311,273,39,171,110,192,18,310,25,275,139,68,130,123,318,167,136,316,4,191,46,291,138,52,21,177,63,147,185,94,325,324,122,194,216,70,86,199,245,179,227,104,280,293,230,264,6,326,263,329,36,129,79,95,61,91,9,186,78,82,278,126,118,35,323,207,234,169,47,252,143,261,20,218,226,2,84,187,303,33,188,306,249,32,99,54,289,197,250,309,236,44,224,101,175,240,223,237,140,334,107,153,172,255,162,339,304,181,29,148,105,332,71,7,219,333,272,254,328,124,173,231,121,180,53,100,59,146,315,109,56,302,246,300,81,93,319,204,176,83,215,49,279,294,3,42,295,114,243,74,290,184,157,87,135,11,285,190,282,225,10,229,268,127,260,60,152,265,43,154,132,258,85","111,107,9,91,78,21,3,30,11,173,196","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
42,"Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.","I've always been an outdoor enthusiast, having spent most of my youth exploring every corner of the woods surrounding our family home. My father introduced me to these woods, a place he had wandered extensively himself as a youngster. Over time, I became well acquainted with its paths, turns, and secret spots, almost as if the wood itself was my intimate friend. Although I was pretty familiar with this part of the woods and didn't really need a map, I still brought one with me on this particular day.

It was a sunny day, perfect for a long hike. The morning air held a slight chill as I headed out, but with the promise of warm, golden sunshine to come. I had my backpack on, filled with essentials: water, some granola bars, a first-aid kit, and that potentially unnecessary map. Its presence was a little unusual for me, but today felt different.

Walking along the familiar trail, I admired the massive oak trees, their branches casting a lacework of shadows over the path. I could hear the birds chirping their morning songs and leaves rustling underfoot. Yet, despite the familiar comfort, I felt a sense of unease creeping in.

The forest, which I typically navigated with an almost uncanny instinct, was a bit stranger to me that day. Unusual sounds caught my attention, the flutter of wings seemed louder, and the whispers of leaves felt eerier. It was as if the forest was speaking in a language I no longer understood.

As the day wore on, I realized I'd ventured further than my usual route. The path twisted and turned in ways I didn't recognize, leading me deeper into the woods. I came across a peculiar old tree I didn't recall seeing before. It stood there, gnarled and twisted, and I couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling it gave me.

It was then that I felt it- the twist in my stomach, the sinking realization of being lost. I had somehow lost track of the trail. For the first time in my countless hikes, I had ventured too far off the beaten path and found myself in unfamiliar territory.

Desperate, I reached for the map I had so casually thrown into my bag. I thanked my instincts, even as I chastised myself for not heeding the map earlier. As I unfolded it, I tried to align the lines and contours on the paper with my surroundings.

I used the map to retrace my steps, working my way back to familiar territory, feeling a measure of relief. The journey back was fraught with anxiety, but the map guided me like a trusty companion.

In the end, that supposedly unnecessary map became my savior. It was a stark reminder that even in familiar territories, being prepared is always a good idea. It taught me that the wilderness, however well-known, always held unpredictable variables. I resolved always to carry a map with me in the future, no matter how well I believed I knew the route.","290,308,82,155,62,177,295,36,325,97,331,210,111,47,11,239,193,20,30,168,299,214,69,114,164,304,293,233,40,196,220,212,100,163,213,6,160,206,337,10,227,137,322,99,260,55,217,50,65,261,335,246,296,3,209,37,276,81,207,78,326,151,46,79,34,29,135,93,92,138,240,187,32,73,169,313,80,218,106,267,216,294,270,77,201,180,330,166,339,4,1,43,320,98,222,54,49,146,23,300,71,88,121,219,235,116,89,279,208,184,2,306,104,173,211,109,198,280,39,175,28,301,200,221,53,286,86,162,41,269,148,178,7,35,291,205,292,258,56,305,245,161,87,336,102,252,287,281,144,149,253,311,85,282,156,15,238,38,174,242,307,18,128,181,147,236,338,272,229,328,91,8,248,314,115,33,107,140,66,297,192,275,318,122,130,273,256,64,268,158,241,319,123,110,75,329,283,165,265,67","73,176,65,134,8,56,158,119,29,129,92","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
43,Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.,"In a small town lived a man named John. John was known for his meticulous habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his routine before going to bed. John always made sure to keep a jug full of water near his bedside table. The reason was simple; he often woke up in the middle of the night with an unquenchable thirst.

John had noticed this phenomenon of late-night thirst ever since he was a teenager. When he first experienced it, he would get up, groggy and frustrated, and walk all the way to the kitchen for a glass of water. However, one night, he tripped over the family dog in the dark and had a painful fall. That was the moment he decided to keep water within arm's reach when he slept.

He started with a simple glass of water, but sometimes he would knock it over in his sleep. The cold water would splash on him, jolting him awake in the middle of the night. He quickly realized that he needed a better solution, and that's when he decided upon the idea of the jug.

A sturdy jug was less likely to tip over. He would fill it up with fresh, cool water every night before bedtime. It would sit in its usual spot on the nightstand, waiting for the moment when John's parched throat would beckon. That small jug was a beacon of relief, glowing faintly in the moonlight that streamed through John's window.

As he climbed into bed each night, the reassuring silhouette of the jug was always the last thing John saw before drifting off into sleep. The jug was his silent companion in the stillness of the night, always prepared to quench his thirst.

On the rare occasion that John woke up without feeling thirsty, he would still feel a sense of comfort at the sight of the jug on the table. The jug was a constant, a part of his nighttime routine that had become deeply ingrained in him. It was more than just a vessel for water; it was a symbol of preparedness, of John's ability to anticipate his needs and provide for them.

Years passed and John moved to different houses, but the jug full of water by his bedside table remained a staple. Every night, without fail, he would fill up the jug and place it near his bed. This habit had become such an integral part of John's life that he wouldn't be able to sleep without the jug on the table. And so, the advice he'd give to anyone who would listen was this: ""Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.""","114,116,73,333,184,174,274,9,238,298,91,272,126,319,50,146,170,228,82,277,32,270,268,104,6,217,119,220,198,203,113,167,335,237,246,173,179,240,261,65,308,33,233,127,191,31,326,297,21,321,84,182,192,136,265,34,162,329,223,149,275,26,100,330,306,232,44,25,163,7,38,236,281,18,286,264,300,139,251,19,60,63,12,288,262,125,234,72,200,93,36,83,323,101,289,131,207,159,8,130,309,156,39,202,61,69,37,55,206,276,303,190,293,134,257,14,287,316,74,66,0,90,164,304,181,78,160,244,331,76,56,142,13,88,183,53,197,108,71,318,259,58,337,166,214,16,67,267,92,177,150,105,239,35,52,320,339,118,98,42,210,86,332,87,40,205,178,23,41,258,155,314,322,161,165,22,107,5,122,128,85,143,51,249,269,271,59,193,294,176,315,103,94,252,295,310,79,263,231,129","21,42,56,154,91,107,71,103,165,169,160","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
44,"In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.","Sitting in the dimly lit office, Jack leaned back in his chair with a deep sigh. He glanced at his wristwatch - it was just past midnight. Rubbing his tired eyes, he looked over at his work partner, Sarah, who sat across from him typing frantically on her laptop. A heavy, exhausted atmosphere enveloped the room. Jack sighed again, ""In for a penny, in for a pound,"" he muttered.

Sarah looked up from her screen, her glasses slipping down her nose due to the weight of exhaustion. ""What was that?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jack shook his head, flicking a crumbled sheet of paper from the edge of the desk. ""I said, 'In for a penny, in for a pound'. We're too deep into this now. We need to stay up all night and get this report done. We cannot turn it in half-finished.""

Sarah nodded in agreement, her attention returning to the screen of her laptop. The words began to blur as the two found themselves wrestling with the data at hand, engaged in a silent battle with sleep.

Coffee cups accumulated on the desk as the hours waned on. The mellow glow from the desk lamp cast long shadows on their tired faces. Sarah's constant typing was the only sound piercing the silence of the night. 

Suddenly, Jack hit a stroke of inspiration. Grabbing his notebook, he jotted down several points, ideas for graphs and analysis. Sarah glanced over, curiosity piqued by the sudden rush of enthusiasm. They worked together, refining ideas and double-checking figures. Their collaborative spirit lifted the oppressive quietude of the room.

As the first light of dawn began to peek through the blinds, they stared at their creation with bleary-eyed satisfaction. Pages upon pages of well-researched facts and figures, complex graphs, and detailed analysis sprawled across their desk. They had done it, despite the initial doubt and the tiredness pulling at their eyelids.

With a shared glance of tired triumph, they printed the final copy of their report, the printer's hum serving as a victory song in the quiet office. Submitting it to their boss' desk, they left the office just as the world began to wake.

For Jack and Sarah, 'In for a penny, in for a pound' was more than a proverbial saying. It was a testament to their dedication and unwavering determination to complete a task, no matter the odds stacked against them, no matter the sleepless night. It became their motto, a badge they wore with pride, instilling in them a resilience that future projects would undoubtedly demand.","197,28,181,50,305,57,184,319,230,39,290,189,132,301,163,191,178,71,108,143,37,317,218,136,162,228,26,312,192,215,131,337,56,182,119,118,46,237,303,170,254,329,198,124,309,294,331,94,88,248,33,333,242,267,278,61,338,38,292,139,110,100,9,174,150,158,15,260,76,52,227,286,36,47,18,64,190,103,323,72,171,2,255,125,121,155,289,194,23,41,1,42,288,144,268,45,12,84,89,298,304,20,257,31,185,235,24,339,269,74,129,180,169,17,207,232,202,16,219,126,263,224,259,149,53,8,29,134,30,112,115,138,187,62,243,92,203,4,213,209,310,51,95,117,48,55,241,164,250,11,165,205,128,284,307,272,54,280,271,49,229,43,86,201,141,313,322,231,308,327,93,220,157,186,249,166,277,193,96,159,142,258,99,177,91,336,226,328,34,176,122,66,154,270,140,111,105,77,106,90","96,37,74,145,160,4,142,70,125,157,146","1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
45,I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.,"After months of endless brainstorming, discussions, and evaluations, I came to a significant decision. I decided to see the project through, to not back down. I made a promise to myself that I would do anything to get the work done. It was not just about completing it; it was about proving to myself that I could succeed, that I had the strength and perseverance to accomplish something this complex.

The project was a construction venture; we aimed to convert an old warehouse into a luxury apartment complex. It was a bold and ambitious endeavor, and from the beginning, it was riddled with obstacles and setbacks. We encountered every hurdle imaginable, from planning permission issues to disputes with contractors, even financial constraints. Every day posed a new challenge, a fresh battle to overcome.

I was the project manager, the one who carried the weight of everyone’s expectations. I was the go-to guy, the one whom everyone looked to when things went wrong, and boy, did things go wrong. A lot. Each setback seemed to sap my energy, each hurdle seemed to push me closer to the edge of surrender. Many nights, I considered walking away, giving up, and leaving it all behind. But each morning, I picked up where I left off, fuelled by determination and cups of strong coffee.

The day I decided to stick with it, I felt an overwhelming sense of resolve. I remember sitting in my office, staring at the blueprints spread across my desk. They represented so much more than a construction project. They embodied a dream, a vision of what could be. They were a concrete manifestation of my determination and grit. I knew then, with a certainty that surprised even me, that I was not going to abandon this.

My decision was met with surprise and relief by my team. They had seen my resolve waver in the face of adversity, had witnessed my discouragement when things didn't go as planned. But now, they saw a renewed energy in me, a firm resolve that seemed unshakeable. There was a visible shift in our dynamic; we went from a group of individuals to a cohesive team, united in our common goal.

The following weeks were filled with hard work and progress. Brick by brick, floor by floor, we saw our vision come to life. It was gruelling work, yet deeply satisfying. With each setback we overcame, we felt our belief grow stronger, our resolve deeper.

My decision to see the project through and do anything to get the work done changed everything. It was not just about the project's completion. It was about proving to myself, and to my team, that we had the strength, determination, and resilience to overcome any challenge that came our way. And we did, brick by brick, step by step, until we stood before our completed project. I had made my decision, and we had seen it through to the end.","158,194,224,337,58,97,120,234,292,207,212,214,156,307,154,93,94,201,101,121,235,219,48,142,183,291,55,31,4,6,38,174,216,161,123,198,160,205,74,92,52,88,269,265,0,335,196,311,16,303,90,263,148,102,313,30,26,323,329,192,27,204,5,136,241,189,319,262,260,56,42,51,255,257,53,141,140,49,46,116,299,114,202,252,193,309,186,151,169,96,143,145,76,28,308,249,14,12,191,146,47,33,91,126,69,61,80,184,109,228,25,203,83,163,21,297,190,149,81,288,176,9,162,298,188,115,150,54,296,270,244,40,211,177,266,300,248,134,264,98,44,185,221,293,2,187,330,7,89,218,106,278,315,213,155,246,321,50,8,312,32,314,24,133,18,37,132,275,70,144,71,175,122,271,139,209,326,230,256,75,277,232,77,165,279,220,170,10,178,338,238,111,152,276,128,68,332,289,333,206","141,79,101,23,78,158,72,41,75,128,27","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
46,"After the team’s defeat last season, they fired their manager and have decided to give it their all to win the title this season.","Last season, the Lionhearts Football Club had endured a crushing defeat. It was a devastating blow to them, as they had trained exhaustively and put in the effort to win the championship title. The cold bitter defeat was something they had to taste though. Unfortunately, fingers were pointed, blame was placed, and it fell heavily on the team manager.

The owner of the club, Mr. Wilson, was a man who valued victory. Seeing his beloved team wallowing in defeat led him to make a drastic decision. He decided to fire the manager, who had led them for three years. His leadership was put into question after they had come out bottom of the league. After all, the team had invested a lot in the best training facilities, top-notch equipment, and renowned coaches. The problem, Wilson concluded, was the management.

The decision to fire the manager was a bitter pill to swallow for the team. They had been through thick and thin together. Yet, they knew something had to change. They had to adopt a new mentality, a new strategy, and a new objective for the upcoming season. They needed a fresh start and a different direction.

Determined to turn their unfortunate fate around, they decided to give it their all to win the title this season. They wanted to prove that they were not defeated, only delayed. This became their battle cry, a slogan that reinvigorated their spirits. The commitment was shared by each player, coach, and staff in the club.

A new manager was hired. She was a rising star in the football industry, known for her innovative strategies and winning mentality. As soon as she stepped foot in the club, she announced her first order of business, ""We need to learn from our past, but not dwell in it. Let's move forward and keep our eyes on the prize.""

She brought in new training regimens, new strategies, and even recruited a few rising talents. Slowly but surely, the club started to exhibit changes. The team started to embody a fresh spirit, a grit that was missing before. Practice sessions became more intensive, and the players' competitive spirit was reignited.

As the new season began, it was evident the Lionhearts were different. Their energy, their resilience, and their determination was palpable. The first match was a victory, an electrifying win that set the tone for the rest of the season. This was not the same team that had tasted defeat the last season; this was a team hungry for victory.

All the while, the fired manager observed from a distance. Despite the bitterness of being let go, he found himself cheering for the team, inspired by their burning desire to win.

The Lionhearts were giving it their all to win the title this season. It was a mission they had taken to heart, from the players on the field to the supporting staff in the backroom. The painful memory of defeat only fueled their desire for victory. Their dream of lifting the championship title was alive and burning brighter than ever before.","256,236,323,101,145,176,90,257,66,40,75,180,308,60,63,174,295,181,34,64,258,71,35,172,309,265,23,87,239,74,170,300,115,25,287,225,201,255,3,324,163,192,175,8,235,191,51,97,69,94,217,316,299,49,283,96,84,326,44,178,202,105,264,251,278,190,261,29,249,122,227,211,252,103,193,327,240,243,207,99,45,152,222,233,319,155,110,179,223,126,123,183,196,321,318,219,237,263,337,232,80,41,328,226,36,204,118,61,47,77,167,229,296,293,16,322,12,205,159,119,31,154,271,268,244,20,6,339,270,55,158,312,13,189,281,171,288,173,329,130,38,335,85,52,277,62,157,53,325,133,282,298,247,311,134,124,153,209,210,262,30,11,286,294,168,306,21,314,19,220,50,54,48,315,117,65,290,143,330,184,334,26,98,307,141,292,250,33,100,56,120,203,92,156,338,149,246,208,136,186","59,81,109,173,54,171,47,144,148,172,130","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
47,The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.,"James Marquez was not just any ordinary guy; he was a renowned poker player. Passionate, determined, and immensely gifted, he loved the thrill of the game, the suspenseful silence that hung over the table, and the moment of triumphant victory or crushing defeat. His favorite hangout was the popular upscale casino, Mirage, where he was known for his remarkable skill and audacious bets. 

On an icy winter night, James, in his usual suave tuxedo, was sitting amongst the casino's elite poker players. His azure eyes focused on the game at hand, he brimmed with a quiet confidence. The poker table was filled with smoke and the intoxicating scent of anticipation as each player eyeing their cards with hidden intentions. 

The dealer dealt the hand, and James was quick to pick up his two cards. A slow smile spread across his face as he glanced at them. He held a pair of Aces, the best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. His heart throbbed with excitement, but he kept his face as impassive as ever, masking his thrill behind his stoic demeanor.

He liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling as the game proceeded. Each time he called, the pot grew larger, and the suspense in the room thickened. The other players, unable to fathom his conviction, glanced at each other, their expressions a mixture of concern and intrigue.

Round after round, James relentlessly staked his money, all the while maintaining his poised facade. With every call, he pushed forward a substantial number of chips, the clinking sound of which seemed to echo in the eerily silent room. 

The game was progressing, and James's stack was gradually depleting. He watched with hooded eyes as the other players folded, one by one. Until it was only him and his toughest rival, the poker champion, Mark Taylor.

The final round approached, and the atmosphere around the table was at its peak. James had staked all his money, and it was a nail-biting situation for everyone present. Mark looked at him with an appraising eye, calculating his next move.

James, however, was brimming with confidence. He didn't flinch or show any sign of hesitance. When the dealer finally revealed the last card, it was another Ace. With a triumphant grin, James laid his cards down, a victorious trio of Aces. 

In one turn of a card, James had gone from an almost bankrupt player to the champion of the night. The room burst into applause, and for a moment, the sounds drowned out everything else. The thrill, the anticipation, the nail-biting tension, everything paid off in that one instant of victory. It was a risky move, staking everything he had on a hand, but that's who James was. And that's why he was a poker player beyond comparison.","245,0,299,155,145,213,310,328,252,174,196,126,8,222,238,120,200,122,201,257,76,165,172,277,305,110,64,28,15,61,10,235,276,142,334,150,89,308,46,45,297,16,101,1,14,18,86,311,6,19,105,157,114,124,187,333,318,55,282,22,97,58,65,111,2,216,263,321,240,123,20,275,44,37,327,251,156,113,104,82,300,313,144,337,285,315,42,48,207,53,205,291,90,85,103,284,43,5,233,83,320,112,288,324,220,139,54,56,247,4,294,164,206,195,38,52,158,32,212,92,50,272,34,152,102,128,307,194,178,170,69,121,177,280,13,95,59,140,63,41,168,221,197,171,78,182,287,71,29,329,325,230,119,130,209,35,143,26,306,49,302,36,17,266,23,186,75,250,135,269,314,166,192,264,27,234,226,271,265,188,239,181,51,148,99,190,31,273,292,7,295,330,274,60,236,296,81,159,11,241","73,40,39,88,160,121,183,116,90,107,58","1, 3, 23, 39, 40, 45, 48, 58, 61, 68, 73, 77, 80, 83, 88, 90, 94, 95, 101, 107, 110, 113, 116, 119, 122, 126, 130, 131, 135, 138, 141, 143, 144, 145, 147, 151, 152, 155, 157, 158, 161, 162, 166, 167, 169, 170, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
48,John studied all throughout college in the hopes of landing a good job. He made sacrifices and put in a lot of hard work.,"John had always been a studious young man, from his earliest years in grade school up until his senior year in high school. His ultimate aspiration was to land a good job, a dream he had been nurturing ever since he watched his father toil tirelessly at a job he despised. College then, was the logical next step in achieving this long-standing dream. He was filled with both excitement and nervous anticipation when he received his acceptance letter to a prestigious university, marking the beginning of this crucial phase of his life.

John knew, though, that getting into college was just half the battle won. He was well-aware of the grim reality that without hard work and sacrifice, his dream would remain just that - a dream. The first year of college was a period of adjustment. He had to get used to the rigors of an intense academic schedule, learn to manage his time effectively, and make sacrifices that most of his peers couldn't fathom.

While his friends spent their weekends partying and exploring the city, John would often be found hunched over his books in the silent university library. His dorm room, unlike the typical college student's, was a fortress of solitude, the walls adorned with study schedules and motivational quotes. The weekends, for him, were nothing more than an extension of the weekdays, dedicated solely to studying and completing assignments.

For John, every class was an opportunity to learn and expand his knowledge. He made an effort to maintain an open dialogue with his professors, often visiting them during office hours for clarification on complex topics. He valued their wisdom and experience, firmly believing that it would help him in his future endeavors.

Despite the sacrifices, the challenges, and the occasional bouts of loneliness, John persevered. His vision was clear - he had to excel in his studies, secure a good internship, and eventually, land a job that not only paid well but also provided intellectual stimulation.

The hard work began to bear fruit in his senior year. His excellent grades earned him an internship at one of the leading companies in his field of study. The internship was an invaluable learning experience and a stepping stone towards achieving his dream.

As graduation approached, John looked back at his college life filled with sacrifices, sleepless nights, and relentless hard work. It was a daunting journey, but he had no regrets. His dream job was within his grasp, and he knew, deep down, that all the sacrifices and hard work had indeed been worth it. He was now equipped with knowledge and experience, ready to face the challenges of the real world, all thanks to his years of dedication throughout college.","104,255,260,118,65,108,237,322,50,40,44,32,309,282,298,319,213,290,10,233,4,7,196,135,339,188,195,100,162,78,194,333,223,318,98,312,155,249,186,326,200,153,275,308,128,14,161,73,116,232,56,235,181,130,67,125,1,286,175,33,283,23,274,300,45,113,58,306,206,307,281,16,21,189,121,166,191,310,244,251,126,71,20,53,70,111,270,227,287,26,115,36,101,141,165,266,328,149,94,110,55,82,222,142,173,327,46,132,38,114,221,13,224,163,52,79,337,240,264,230,29,89,273,148,299,120,106,258,284,296,2,267,25,179,0,19,294,241,158,209,147,145,88,151,159,54,150,93,81,84,97,35,172,256,28,99,92,123,76,74,254,280,68,77,87,336,184,112,215,47,6,338,31,190,49,43,51,91,37,146,268,238,157,321,197,143,109,90,169,311,177,178,262,239,216,105,259,30,69,85","11,65,107,170,175,9,177,115,84,146,101","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
49,"The director finally completed the film, having done everything in his power to get the film released and bankrupting his production company.","Once a well-established individual within the film industry, the director started his own production company with dreams to create the best movies ever. With his experience, he believed in his potential to create unique films. Thus, he invested his all; not just his skills, efforts, and time, but his finances as well. The most recent project was of enormous importance to him, a film he had envisioned for years.

The day the idea for the film had struck him was still fresh in his memory. It was supposed to be a masterstroke, a cinematic marvel that would revolutionize the industry. He was absolutely certain about this film's success and staked his entire fortune behind it. A risky decision, but he saw it as the only way.

First, he hired a talented writer who composed an intricate and beautifully written script. Then, he got the best cast onboard - big names of the industry, ensuring his film would not lack star power. To bring his vision to life, he hired the most creative cinematographers, art directors, and music directors. No expense was spared on state-of-the-art equipment and exotic shooting locations. All he sought was the perfect film.

As production began, the director quickly realized that his ambitions were heavily straining his finances. The budget kept balloining, almost daily. But he was too far gone to back down and made the decision to press on. His team, too, shared his passion and stood by him in the toughest of times. 

Weeks turned into months, and the production of the film started taking a toll on him. Financial stress was ever-present; he started selling his personal assets, and even then, barely managing to keep things afloat. Despite this, the director pressed on, determined to see his dream on the big screen.

Finally, after several grueling months, the film was completed. It was a moment of bittersweet triumph for the director. The relief was unimaginable, but the joy was tinged with the bitter taste of bankruptcy. His production company was on the verge of financial collapse.

His employees felt his pain, but at the same time, were proud of the result. The director had completed the film, having done everything in his power to get it released. He had exhausted his means, depleted his resources, and ultimately bankrupted his once thriving production company. 

In the end, he stood on the precipice of a precipitous journey. He looked at the final cut and thought to himself, ""It was all worth it."" Whether the film was successful or not, only time would tell. But, for him, the journey was the reward. The director had done his part; he had completed his dream film. The rest was in the hands of fate.","146,300,128,66,294,237,132,45,236,147,35,174,115,131,95,291,297,337,232,37,161,143,203,111,101,224,256,106,302,153,64,185,169,289,36,65,33,269,117,331,130,103,86,211,251,4,283,335,338,20,155,315,151,234,122,32,229,98,238,274,51,242,53,181,196,164,187,248,94,265,163,55,11,69,303,8,157,158,227,278,295,266,179,96,40,299,319,44,54,209,175,193,60,218,172,17,220,59,165,270,48,192,180,52,9,62,264,136,46,41,85,268,135,116,239,134,228,77,204,216,18,88,141,47,97,149,191,271,221,78,284,13,105,326,109,139,99,320,328,82,259,150,79,293,230,222,182,16,34,108,125,1,321,329,205,75,201,233,178,80,162,73,160,56,156,10,308,313,167,14,7,137,89,148,307,263,250,281,190,123,58,296,50,22,183,316,171,200,301,261,195,255,142,254,245,339,327,124,21,104","88,8,109,124,101,183,61,104,63,89,72","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He had sent a collection of spreadsheets, each littered with raw data that needed to be analyzed and processed. ""Can you get these done by Monday?"" he had casually thrown in. My heart sunk as I opened the first file and saw the enormity of the data. That's when I decided - I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.

Knowing the Herculean effort it would require, I started planning my approach. I strategized the best way to tackle the spreadsheets and decided on a methodical system. On Wednesday night, I sorted through the first three, familiarizing myself with the data. The numbers and columns were blurring together, but I kept at it, hour by hour, spreadsheet after spreadsheet.

Thursday came with a fresh set of challenges. I discovered inconsistencies in the data. It wasn't just about going through the spreadsheets; it was about questioning the data, finding the errors, and rectifying them. By the end of the day, I had barely made a dent. My eyes were tired, my back ached, but my resolve wasn't broken. 

Friday was a blur of numbers, pivot tables, and conditional formatting. I cancelled my plans with friends, telling them about the looming Monday deadline. They understood; we've all been there. By the time my clock hit midnight, I had managed to clean up and analyze half of the data.

On Saturday, my dedication didn't falter. I worked methodically, my fingers flying over the keyboard, eyes scanning row after row of data. It was a test of my patience and perseverance. I lived off coffee and takeout, clocking in more than ten hours straight.

Finally, Sunday came. I could see the finish line, but there was still a significant portion left. My mind and body were screaming for a break, but the determination to fulfill my commitment powered me through. I was on the home stretch, the data making sense now, the patterns emerging.

When Monday dawned, I sent the completed analysis to my boss. My hands shook from exhaustion, but I felt a wave of satisfaction wash over me. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I did it, working for it hook, line, and sinker. It had been a grueling journey, but I made it to the end.","66,32,251,216,333,14,112,248,142,85,177,159,335,68,313,111,62,39,198,180,137,105,289,185,21,204,139,9,20,130,64,43,186,155,331,88,267,319,297,179,337,163,127,54,24,203,161,277,83,78,181,172,299,13,73,175,316,298,47,12,144,100,96,190,274,247,165,189,303,273,125,233,81,311,124,188,326,294,89,28,45,238,309,176,162,99,272,243,276,119,173,196,152,55,29,278,222,52,23,110,265,178,234,115,310,244,291,160,57,49,37,113,211,290,197,95,254,280,338,97,166,1,256,255,231,79,252,0,194,329,11,330,51,40,128,60,147,195,332,19,285,282,304,305,312,246,253,320,87,164,192,270,300,17,268,44,107,220,236,106,325,25,230,16,242,46,207,232,53,5,103,199,205,77,193,48,117,146,223,239,241,250,183,67,321,38,170,90,114,229,150,225,315,22,76,151,41,283,307,69","156,81,166,59,176,110,133,98,169,44,94","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
51,I am determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.,"Ever since I was a young girl, I've observed my mother painstakingly prepare the Thanksgiving dinner with love and care. She made everything from scratch, using recipes that were passed down from generation to generation. Each year, I would watch in awe as she effortlessly juggled multiple dishes at once, creating a feast that left us all savoring every bite. Despite her offers to show me the ropes, I always found an excuse to wiggle out of the task, fearing I could never match up to her expertise. 

This year, however, was different. My mother had taken ill recently and was too weak to handle the kitchen. As the Thanksgiving holiday approached, a realization dawned upon me. It was my turn to step up and keep our family traditions alive. Hence, I made up my mind - I would cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time, no matter how difficult it was.

Unsure of where to begin, I called my mother into the kitchen. I could see the spark of excitement in her eyes as I told her about my resolution. Together, we looked through our family cookbook, deciding on the menu - roasted turkey, candied yams, cranberry sauce, green beans casserole, pumpkin pie, and more. She shared secret tips and tricks with me, taking me through the nuances of each dish.

The kitchen was a warzone on Thanksgiving day. Pots and pans cluttered the counters and stovetop, ingredients littered the table, and I was in the middle of it all, slightly overwhelmed but wholly determined. I followed each recipe to a tee, persisting through minor mishaps and learning from my mistakes. The hours flew by, a blur of stirring, mixing, and baking.

Slowly but surely, the dishes started coming together. The aroma of the turkey roasting and the sweet scent of the pie filling the air heightened my anticipation. It was not as easy as I had thought, but I pushed myself to finish the daunting task. 

As we sat around the dining table, a sense of satisfaction washed over me. The moment everyone took their first bite and complimented the food, I felt my nerves melt away. Despite the challenges, the stress, and the chaos, I had successfully prepared our Thanksgiving dinner from scratch. I looked towards my mother, her eyes gleaming with pride and happiness.

From that day forward, I vowed never to shy away from this yearly task, but to embrace it and carry on the tradition no matter how difficult it may seem. For it was not just about preparing a meal but about creating memories and upholding a cherished family legacy.","286,220,53,281,71,49,331,251,38,283,37,85,179,315,333,80,138,200,113,75,181,240,121,196,270,225,242,156,126,12,154,163,0,264,47,329,316,171,39,155,82,255,193,313,227,199,164,280,141,131,55,162,224,324,3,335,24,205,317,66,269,330,133,246,176,87,91,241,238,35,104,26,276,107,337,334,305,46,94,204,135,106,195,90,25,124,297,217,77,110,332,114,300,309,327,234,16,115,290,184,148,149,48,323,302,29,289,271,262,182,178,209,258,169,111,284,261,295,144,50,322,97,86,69,207,263,74,282,319,5,40,27,235,236,161,183,197,266,165,214,168,314,54,52,259,103,105,254,99,95,45,239,137,310,23,20,338,152,93,318,34,117,244,79,229,119,83,57,288,22,312,41,151,219,9,174,36,116,252,118,221,76,92,19,42,233,211,102,167,65,232,143,159,243,142,60,132,222,44,67","199,151,78,35,103,6,120,144,3,143,51","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
52,Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.,"Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a boy named Harry. Harry was not an ordinary boy; he had a zest for life and an unwavering spirit, which he used to push himself towards his biggest passion – running. His dream was to win the final race of the National Athletics Championship.

Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race; every day, he was seen on the track putting in each and every ounce of energy he had into training. He would wake up early in the morning, even before the sun had risen, lace up his running shoes, and hit the track. With the cold breeze kissing his face, he would start his rigorous regimen.

His training routine was tough; he used to start with a light jog which then turned into an intense sprint, pushing his limits and testing his endurance. After hours of strenuous exercise, he would then indulge in some muscle-strengthening activities. This training not only tested his physical strength but his mental fortitude as well.

Every day was a challenge, and with each passing day, the final race loomed closer. However, he never let his determination waver, and he kept motivating himself, reminding himself of his goal - the final race victory. His friends would often invite him to join their leisurely activities, but he politely declined, focussed on his goal.

The townsfolk admired his perseverance; some would often stop to watch him sprint around the track. They admired his discipline and dedication, often pointing him out as an inspiration to their children. Harry’s unwavering dedication to his goal made him the talk of the town.

His coach, an ex-champion, admired his grit and determination. He saw a younger version of himself in Harry. The coach was strict, but he knew that Harry had what it took to win the final race. He would push Harry beyond his limits, not because he was unkind, but because he wanted Harry to believe that there was no limit.

Each training session left Harry physically exhausted, his body aching from the intensity. But his eyes sparkled with a certain determination, a certain stubbornness, refusing to back down. Every drop of sweat, every groan of pain, was a symbol of the willpower that lived within him.

With each passing day, Harry's speed increased, his body became more resilient, and his dream of winning the final race became more prominent in his mind. He knew the road was tough, but his determination was tougher. The final race was no more a dream for him; it had become his reality.

Finally, the day of the race arrived. Standing on the start line, Harry felt a surge of adrenaline; the outcome was uncertain, but one thing was sure - he had given it his all in preparing for this day. No matter the result, he was a winner, for he had put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.","250,150,136,323,126,318,57,174,267,12,168,241,243,46,270,259,273,16,105,158,183,109,72,144,70,324,223,76,53,157,175,20,313,95,134,299,208,262,125,322,7,74,68,303,18,195,51,256,167,184,118,128,199,147,164,87,49,48,242,179,47,17,280,268,205,111,219,50,258,339,218,321,86,65,293,188,309,220,137,24,222,140,312,35,124,308,110,45,165,133,39,331,284,97,21,197,77,320,154,66,149,44,37,32,272,249,229,310,330,253,181,33,305,78,187,327,246,15,19,202,192,277,286,217,30,26,194,282,104,307,329,81,255,185,177,100,198,240,316,226,29,131,56,171,314,209,120,203,6,274,269,231,96,54,281,146,55,43,325,294,296,261,161,295,3,64,34,159,230,180,117,103,271,216,129,36,172,248,2,301,204,25,79,328,221,63,156,225,38,92,40,106,121,291,23,22,236,201,14,89","102,88,14,61,58,57,68,47,29,154,157","1, 8, 14, 27, 46, 58, 67, 72, 88, 98"
53,Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.,"Sally was brought up in a household filled with deep faith. The foundation of her childhood was rooted in religious beliefs, and Sally proudly carried them through her life. As an adult, she remained steadfast in her faith, a beacon of unwavering conviction to everyone around her. People around her had contrasting views, and she was often pitted against societal norms that contradicted her beliefs. However, Sally was resilient. She was stubborn and refused to compromise her spiritual path for anyone.

It was this strength of character that saw her planning a religious ceremony that was unusual and controversial in her community. She was going to perform a full ritual in accordance with her beliefs. Many around her condemned her decision. Her friends tried to dissuade her, arguing it would ostracise her further from their increasingly secular community. Even her family, who shared the same faith, tried to talk her out of it, fearing societal backlash. 

But Sally was adamant. She had prepared for this her entire life. She loved her faith and believed it was her duty to uphold the traditions associated with it. She had always felt a deep connection to the rituals and found them profoundly moving. She was convinced that this ceremony was the right path, no matter the consequences. 

She began the preparations for the ceremony. Her zeal and determination were evident in every little detail that she meticulously took care of. From the prayer arrangements to the symbolic artefacts, everything was done with complete dedication. She prepared herself mentally and spiritually, immersing herself in scripture study and prayer. Despite the apprehensions, her spirit remained unbroken.

Finally, the day arrived. Sally greeted it with a calm mind and an unshaken resolve. She was aware of the disapproval and scepticism in the air, but she held her head high. The ceremony began, and Sally's conviction was palpable in every word she uttered, every gesture she made. 

She felt an overpowering sense of tranquillity and fulfilment throughout the ceremony. When it concluded, there was a profound silence. Even those who had opposed her couldn't deny the depth of her faith and the sincerity of her convictions. Though the ceremony was unconventional, it was executed with utmost respect and reverence.

Sally was a testament to the power of belief. She had shown everyone around her that no societal pressure could deter her from her path. Her adamancy and stubbornness about her religious beliefs were not a sign of obstinacy but a display of immense conviction and love for her faith.","84,159,198,80,294,171,135,102,276,54,64,213,58,151,36,105,269,215,134,96,224,142,232,164,302,268,74,167,207,254,12,288,146,61,257,67,50,68,170,143,278,29,286,8,337,336,95,290,124,255,155,193,315,329,263,56,178,301,15,331,307,241,24,108,104,249,229,47,272,195,4,129,174,21,245,107,186,5,308,40,316,10,116,79,35,118,231,43,57,136,200,161,46,23,16,339,305,246,260,149,122,211,75,244,223,251,267,27,71,216,192,91,202,44,33,334,28,156,131,93,48,52,140,197,176,49,1,32,110,206,225,112,270,184,9,157,250,277,282,209,42,45,100,97,299,132,111,138,87,60,14,262,13,17,55,281,114,234,86,240,26,18,323,11,318,273,25,313,335,309,175,310,221,115,326,172,303,306,98,120,295,271,144,37,83,214,314,180,236,261,203,252,51,119,85,199,330,218,191,238","114,142,93,68,121,126,37,193,122,10,155","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
54,I was completely against nationalization. I resisted it wholeheartedly even though I became quite unpopular in the process.,"As a political science professor at the local university, I've always held steadfast in my belief system, upholding certain values that I consider quintessential for economic prosperity and personal freedom. One of the ideologies I was completely against was the concept of nationalization.

Every semester, in every class, I took it upon myself to explain my stance on this topic. I debated about it, I wrote essays about it and taught my students why I believed so. Many among them found my stand controversial, yet intriguing. I openly resisted the idea of the state owning or controlling businesses and industries. I presented numerous historical examples of how nationalization could lead to corruption, inefficiency and potentially stifle competition. 

However, this strong position gradually led me to stand at the crossroads of popularity. It pitted me against some colleagues who ardently favored this concept. A divide grew between us, and collegial meetings became a battleground of ideological warfare. They were quick to label me as a capitalist, whose sole aim was to protect the rich and exploit the poor. 

The wider student community was also split. Some appreciated my honest perspective, while others saw me as a barrier to progressive economic policies. There were whispers around the campus, labelling me as a self-centered intellectual, detached from the realities of economic disparity. 

Rumours circulated that I was lobbying against any syllabus change which might introduce nationalization in a positive light. Some students even went as far as to demand my termination. I was invited to fewer staff meetings, and many a time, my opinion was disregarded in the decision-making process. 

Despite all this, I persisted. I continued to stand firm, holding on to my belief that unfettered competition and private ownership are the foundations of economic growth and prosperity. I was unwavering, even though this stance made me quite unpopular in the process.

I wanted my students to engage with multiple perspectives, even ones that they disagreed with, for I believed that an open exchange of ideas was fundamental to their education. True, I was a solitary voice in a sea of contrary opinions. Yet, even in the face of adversity, I held firm, standing my ground, valuing my principles over popularity. 

In my heart, I knew that even if my ideas were rejected, at least I had dared to challenge the norm, spark debate and potentially plant the seeds for future critical thinking. After all, the world of academia should foster diversity of thought, not suppress it.","125,290,300,44,266,287,122,34,224,119,246,46,199,209,124,188,268,26,283,216,135,101,193,206,129,63,94,1,276,58,15,128,77,318,131,338,28,72,195,112,64,299,275,293,116,43,298,320,301,249,173,45,163,19,130,93,240,38,71,82,222,303,10,79,183,5,85,201,233,234,170,284,319,151,37,236,210,89,203,33,123,327,335,280,114,228,8,265,330,47,146,23,232,181,247,326,40,4,50,337,51,207,244,148,296,21,264,292,2,317,279,106,285,154,229,217,189,86,158,239,29,27,78,250,313,111,92,289,144,308,149,167,68,172,35,83,208,316,273,133,231,196,155,245,104,134,269,309,160,270,41,143,73,87,288,20,70,18,52,278,258,84,30,17,194,49,277,60,162,24,307,220,333,253,91,16,295,274,42,175,22,55,321,48,205,213,12,76,312,291,138,53,257,99,168,281,324,56,198,11","4,52,12,90,184,166,99,101,159,192,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
55,Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.,"From the time Larry turned eighteen, there was just one person he ever envisioned working for, and that was Frank. Frank, a self-made entrepreneur, was the owner of a successful construction company in their small town. Larry was awed by the way Frank ran his business, always prioritizing integrity and the well-being of his employees. He was drawn to his compassion, his leadership, and his impeccable work ethic. It was this profound admiration that had planted a firm idea in Larry's mind that he should work for Frank, and no one else.

Larry had the chance to work with many different employers over the years. He was a diligent worker, skilled in many areas, which made him desirable to many local businesses. From the local diner owner to the factory manager, they all admired Larry's dedication and earnestness. They tried to lure him into their fold with promises of higher pay and comfortable work hours, but Larry was unmoved. Frank was his goal, and no amount of convincing could change his mind.

When Larry turned twenty-two, he started his own small handyman service. It was tough, and money was tight, but he was undeterred. He believed the hands-on experience would make him a stronger candidate to work for Frank. He gained a reputation for his hard work and was often praised for his efforts, but the praise didn't hold the same value as working under Frank would.

Every morning, Larry would pass by Frank's company, eyeing the employees at work, longing to be a part of them. He envisioned himself, donned in the company's uniform, working alongside the others, learning from Frank himself. He was often lost in daydreams of Frank mentoring him, teaching him the subtle intricacies of running a successful business with grace and dignity.

One day, Larry gathered his courage and approached Frank. He expressed his admiration and his desire to work under his leadership. Frank was impressed by his dedication and persistence. He admired Larry's determination, acknowledging how unusual it was to see such loyalty, especially when it had been so steadfast in the face of other seemingly attractive opportunities.

A week later, Larry received a letter from Frank's company. His heart pounding in his chest, he carefully opened it and scanned the contents. He was offered a position to work under Frank's supervision, his dream finally coming true.

Larry was overjoyed. He knew his dedication and unwavering belief in Frank had finally paid off. Working for other employers would have probably been easier, but he was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. And now, all his hard work had led to the fulfilment of his dream. The experience taught Larry that unwavering determination, despite challenges and temptations, indeed reaps reward.","23,210,223,309,21,136,335,170,99,184,274,207,144,35,153,281,29,114,43,235,171,61,149,250,248,14,119,13,5,118,313,199,315,308,104,141,283,292,227,304,324,31,71,198,123,24,287,218,222,259,46,268,336,317,276,97,19,64,36,181,290,209,110,121,48,169,234,323,154,269,83,185,17,88,151,289,232,254,251,338,32,327,228,211,98,132,278,56,261,272,125,166,212,27,325,258,326,279,173,57,282,148,1,257,225,224,107,226,101,319,291,299,237,159,322,217,183,174,137,39,142,205,196,252,302,131,108,307,140,157,135,233,337,0,122,152,79,247,263,240,78,219,179,265,158,11,305,22,130,69,165,16,45,280,332,67,311,236,12,126,264,271,267,52,220,15,112,301,285,256,333,303,188,339,242,70,50,7,249,82,53,192,47,255,180,41,49,288,128,94,26,164,84,51,34,54,298,203,73,44","200,153,51,183,65,187,177,194,164,181,196","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
56,"The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.","As an art teacher, I always held the belief that a drawing could depict so much more than the written word ever could. To me, art was a swift stroke of emotions and thoughts, showcasing a universe that books painstakingly tried to create using multitudes of pages. My passion for art was so intense that even when a student presented a rough sketch, I could see their emotions materializing on paper.

One day during class, I handed out blank sheets of paper and asked the students to simply draw. ""Remember, each stroke should tell a story,"" I encouraged them. The room was soon filled with the quiet scratching sound of pencils moving on paper.

After an hour or so, my eyes landed on a drawing sketched by one of my quieter students, Emily. It was a simple, yet powerful illustration of a girl standing on the edge of a cliff, staring into the limitless horizon. A cool breeze seemed to whisper through her flowing hair and her eyes, even though mere pencil strokes, held a world of emotions within them.

Without a word being spoken, the drawing took me on a journey that a book could only have accomplished in many pages. This was her story, her feelings, and her viewpoint, laid out in subtle shades of grey.

Emily's drawing struck me in an inexplicable way. It was a testament to her loneliness, resilience, and the abundance of hope she held onto. I could almost feel the cool wind on the cliff, sense the solitude that she was experiencing, and yet see the glimmers of optimism in her eyes.

As I was lost in the artistic depiction of her inner world, I felt a sense of bonding with her. I understood her like I would only have after reading numerous pages about her in a book. However, the intimacy and immediacy of this understanding were far more profound in this context.

Emily didn't need to pen down lengthy paragraphs to express her fears, her courage, or her dreams. Her drawing revealed so much at just one glance, something a book would have required chapters for.

I praised Emily for her excellent piece of art and asked her if she would like to share her feelings or the story behind it. Emily, with a smile on her face and a sparkle in her eyes, simply said, ""I don't need to, sir. The drawing already has."" 

That day I understood that pictures, indeed, are worth a thousand words, if not more. The drawing served as a reminder of the power of art, capable of weaving a narrative that even a book sometimes struggles to portray in an entire volume. From then on, I endeavored to incorporate this philosophy into my teaching, emphasizing that a drawing can indeed show, at one glance, what a book can only show in many pages.","206,243,100,265,279,99,82,11,131,57,309,182,167,80,153,59,193,14,294,252,331,290,217,42,158,189,197,31,337,163,177,327,169,194,336,238,71,135,207,113,205,188,334,191,174,121,274,242,239,253,183,199,257,209,232,244,141,130,161,295,2,308,160,170,156,247,249,289,72,258,101,78,13,213,112,58,173,122,211,328,61,333,84,302,221,91,124,119,267,164,241,303,94,67,107,68,20,178,62,49,52,225,226,283,47,35,304,261,63,26,125,339,55,12,288,142,79,111,329,28,201,335,60,15,37,297,237,65,25,10,143,132,277,127,115,155,162,203,312,73,220,315,282,166,284,233,30,256,187,260,75,117,3,76,16,235,306,108,157,81,39,21,251,286,176,38,144,45,311,318,140,246,128,109,323,70,269,338,93,102,48,179,204,186,202,293,275,54,116,208,147,313,53,223,264,29,74,9,90,195","10,76,16,123,81","1, 5, 17, 20, 24, 27, 34, 41, 44, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, 65, 69, 75, 78, 82, 85, 89, 93, 98, 102, 106, 110, 114, 117, 122, 126, 130, 135, 138, 142, 147, 151, 155, 159, 164, 168, 172, 176, 180, 184, 188, 192, 196, 200"
57,I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.,"Once upon a time, in a bustling city full of sky-rising buildings and noisy streets, there lived a young man named Daniel. Despite being an accountant by profession, Daniel had always held a deep-seated fascination for stories. His apartment was a testament to this love, as it was filled with piles of books scattered around like mini skyscrapers. But his latest obsession had not been a book. It was an adaptation of a book, or rather, a series of them, made into a high-budget television series.

Daniel heard of the series, ""Chronicles of the Sacred Kingdom,"" through a coworker who had been babbling enthusiastically about it. It was an epic fantasy series that had captured the world by storm, built around five massive books each running into more than 700 pages. Daniel hadn't touched fantasy in a while but hearing the rave reviews it received from coworkers and friends, his curiosity was piqued.

He considered diving into the books first, as was his habit, but the sheer volume of each tome daunted him. The numbers only multiplied when he realized there were five of these massive books. The thought of reading so much in his limited free time, sandwiched between his busy work schedule, was overwhelming.

Then it occurred to Daniel: why not try something different? He could just watch the adaptation instead of reading the books the series was based on. With a lot less time investment, he would be able to experience the story and join the conversations his friends were having.

With this plan in mind, Daniel subscribed to the streaming service airing ""Chronicles of the Sacred Kingdom."" Every evening after work, he'd brew a fresh pot of coffee, switch off his phone, and get lost in the fantastical lands of the series.

The show brought the world of the Sacred Kingdom to life in a way Daniel hadn't imagined. He was transported to a different realm, full of magic, dragons, and complex characters with intriguing backstories. As he watched the thrilling battles, unpredictable plot twists, and phenomenal performances, he started to truly appreciate the power of adaptation.

Daniel's decision to watch the adaptation instead of reading the books seemed a smart move. He realized that adaptations offer a distinct but equally delightful experience. The visual effects and performances could enrich a story in ways books often couldn't.

Seeing the fantasy world take shape on the screen gave Daniel a sense of satisfaction. The experience was different from reading, but in a unique and mesmerizing way. Daniel enjoyed the beautiful, visual storytelling that the adaptation offered, and he was glad he decided to watch it instead of committing to the five massive books.

And so, Daniel's evenings were filled with epic sagas of the Sacred Kingdom, illuminating his mundane life with a touch of magic. His conversations with friends and coworkers were spiced up with exciting discussions about the series. He found that he enjoyed the adaptation just as much, if not more, than reading the books.

In the end, Daniel realized that adaptations had their charm, a way of unraveling stories that was unique and compelling. The phrase, 'Don't judge a book by its movie,' didn't hold true for him anymore. He realized that sometimes, just sometimes, you can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the books.","285,28,30,13,327,93,261,99,317,224,78,159,313,49,316,303,160,210,207,85,322,229,53,236,176,267,101,59,163,88,220,180,173,117,127,26,288,38,281,81,100,158,39,330,45,240,256,311,246,42,183,124,190,221,77,55,27,233,63,8,286,34,280,321,318,257,266,225,138,274,15,5,312,33,299,102,60,333,227,325,319,203,270,132,136,277,115,186,162,105,82,166,161,211,14,310,128,315,293,71,104,181,175,19,226,75,252,4,196,10,187,107,237,125,295,309,56,290,98,67,18,165,151,177,213,275,255,76,65,144,95,9,109,172,51,171,48,146,284,278,247,195,242,116,79,208,111,218,73,114,294,329,328,84,222,43,215,62,300,86,46,174,113,192,205,231,35,241,276,32,212,209,21,70,307,199,223,153,188,193,61,185,335,134,337,87,234,189,120,243,80,141,235,314,2,149,58,271,92,179","117,197,28,77,181","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
58,A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.,"James had been a smoker for over 20 years, ever since his college days. The pleasure of puffing away on cigarettes was a habitual comfort to him, an integral part of his routine. He'd have a smoke with his morning coffee, another after lunch, and a few scattered throughout the day. Despite the statutory warnings on the back of the pack, the danger of smoking seemed distant and intangible to James.

He had seen the text warning of heart disease, lung cancer, and even stroke numerous times. The words 'smoking kills' or 'smoking is injurious to health' didn't hold any profound meaning to him anymore. They were just obligatory sentences mandated by the law, incorporated into the design of the cigarette pack. It was as though his mind had conditioned itself to ignore these warnings and enjoy the comforting puff of smoke.

One day, however, he purchased a new pack of cigarettes. This time, there was something new on the back of the pack that caught his attention. Instead of the statutory warnings he was so accustomed to ignoring, there was a chilling picture of diseased lungs. The lungs were blackened and scarred, filled with frighteningly graphic signs of decay.

The image struck a nerve in James like the text warnings never had. The stark visual image depicting the harsh reality of what his lungs could look like shocked him. This was more real, more tangible. Seeing the horrifying result of decades of smoking was more potent than reading about it.

For the first time, he was forced to confront the detrimental effects of his addiction. The graphic picture brought the future damage smoking could cause right in front of his eyes. It was no longer just words that were easy to brush aside, but a visual presentation that was hard to ignore or forget.

The ensuing days saw a change in James. He found himself unable to enjoy his cigarettes as before, the image of those diseased lungs constantly intruding his thoughts. The desire to light a cigarette was tinged with fear, an underlying awareness of the harm he was inflicting upon himself.

The picture made him consider quitting smoking seriously. It served as a constant reminder that his health was on the line, that each cigarette was taking him one step closer to the destruction portrayed in the picture. The change was gradual, but it was significant.

Eventually, he decided to stop smoking altogether. Whenever he felt the urge to smoke, he would glance at the disturbing picture on the back of the cigarette pack. It was a deterrent that reminded him of the gruesome path he was veering away from.

Thus, the picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs had done what the statutory warning message could not. It had managed to shatter James's complacent attitude towards smoking, helping him kick the deadly habit that had a tight grip on him for years.","300,69,261,162,307,91,255,322,140,177,96,227,332,228,9,310,141,168,53,109,106,20,125,249,230,175,165,274,205,47,278,209,23,283,104,25,313,90,97,133,250,89,266,189,80,11,1,303,127,270,93,297,42,316,71,161,138,176,33,24,102,0,10,63,305,321,167,273,263,44,61,193,95,223,233,291,171,277,3,137,85,218,213,287,196,143,115,14,36,46,56,234,174,285,219,217,57,197,60,107,77,315,333,78,139,83,54,92,73,314,180,111,294,29,108,2,302,65,84,292,324,271,88,182,275,289,128,118,149,203,295,268,28,173,288,145,98,191,82,336,132,148,235,67,94,22,8,169,38,39,254,35,59,150,208,226,244,70,338,239,246,272,296,265,264,311,318,100,136,146,243,286,37,187,236,158,5,12,211,251,114,131,269,198,34,186,164,194,282,117,210,225,45,329,293,328,116,335,6,204","91,97,153,99,71","1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
59,Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.,"Every Friday, I make it a habit to attend an event that the local startup community hosts. This gathering is a platform for start-ups, both emerging and established, to showcase their products or services and share their ideas. I always look forward to these gatherings, being a journalist at heart and in profession, constantly on the hunt for unique ideas and untapped talents in the world of business. 

One particular Friday, my attention was captured by a new startup. From the moment they started their presentation, there was a sense of sincerity and dedication that was palpable. Their approach was unorthodox, delivering a pitch that felt more like a candid conversation than a rehearsed speech. 

Their company focused on developing sustainable energy solutions. The marketing and advertising materials they'd produced until then were somewhat vague and abstract, replete with colorful illustrations, technical jargon, and futuristic concepts. It was an unappealing mix of fanciful dreams and complex engineering that didn't truly deliver their message.

But their business pitch - it was a revelation. In simple, engaging language, they explained the dire need for innovative, affordable, and sustainable energy solutions. They illustrated the shortcomings of the current energy industry. They clearly communicated their dedication to bridge the gap, creating solutions that would not only meet energy demands but do so without harming the environment.

In their pitch, they not only provided detailed information about their products but also made a compelling case about why such solutions were needed in the first place. They went beyond the features and benefits of their product; they painted a picture of a world improved by their technology. 

They discussed their team, outlining each member's qualifications, passions, and commitment to the company's mission. It wasn't just their words, but their unity and confident poise that convincingly made their case.

They answered questions eloquently and without hesitation. They tackled criticism with grace and accepted suggestions with gratitude. They were open, transparent, and honest. These were the signs of a company worth trusting, a brand worth believing in.

As they concluded their pitch, the room erupted in applause. The informative and insightful presentation had turned skeptics into believers. People were eager to hear more, to learn more, and more importantly, to invest more. It was unlike anything we’d seen from them before.

Hearing the startup give its business pitch was definitely more informative and impactful than any of their marketing and advertising efforts. It made me realize that there's a gap that many startups overlook. Passionate stories often get lost in marketing materials, but can be found in personal interactions, shared with sincerity and conviction. That day, I witnessed the true potential of a compelling business pitch. It gave me, and the others, an entirely new understanding of their startup.","90,309,23,143,321,283,111,281,186,252,0,11,114,223,93,5,22,315,265,68,97,81,9,241,299,238,314,204,209,331,234,263,264,146,77,119,233,257,147,290,236,4,128,108,18,86,41,278,62,245,333,47,324,56,302,277,261,137,98,232,103,292,145,102,163,106,57,262,221,67,329,207,255,260,254,222,101,61,313,336,305,79,307,214,244,320,70,179,24,332,273,109,105,151,203,46,44,259,295,326,176,142,78,156,166,69,190,14,282,328,134,63,220,270,168,178,192,60,149,200,21,64,206,58,8,339,88,25,235,175,29,181,319,127,48,296,288,334,180,28,126,330,110,159,125,274,304,310,327,34,173,51,211,55,247,311,284,194,136,117,213,248,224,172,291,167,115,91,133,246,188,54,249,183,42,155,275,131,96,95,27,35,150,87,322,316,160,197,268,298,49,191,71,170,122,20,286,148,13,184","54,67,124,118,78","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
60,It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.,"John was a man of many talents, but one area in which he was undeniably lacking was his sense of direction. All his life, he would consistently find himself lost in places both familiar and unfamiliar. This trait of his often brought about hilarious, and at times, embarrassing situations, which caused him to be infamous among his circle of friends.

One day, John received an invitation to attend an important event, a fundraising charity gala held at a luxurious, yet notoriously hard-to-find mansion on the outskirts of the city. John had never been to this part of the city and was initially worried about finding the mansion on his own. He feared getting lost, which would not only lead to late arrival but also a fair share of ribbing from his friends.

The invitation came with detailed instructions on how to reach the venue. They were neatly arranged in bullet points, apparently designed to assist in navigating the labyrinthine roads leading to the mansion. However, even as he read and reread the instructions, John couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of uncertainty.

Feeling increasingly concerned, John decided to seek help from his best friend, George, who was known for his excellent sense of direction. George, on hearing about John's predicament, laughed heartily before offering him a piece of advice. 

""John,"" George said, grinning broadly, ""You know yourself. It's better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event."" He slid a well-worn map across the table.

John stared at the map dubiously. It was filled with squiggly lines, symbols, and names that were difficult to make out. 

With George's patient guidance, however, things started to make sense. The mansion, the winding roads, the roundabouts, everything appeared clearer on the map than they were in the written instructions. A sense of relief washed over him, and he thanked George heartily for the assistance. 

The day of the event arrived, and armed with his map and newfound confidence, John set out on his journey. Sure enough, he navigated his way through the city's outskirts with little to no difficulty, much to his own surprise.

As John arrived at the mansion, he was greeted by his friends who were astonished at his punctuality. John simply smiled, holding up his map victoriously. From then on, John realized that sometimes a visual guide could be much more valuable than a set of written instructions. He made it a point to always carry a map when embarking on unfamiliar journeys.","203,211,286,117,321,310,122,180,238,334,324,53,221,55,113,44,234,186,182,300,320,258,299,217,338,229,318,308,302,0,153,196,201,146,269,39,288,77,210,141,34,309,84,83,280,317,259,326,148,330,139,222,108,339,171,225,111,10,296,193,78,301,291,61,279,115,137,99,250,47,329,24,95,216,42,251,261,162,294,289,215,168,155,246,191,165,75,207,333,257,64,219,51,28,285,192,150,214,159,3,169,181,255,241,262,52,112,138,237,37,80,58,124,102,133,163,274,57,172,245,110,281,327,194,265,152,209,158,81,132,208,49,195,303,205,157,306,97,101,98,307,26,231,161,29,151,174,43,127,202,62,9,270,311,104,86,71,45,114,56,109,337,213,173,59,298,123,107,7,206,243,260,8,277,88,66,27,272,41,116,295,17,70,178,264,120,200,31,76,198,103,5,336,252,166,93,65,79,248,106","160,118,112,165,64","1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
61,Mary prefered to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.,"Once upon a time, in a small yet bustling city, there lived a young woman named Mary. Mary was an enthusiastic person and had a profound curiosity for learning new things. Being a keen and innovative mechanical engineering student, she always had her eyes on the myriad of devices that came her way.

Everyday, she would attend her lectures, in which professors delivered copious amounts of technical information about intricate mechanical processes. After every class, they provided hand-written notes to the students, covering every minor detail that had been discussed. Most of the students relied heavily on these notes, considering them as a major tool for understanding the subject.

However, Mary found herself adrift. She tried comprehending the operations through the professors' notes, but it always seemed like an arduous task. She had a hard time imagining the designs and mechanisms just based on those wordy explanations. Trying to visualize the parts of an engine or a machine from the texts was becoming a strenuous effort for her, and it was obvious that she wasn't grasping the entire picture.

One day, she got her hands on an old textbook, which, instead of detailed explanations, had various diagrams depicting different mechanical processes. Out of curiosity, she started studying those diagrams and quickly realized that she could understand the processes much better this way. It was easier for her to comprehend the mechanism when she had a visual representation of the process in front of her.

From that day on, Mary preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes rather than from the notes describing them. She found that diagrams allowed her to imagine and understand the processes in a more practical and comprehensive way. For her, the shapes, the angles, the arrangements all started making more sense when they were visually depicted. The diagrams painted a clear picture of the systems, which the wordy descriptions in her professors' notes had failed to achieve.

This method of learning played a significant role in Mary's academic success. She started doing well in her exams and projects. She was able to practically implement her understanding of diagrams into reality when working on her engineering assignments.

Her story is a testament that everyone has a different way of learning, and it's okay to carve your own path if the conventional ways don't work for you. For Mary, the diagrams of the processes were her key to a comprehensive understanding, proving that visual learning is a powerful tool. In the end, her perseverance and the courage to find her own way of learning resulted in her becoming a successful and revered engineer in her field.","193,260,111,200,18,172,73,266,54,204,326,32,27,21,289,127,85,245,271,154,277,285,294,122,3,337,139,329,10,65,137,248,173,166,272,151,43,196,327,320,69,288,258,205,254,261,291,282,250,48,238,117,216,223,218,36,97,158,209,67,235,45,199,142,109,259,185,138,29,201,91,59,257,24,167,325,207,99,225,177,15,214,66,283,105,162,243,132,81,219,64,23,246,195,224,273,14,9,74,100,169,136,208,251,121,227,183,308,89,58,147,332,60,331,268,128,304,141,231,222,296,115,310,26,174,170,31,197,42,80,150,57,336,62,215,297,264,252,52,0,38,104,236,140,6,28,306,35,123,181,256,228,226,47,295,323,156,276,68,212,106,108,311,247,242,278,83,114,17,49,253,286,317,186,244,33,40,92,146,316,191,4,241,281,107,229,135,322,13,210,133,129,160,178,313,318,175,321,56,82","199,132,110,72,113","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
62,"I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.","Ever since I was a little boy, I had always dreamt of owning a house. I always fancied the idea of a beautiful backyard with colorful flowers and lush green trees. It would be a place where I could create my own little world, undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city life. 

Fast forward a few years and I found myself living in a high rise apartment, in the heart of the city. Contrary to my dreams, it was a far cry from the lush green backyard and tranquility I had so often pictured. To add to my woes, I was now sharing the apartment with two other roommates.

Don't get me wrong, they were great people and we got along quite well. However, the persistent lack of privacy and the incessant noise levels were certainly not something I had anticipated in my dream of home ownership. But then again, life doesn't always happen the way you plan it. 

As my mother would say, ""Beggars can't be choosers."" It was a saying I never quite understood as a child but was beginning to grasp now. I didn't have the means to afford a house in the current economy, and thus I had to compromise.

Every day, I would return from work to a cacophony of sounds; the laughter, music, and mundane chatter of roommates, which was far from the tranquil silence I yearned for. I didn't have the luxury to walk barefoot on cool grass or read a book in silence in the backyard. 

It wasn't all bad, though. We shared good times and had hearty laughs. The camaraderie and friendship developed over shared meals and late-night conversations were remarkable. We divided chores and shared expenses, which made life a lot easier on our wallets.

I still found moments of solitude and peace within this shared space. I would wake up early in the morning, before the others, and savor a cup of coffee while looking at the cityscape from our tiny balcony. That was my moment of tranquility, my tiny slice of solitude.

Still, the longing for a house of my own never completely disappeared. A place where I wouldn't have to share or adjust. A place where I could truly be myself. But until then, I would continue living with my roommates, sharing our lives, our joys, and our problems. 

After all, I wasn't exactly in a position to be picky, and as they say, beggars can't be choosers. But it wasn't the end of the world, I supposed. The future held potential, and with it, the hope of fulfilling my dream of having a house of my own.","104,231,85,89,212,171,29,152,311,290,120,146,207,233,65,48,47,167,239,221,8,310,333,13,313,169,274,250,188,174,283,44,280,242,32,176,136,307,164,126,329,214,34,11,108,22,46,237,211,141,192,3,148,177,145,15,114,216,142,64,186,87,77,86,71,179,228,331,78,295,157,226,259,303,94,251,222,69,264,36,83,182,139,112,100,235,184,90,102,247,106,199,39,300,24,96,137,195,258,97,286,103,324,256,189,291,318,105,17,150,151,31,299,156,197,129,306,187,335,229,296,309,149,121,67,144,193,79,234,5,111,198,26,254,215,262,173,278,225,72,113,61,154,66,28,138,232,252,275,319,63,166,260,315,55,282,140,245,332,170,116,132,191,41,56,42,196,74,0,263,12,14,54,80,2,246,265,206,43,68,101,323,338,172,249,317,35,298,84,304,51,339,123,261,76,219,118,308,25,91","151,60,15,144,125,180,78","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
63,"That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.","In life, we all have tastes and preferences that we adhere to religiously. I am a woman of principle and I usually never settle for less when it comes to my style. The simplicity of the cuts and the elegance of solid colors are usually my go-to; I’ve always loved understated sophistication. However, the universe seemed to be testing my tenacity. I had lost my job recently and most of my savings were drying up, faster than I ever imagined.

On a day filled with self-pity and brooding, a knock on the door interrupted my spiraling thoughts. It was Karen, my ebullient neighbor, always equipped with stories that were as loud as her colorful attires. Today, she was carrying a large, flamboyant dress in her arms. She had won it in some radio contest and upon hearing that it was too grandiose and flashy for her taste, she thought of me. “Lily,” she said, “you will rock this like nobody else.”

The dress was bright orange with erratic splotches of pink, purple, and gold and cascading ruffles that made it larger than life. I groaned inwardly, as it wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself. I mean, my style was about as far as possible from Karen's love for theatrical splashes of color.

Regardless, she insisted and in the face of my financial constraints, I had no choice but to reluctantly agree. After all, it was free and my savings were running dangerously low, even for basic necessities, let alone a new dress.

With a sigh of surrender, I took the dress from Karen and thanked her for her kindness. My mind wandered to the upcoming dinner party at my cousin's home. A gathering I had been dreading due to my inability to afford anything new to wear.

With a glass of cheap wine in hand, I stared at the bright monstrosity hanging on my closet door. A wave of ridiculousness washed over me as I tried to visualize myself in it. After a lot of contemplation, I decided to give it a shot. I slipped into the dress, cringing at the gaudy colors against my skin. 

Nevertheless, I dared to look into the mirror. To my surprise, the dress didn't look as bad as I imagined. It was exuberant, flamboyant, and completely out of character for me, but it somehow seemed to work. It hid my frugality behind its ostentatious appearance.

Maybe this was exactly what I needed - a deviation from my mundane life, a burst of color during a gray period, a message from the universe that sometimes it’s okay to embrace the unexpected and step out of our comfort zones. It was certainly not the dress I would have picked for myself, but hey, it was free, and for a broke woman like me, it was no less than a savior from the heavens.","5,243,169,256,64,213,160,38,179,327,211,49,1,308,247,10,4,31,86,237,283,37,149,56,30,66,14,39,279,265,175,78,164,276,240,333,336,101,20,62,290,291,210,224,170,23,280,2,3,288,75,60,85,236,267,302,254,296,65,287,208,233,263,202,44,16,114,135,206,9,68,183,19,320,259,54,241,316,25,127,59,15,70,43,319,90,282,298,163,303,82,80,306,249,227,232,46,137,74,73,88,122,337,7,8,93,270,105,190,84,156,222,89,12,338,315,200,275,144,109,33,36,331,103,32,69,230,257,219,107,255,301,113,310,253,133,29,176,293,87,329,220,61,177,100,106,268,52,216,323,40,321,245,228,157,136,201,326,71,214,165,162,244,97,294,48,125,317,124,58,76,117,26,143,50,27,110,53,218,91,108,51,141,104,147,297,234,67,281,77,47,209,79,185,167,332,111,324,18,92","40,5,59,26,188,71,126","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
64,"I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.","Once, I had a crucial meeting scheduled with a potential investor for my startup, but my car had broken down the previous night. I was quite desperate as this meeting had potential to be a game-changer for my business, and missing it was not an option. Remembering that my neighbor Joe owned a bicycle, I decided to swallow my pride and ask for his help. 

Walking up to Joe's door, I rehearsed the request in my head, trying not to sound too desperate. I knocked and waited, feeling a knot in my stomach. Joe opened the door, greeted me with his warm smile, and invited me in. We chatted a bit about the weather, our jobs, and our respective plans for the weekend. 

Eventually, I took a deep breath and asked him if I could borrow his bicycle for the day. Joe looked surprised for a moment, but agreed immediately, disappearing into his garage to fetch it. When he finally re-emerged, my heart dropped a little at the sight of the bicycle he was pushing towards me.

It was an old, rusty one that looked like it hadn't been used for years. My mind started racing, questioning if it would even make it to the meeting point. The tires were slightly deflated, the handlebars were covered in rust, and the seat was cracked, revealing bits of faded foam. 

I turned to Joe, who looked apologetically at me. He told me that he had meant to fix it up or replace it, but just hadn't gotten around to it. With a sigh, I accepted his old, rusty bicycle. Although it wasn't the ideal solution, I had no other option.

Slowly but surely, I set off towards my meeting. The bicycle creaked and groaned under my weight. Pedaling required much more effort than it should have due to the rusty chain and deflated tires. It was a tough ride, but I was determined. 

The meeting was a success, thankfully, and the investor agreed to fund my startup. However, every time I look back on that day, I am reminded of the old, rusty bicycle that got me to my meeting on time. And in a way, I am grateful to Joe and his worn-out bicycle, for it became a symbol of my determination and my willingness to do whatever it took to make my startup succeed.","259,144,70,100,102,60,13,314,201,4,214,308,233,134,29,68,237,323,171,119,22,174,66,297,85,83,264,304,14,124,16,152,278,306,216,63,97,42,40,211,219,187,115,282,313,118,168,245,75,74,294,27,286,24,2,227,163,5,332,177,244,131,95,333,328,90,149,126,250,272,158,274,188,105,62,82,218,292,339,130,120,93,289,195,153,267,46,89,196,312,110,169,36,300,79,178,7,189,175,33,69,239,140,318,9,271,226,58,185,173,180,1,137,87,17,112,143,257,329,255,38,39,135,315,116,273,71,129,43,172,111,330,224,155,324,148,225,288,217,113,162,207,215,154,96,199,23,266,142,183,241,104,25,150,253,310,284,57,108,80,147,301,164,125,236,298,190,186,230,319,94,281,307,269,53,161,243,67,280,109,77,194,285,45,30,200,167,212,20,322,287,181,262,106,197,31,291,65,327,198","75,36,198,23,178,16,101","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
65,I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.,"As the sky began to grow dark and blend into a beautiful kaleidoscope of oranges, pinks, and purples, I found my stomach starting to growl. There was a familiar scent in the air - the enticing aroma of freshly cooked food wafting from various eateries in my vicinity. I yearned to go out, to sit at a table and enjoy a warm meal. As I stood there, absorbing the sounds and scents of the bustling evening, a particular restaurant caught my eye, its windows beaming with an inviting light.

This restaurant was nothing extravagant, but it was a place that had a certain charisma about it. The golden glow from the wooden interior, combined with the laughter and the clinking of dishes from inside, only amplified my desire. I could almost taste the savory richness of their homemade gravy, the tangy zest of their salads, and the tender, juicy meat that had been marinated to perfection.

However, I was quickly yanked back to reality as I reached for my wallet. The barren leather folds confirmed my predicament - I was flat broke. I was faced with the stark reality that such a dinner, as enticing as it was, was currently beyond my means.

This left me standing on the sidewalk with an empty wallet, staring longingly into the restaurant. I sighed and slowly turned away, heading back to my modest apartment. In my pantry, I knew what awaited me; the cold, bland remnants of the meal from last night. 

The rice was left-over from an attempt to cook a somewhat wholesome meal for myself. It was a monotonous affair - plain, boiled rice. I remembered how I had disappointedly picked at the meal last night, the tastelessness amplifying my solitude.

Walking back home, I couldn't help but feel a little dejected. The tantalizing aromas from the restaurant still lingered in my senses, making the prospect of left-over rice even less appealing. However, there was no other alternative.

I arrived at my apartment and was welcomed by the cold, eerie silence. In my small kitchen, the left-over rice waited for me, a stark reminder of my circumstances. I heated up the rice, the only sound in the quiet apartment being the hum of the microwave.

Once heated, I sat at my small dining table, looking at the white grains of rice. The enticing aroma from the restaurant was replaced by the bland, starchy smell of the reheated rice. I took my first bite, the taste even more lackluster than I remembered.

Despite my situation, I couldn't help but chuckle a little at the contrast of my current dinner to the one I had envisioned at the restaurant. Life had a funny way of grounding us and teaching us humility. Today, it seemed, was one such lesson for me.

Even though the dinner was not grand, I appreciated that I had something to eat. As I finished the last spoon of the rice, I made a silent vow to myself. I would work harder, not just for the extravagant dinners, but to ensure I could lead a comfortable life.

That evening, the taste of the left-over rice was a stark reminder of where I was and where I aspired to be. It served as a wakeup call and a motivational push towards my goals. As I cleared my plate, I realized the value of dreams, determination, and the sustenance even the plainest of meals can provide.","310,274,258,104,290,256,80,42,19,31,320,172,91,330,179,69,296,29,312,62,95,329,66,158,319,17,22,298,72,163,267,282,144,134,85,166,39,139,98,127,99,120,237,206,109,314,301,235,132,34,30,154,316,71,222,226,200,6,7,33,79,86,75,251,105,61,81,265,135,63,297,182,24,128,161,55,233,307,266,230,48,300,78,119,73,159,337,180,118,218,234,173,268,2,299,241,67,321,47,146,283,196,138,32,1,156,14,64,124,291,40,202,191,270,38,211,23,244,35,217,289,325,255,205,317,108,231,169,245,5,178,193,292,219,262,188,3,204,15,215,101,333,90,46,94,186,216,286,264,165,175,197,103,269,4,249,305,107,26,113,184,10,302,243,129,93,225,213,331,106,311,149,100,240,238,272,261,56,187,9,223,18,115,228,152,239,0,236,133,195,58,68,254,143,13,275,87,59,57,287","20,70,108,23,97,192,16","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
66,Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.,"Mary had always loved animals, especially dogs. Over the years, she had rescued several strays and taken them into her loving home. It was a small house, but Mary made it work. 

Her latest rescue was a big German Shepherd, who she affectionally named Bear due to his large size. Now that she had Bear, she had six dogs, all ranging in size. Mary was overjoyed with her furry family, but she realized that she needed to provide them with a larger shelter outside her house.

She approached her husband Peter with this idea, expressing her need for a big dog house. Peter was supportive but pointed out their financial constraints. He worked as a carpenter and while he had the skills to build a wonderful dog house, buying the materials required would leave a dent in their savings.

This did dishearten Mary a bit, but she was determined. She remembered about the large cardboard boxes in their storage room. She started thinking about how she could use them to build a big dog house.

Peter was initially skeptical of the idea, but Mary's determination won him over. So, they ventured into the storage room together, dusted off the old boxes, and got to work. They folded, they cut, they reinforced the cardboard with duct tape. 

Peter's experience as a carpenter came in handy as he expertly cut the boxes into neat pieces to make the walls and roof of the house. Mary managed the assembling and reinforcing part. They both shared laughs and stories as they worked, turning the project into a bonding moment.

After a few days of hard work, they finally managed to build a big cardboard dog house. It was surprisingly sturdy and spacious. Mary painted it with leftover paint, adding a touch of her creativity, while Peter ensured the structure was safe and secure.

Once the paint dried, Mary introduced the dog house to her beloved canines. Bear took an immediate liking to the house, followed by the others. They all seemed to love their new abode and it brought a tear to Mary's eyes seeing them so happy.

Despite not being able to afford the typical wooden dog house, Mary had managed to fulfill her dream with a cardboard alternative. Peter admired his wife's determination and creativity, realizing they had turned a problem into a priceless memory.

Leaving my comfortable life back home, I was optimistic about carving out a niche for myself in the chaotic and bustling city. The city seemed to be a perfect cocktail of my dreams and aspirations.

In my early days here, I barely knew a soul. Starting from scratch in an unfamiliar environment was intimidating. But the spirit of adventure that led me here also helped me brave the challenges. 

I began to search for a place to stay. What I had initially imagined as a cozy apartment ended up being a cramped one-room space that I could hardly afford. That’s city life, people said, and I consoled myself with their seemingly sage advice.

Arriving with just one suitcase, there were numerous things I didn't possess. The most evident one was a bed. Yet, I managed to find comfort in the limited means available to me. The scarce pieces of furniture in the apartment consisted of a weathered bookshelf, a wooden table, and a worn-out but still useable sofa.

While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the city's living room for now. Yes, it's not as comfortable as a mattress. Yes, it's not wide enough to toss and turn. Yes, the springs occasionally prod my back. But it's something, and that's all that matters.

Some nights, I reminisce about the queen-sized bed I had back home. The soft duvet that covered me, the fluffy pillows that cradled my head, and the sense of security that surrounded me. Yet, I don't let myself spiral into a well of self-pity.

I remember the very reason I came to the city - to make a life for myself. The sofa that I sleep on reminds me of the struggles I've willingly taken on. It keeps me grounded, reinforcing my resolve to work harder.

Slowly but surely, I've started to settle into my new life. The strange city that once seemed intimidating is gradually becoming my home. The people no longer strangers, the streets no longer confusing mazes. I'm making friends, exploring new avenues, and even growing to appreciate the harsh realities of life.

I know that someday, I'll be able to afford not just a bed, but also a spacious apartment in the city. However, for now, I'm content with my humble beginnings. I'm comfortable with sleeping on the sofa in the living room, embracing the challenges, and relishing every step of this journey. Because I know, this struggle is my stepping stone to success.","80,297,9,136,179,137,4,128,263,162,124,14,331,173,241,116,214,182,299,161,229,211,51,33,260,320,141,326,250,191,75,301,113,49,29,98,223,54,274,334,220,152,64,312,317,249,265,167,123,66,31,205,217,272,41,42,111,327,16,165,55,5,6,252,247,226,225,218,39,126,268,251,79,190,77,3,122,28,87,37,121,188,224,287,17,145,291,65,148,92,203,139,194,96,44,26,246,23,227,328,210,295,8,192,60,278,20,273,336,69,22,68,255,248,200,322,48,144,303,242,298,212,283,325,95,307,239,232,45,285,180,286,159,284,112,160,335,97,215,318,84,288,109,93,332,146,135,231,62,89,296,103,34,18,228,127,306,300,281,61,308,21,108,119,36,166,243,294,236,293,178,78,25,197,129,105,183,63,168,56,149,172,267,235,0,155,206,333,185,24,73,321,339,101,40,7,324,233,151,106","149,178,43,88,50,112,110","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
68,"By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.","In the small, tight-knit community of Eastwood, lived my best friend, James. For as long as I could remember, he was always the life of the party, a free-spirit with an infectious laugh and a generous heart. Never having a care in the world, he lived life at his pace, keeping happiness as his North Star. 

The house that he lived in was an ancestral property, passed down from generations. A beautiful old colonial style edifice, the house was more than just a structure of brick and mortar. It was a symbol of his legacy, an emblem of his roots. He loved that house, as it held countless memories of his childhood, family gatherings, and the peaceful solitude of adulthood. 

As James grew older, he took up several ventures to sustain his carefree lifestyle. He had his fingers dipped in several businesses, from clothing boutiques to trendy bars and even some tech startups. There were times when he hit jackpots, only for his uncontrolled spending habits to blow it all away.

He had always been a dreamer, a risk-taker, the kind of person who goes all in when he believes in something. However, his impulsive decisions and poor management led to significant financial losses. His world of affluence quickly took a downturn, leaving him in a sea of debt. 

By that time, my friend James was broke. His once promising businesses had all but crumbled, leaving him nothing but vast expanses of unpaid bills and arrears. It was a sad sight to behold; watching someone once so full of life now reduced to financial hardships. 

His circumstances had taken a toll on him. His jovial demeanor had turned grim, and his infectious laughter was replaced with a strained silence. But life needed to go on, and he had to think about survival above everything else.

James didn't have many options left; he had to take extreme measures. The unthinkable happened. He had to sell his house, his beloved ancestral property, the one thing he never imagined he would ever part with. The decision tore him apart, but he had no other choice. 

The whole town watched in sadness as 'For Sale' signs went up on the once lively home. It seemed as if an era had come to an end in our small community. However, amidst all this, James managed to put up a brave front. 

Looking back, James's fall from grace served as a lesson for everyone in our small town. His story was a chilling reminder of how easy it was to lose everything due to mismanagement and reckless decisions. But it also underscored the importance of resilience, the will to fight back and start anew even when circumstances seem dire.","192,138,252,326,82,172,75,185,79,299,84,266,20,145,262,125,19,272,318,154,238,44,232,306,325,137,168,269,221,307,103,225,90,195,278,324,267,194,298,39,216,94,170,48,337,190,153,162,112,244,217,54,178,156,57,114,282,28,293,334,241,296,339,64,42,58,271,86,36,183,193,228,301,122,289,129,223,159,65,303,30,164,181,46,261,280,151,12,310,211,220,141,200,135,292,333,169,305,69,11,189,17,283,40,155,247,6,117,182,109,8,107,243,87,21,134,209,176,140,251,146,63,108,188,329,203,259,276,10,320,24,110,88,335,239,202,43,163,31,204,302,240,171,235,96,152,128,37,113,34,215,91,187,218,270,322,106,281,71,32,317,56,67,126,277,286,331,98,50,47,62,104,201,132,323,66,9,275,179,321,206,199,119,111,256,254,197,116,167,242,97,231,173,309,16,127,13,315,115,248","171,122,64,79,176,163,99","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
69,"After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.","In the midst of the war-ravaged landscape, a unit of fifty brave soldiers stood resolute, ready to battle for their homeland. However, they were horribly outmatched and outnumbered, facing a monstrous force of enemy soldiers that seemed endless. They fought valiantly, shedding blood, sweat, and tears on the sun-baked battleground. 

Their captain, a tough but fair man named Edward Hawkins, had led his men through countless battles. He had always managed to turn the tide of war in their favor, using strategy and tactics rather than brute force. But this time, it was different. The opposition was too strong and too vast, their artillery a deathly rain against Hawkins' unit. 

In the ferocious heat of the battle, they lost half of their soldiers. Young and old, brothers in arms, they fell one by one, their lives claimed by the relentless onslaught. Despair clutched the hearts of the surviving soldiers as they watched their comrades fall. A palpable sense of defeat started to set in.

Hawkins, seeing the hopelessness reflected in the eyes of his men, knew they were running out of options. There was one thing left, one final card they could play. Parked a fair distance away was their last hope - a colossal and fully armored tank. 

With a heavy heart, he made the painful decision. They had no other option but to use the tank to fight. Summoning the rest of his soldiers, Hawkins carefully outlined the strategy for their last stand. His calm voice steadied the wavering spirits, infusing them with renewed determination. 

Corporal James, their best driver and shooter, was assigned the vital role of maneuvering the tank. He approached the monstrous machine with a grim determination, the weight of his fallen comrades fuelling his resolve. Stepping into the tank felt like entering another world, away from the death and destruction outside. The soldiers watched James climb into the tank, their hope riding with him.

The roar of the tank's engine erupted through the silent battlefield, cutting through the chilling air. James steered the war machine to the front lines while Hawkins rallied his remaining soldiers to cover him. They moved forward, a band of unyielding spirits making their final stand. 

The tank proved to be their lifeline, plowing through enemy lines and decimating their artillery. James unleashed the full might of the tank, honoring the fallen through each booming shot. The enemy began to falter; their seemingly unstoppable force was crumbling against the lone tank and the resolute soldiers. 

The battle reached its climax with the tank at the heart of the action. Their fight was not easy or without loss, but their will to fight was undying. Their fallen comrades were not forgotten, and their sacrifice fueled the soldiers’ courage. The battlefield was where they faced the harshest realities of war, but it was also where they discovered the depth of their bravery and camaraderie. In the face of overwhelming odds, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight. And fight they did, never backing down, never giving up. Their determination and courage spoke volumes of the human spirit, of their loyalty, and of their belief in the cause they were fighting for.","255,87,163,305,214,296,243,203,322,210,56,125,40,124,245,62,252,337,254,316,57,25,27,334,314,51,195,130,176,92,54,24,247,267,265,103,126,209,199,259,187,12,99,118,32,83,115,73,294,109,174,272,175,177,319,77,34,260,15,295,162,256,264,181,318,332,6,327,140,280,41,333,47,297,49,218,67,192,207,170,331,329,132,120,29,180,142,286,172,228,106,4,233,72,317,37,154,102,278,66,104,183,39,178,279,144,100,330,250,315,60,223,78,211,202,253,238,249,184,84,42,196,89,64,86,128,164,14,91,166,117,116,302,98,10,200,161,179,282,68,284,244,94,287,119,156,221,136,65,189,46,123,63,160,43,237,135,113,328,217,146,155,291,277,18,21,129,194,33,208,293,227,229,339,173,289,307,114,38,266,131,313,90,290,311,13,309,230,97,338,336,191,71,201,16,19,159,20,204,274","16,153,124,149,100,77,140","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
70,"As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.","As the old adage goes, every cloud has a silver lining. This belief rang true for our protagonists, George and Isabel, in the most unexpected of ways. Their journey began when they had missed their scheduled flight, an incident that at the moment felt like a colossal disaster. They were supposed to be on a direct flight to Hawaii for their honeymoon, but fate had other plans. If we hadn't missed the plane, George thought, we would be sipping cocktails on a sunlit beach by now.

Instead, they were stuck in the bustling Denver airport, trying to rearrange their plans. They were upset, frustrated, and drowning in disappointment. As they sat brooding in the bustling terminal, an unfamiliar voice pulled them out of their melancholy.

""Excuse me,"" the voice said. They turned to find a man, probably in his sixties, grinning broadly at them. His eyes twinkled with an infectious optimism. The man was Martin, a Denver local who had taken the liberty to approach them seeing their visibly downcast demeanor.

Over coffee, Martin regaled George and Isabel with stories of his youth, the places he'd been, the experiences he'd had. They found themselves drawn in by his infectious energy. His stories painted a vivid image of a life lived to the fullest, an existence drenched in experiences and a constant zeal for adventure.

Before they knew it, hours had passed. Martin had inadvertently reminded them that life was too short to get bogged down by setbacks. Their sour mood had evaporated, replaced by a newfound appreciation for the unexpected paths that life could take.

It was then that Martin suggested a day trip to the Rocky Mountains, a place close to his heart. Hesitant at first, George and Isabel eventually conceded. What were they to lose? Their Hawaii plans were already derailed.

The next day, they found themselves amidst the picturesque landscape of the mountains. Nature's serenity worked its magic on them as they marveled at the sights and sounds that the mountain had to offer. They never imagined they would experience something like this on their honeymoon.

Spending the day with Martin made them realize how much they had benefitted from missing their flight. Their unexpected detour had opened their eyes to the beauty of spontaneity and unpredictability. They had gained an unforgettable experience and, more importantly, a lifelong friend.

They thanked Martin for the wonderful day and as they said their goodbyes, they thought, if we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you. The missed flight had morphed from a disaster into a blessing in disguise. It proved true; every cloud does indeed have a silver lining.","42,317,239,174,277,267,208,73,222,63,231,71,92,282,324,195,314,211,95,24,61,243,303,19,237,54,136,130,114,85,59,202,338,246,258,35,263,125,328,100,16,274,151,271,39,159,254,121,147,252,175,333,179,217,163,155,188,111,272,251,22,25,108,285,226,68,308,221,4,268,278,119,12,123,209,117,186,18,250,318,337,336,126,138,11,143,325,199,1,270,242,311,91,177,105,37,15,116,45,191,99,218,206,94,112,44,284,72,34,43,74,265,2,183,135,321,238,58,200,290,60,6,302,240,323,335,306,304,124,228,96,102,20,224,329,41,50,17,229,52,259,256,233,160,38,334,57,313,30,203,176,332,320,297,33,291,132,189,120,131,137,255,273,13,106,286,234,327,23,269,154,104,75,312,21,301,168,309,197,276,310,315,322,98,296,190,142,128,172,145,14,7,244,194,264,173,275,161,146,149","12,108,8,111,173","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
71,"Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.","My sister, Emily, has always been famous for her culinary exploits. She can create a banquet out of just about anything. We all knew that for our brother, Charlie's birthday party, she was planning on bringing her signature dish - a seasoned roast chicken that is out of this world. Charlie had specifically requested it, already savoring the thought of that crispy skin and tender, juicy meat. The anticipation was high, as we knew we were in for an extraordinary gastronomic treat.

However, fate had a different plan. Emily, the ever-organized planner, forgot the chicken at home. As she drove to our parent's house, where the party was to take place, she realized her mistake. We could see the frustration on her face when she arrived, her hands empty. The delicious chicken, perfect in every way, was sitting on her kitchen counter, forgotten in the frenzy.

She apologized profusely to Charlie, who to be honest, looked somewhat disappointed. I could feel a wave of sympathy washing over everyone. The star dish of the evening was missing, a void that seemed impossible to fill. However, Emily, being the quick thinker that she is, immediately began rummaging through our mom's pantry. She had an alternative plan.

While the rest of us continued our chatter and laughter, Emily was busy in the kitchen. She was confident and undeterred, despite the initial setback. The aroma of garlic and herbs soon filled the air. Before we knew it, she emerged from the kitchen with a huge bowl of pasta. It wasn't what we expected, but the mouthwatering smell made our stomachs growl in anticipation.

The pasta was divine, coated in a creamy, rich sauce, studded with sauteed mushrooms, fresh herbs, and generously sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. The first bite itself was enough to send us into a state of bliss. There was an instant applause, everyone praising Emily's culinary prowess. Even Charlie was beaming, his disappointment completely forgotten.

Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made. It turned out to be an evening full of surprises, each one better than the last. The roast chicken might have been the anticipated star, but the pasta indisputably stole the show.

Emily's spontaneous pasta not only saved the day but gave us a delightful memory that we would cherish for years. We all decided that Emily's pasta should now become a tradition at our family gatherings, right along with her famous chicken.

72,It is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.,"On Friday, after a long day of work, I bumped into you at the local cafe. You mentioned how you were looking forward to attending Dave's house party that evening. The thing is, this was no ordinary gathering. Dave was known for throwing the wildest, most insane parties in the neighborhood. However, you had your concerns. There were whispers that the last party Dave threw had spiraled out of control. Anyway, we chatted for a while about it before going our separate ways.

As I walked home later that evening, I noticed how the quiet suburban streets were slowly but surely transforming. The tranquil evening was giving way to the telltale signs of an impending party, with young people flooding into Dave's house. Music was pulsating through the walls of his property, hinting at the raucous affair inside.

Your decision to back out at the last minute, worried about the potential outcomes, had left you with a sense of regret. You were pondering whether or not you were missing out on a great time.

However, as the night descended and the party was in full swing, there came a sudden, unexpected turn of events. The blaring sirens cut through the music and the laughter, silencing the rowdy crowd. My heart raced as I peered through my curtains, watching the scene unfold.

From the safety of my house, I saw how the police cars pulled up outside Dave's house. One by one, people were being escorted out of the house, some laughing nervously, others visibly upset. The loud music was replaced by the stern, authoritative voices of the police officers, and Dave was among those who were left standing in the street, looking sheepish and worried.

The once vibrant party scene had quickly become a chaotic mess of accusations and blame. Parents started to arrive, angry and disappointed, collecting their wayward children. And then, there were those whose night ended with a ride in the police car rather than their own.

As dawn broke over the neighborhood, the echo of the previous night's pandemonium lingered. Pieces of discarded party supplies littered Dave's yard and the immediate surroundings. The stern visage of our neighbors, clearly upset by the disruption to their peaceful night, was a grim reminder of the night's event.

That's when I texted you, ""It's good that you didn't get to go to the party. I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble."" While you missed out on what was initially promised to be a night of fun, you escaped the drama and the repercussions that followed. Sometimes, missing out isn't a bad thing at all.","51,70,82,309,258,89,111,150,16,73,52,88,318,151,238,106,33,278,133,137,158,264,32,217,39,182,46,331,45,252,83,327,186,19,35,296,223,209,232,198,228,79,230,169,213,294,316,284,241,94,54,92,319,168,21,242,174,44,280,184,123,250,335,136,222,216,49,36,286,135,166,265,261,60,200,227,211,321,312,26,66,55,80,259,162,118,102,85,116,127,53,58,190,41,24,103,28,297,25,23,219,268,56,270,74,274,225,339,269,239,295,14,248,167,214,71,114,59,20,40,8,124,9,164,314,247,11,64,244,291,192,159,153,81,302,7,125,196,95,189,105,149,140,90,148,30,249,65,303,298,177,208,338,191,262,299,204,76,311,287,165,75,43,160,328,96,290,0,205,293,152,84,266,113,170,254,121,336,108,275,31,220,157,99,101,272,6,22,147,119,175,156,325,134,313,130,15,306,139,117","2,116,10,105,162","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
73,But if you look at the bright side you got to learn so much from the experience.,"James had always been a go-getter, fiercely dedicated to his dreams. Ever since he was a little boy, his dream was to create his own tech start-up. After years of hard work and saving every penny he earned, he finally managed to invest in his start-up.

However, it wasn't a smooth sailing journey as he had expected. He experienced major setbacks, lost some significant deals, and even found himself on the brink of bankruptcy. He was disillusioned, frustrated, and began questioning his choices.

One day, while feeling absolutely low, he received a call from his old school friend, Benjamin. Benjamin, now a successful entrepreneur himself, had heard about James's plight and wanted to offer support. They met up for a coffee, where James narrated his struggles and failures.

Listening patiently, Benjamin said, ""James, I understand how hard it is for you right now. You've hit rock bottom and it seems like there is no way out.""

He paused for a moment before continuing, ""But if you look at the bright side, you got to learn so much from the experience.""

James frowned, failing to understand his point. Seeing his confusion, Benjamin explained, ""Every failure, every setback that you've experienced is a lesson. It has helped you understand the market better, learn how to manage finances and most importantly, you now know what doesn't work for your business.""

James remained silent, mulling over Benjamin's words. He realized he had indeed learned a lot. His mistakes had made him wiser, and he began to see the silver lining.

In the following days, James started to look at his failures with a different perspective. Each stumbling block became a stepping stone, each mishap a lesson learned. He began to improvise his strategies, made informed decisions, and implemented better management and financial practices.

Slowly but surely, his start-up began to recover. He won some small deals initially and eventually secured a major contract that helped stabilize his company's financial position. Gradually, his start-up gained traction and was back on the success track.

James often looked back on his troubled times, grateful for the learning curve it provided. Each failure and setback had indeed been a priceless experience, shaping him into a better entrepreneur. He learned the hard way that sometimes the journey to success can be rocky and tumultuous, but each bump along the way comes with its own set of learning experiences. 

After all, it was these hardships that made him who he was, a successful entrepreneur, the proud owner of a flourishing start-up, and most importantly, a man who had learned to see the bright side of every failure.","265,1,225,242,300,236,36,113,194,11,160,215,248,312,281,63,81,29,164,116,237,285,20,18,330,97,9,220,78,279,47,247,171,75,310,319,141,283,61,60,204,338,227,294,5,185,200,280,276,45,98,59,336,307,74,143,184,102,175,44,296,72,324,48,216,49,188,193,166,246,69,249,148,124,149,104,329,315,121,207,179,167,273,131,214,311,328,224,161,127,32,261,56,70,90,292,176,14,168,162,264,190,110,19,122,275,323,86,50,198,34,38,223,79,322,209,253,226,222,278,95,252,12,239,85,27,82,109,262,254,192,137,274,205,42,31,186,57,251,16,183,101,245,304,240,152,172,84,10,37,219,318,71,83,107,189,155,146,28,258,111,53,320,58,180,94,154,233,126,39,327,174,25,232,150,129,139,202,334,218,266,159,201,170,54,157,250,100,135,91,133,306,0,120,112,88,134,187,290,41","94,153,62,55,34","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
74,"Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.","Before the fire, life was simple but good. My name is Henry, a humble carpenter from the outskirts of New York City. I lived alone in a small wooden cabin that I built myself, situated on the edge of a serene forest. I had my workshop in the backyard, where I spent my days building furniture and crafting pieces of art from blocks of wood. It wasn't a lucrative life, but it was peaceful, and I was content.

One fateful night, tragedy struck as an unexpected fire ravaged through my cabin. I was barely able to escape with my life, let alone any of my possessions. The devastating fire left me with nothing but the clothes on my back. My beautiful cabin, my workshop, all my tools, furniture, all turned into ashes within a matter of hours. 

In a desperate attempt to find a fresh start, I decided to move away from the haunting memories of my old life. With a small loan from an old friend, I ended up in Arkansas, a place I knew nothing about. 

Life in Arkansas was drastically different. The rustic life was much slower and more close-knit than the one I was used to. I found work as a local handyman, fixing things around the town and even building some furniture for a few kind folks. It was a humble life, not much different from the one I led before the fire.

One day, on a whim, I decided to buy a lottery ticket from the local store. I had never been one to gamble, but something about the simplicity of choosing a few numbers appealed to me. I thought to myself, ""Why not? What have I got to lose?"" I quickly picked a few random numbers and handed over the few spare bucks I had. 

Days turned into weeks, and soon enough, the day of the draw arrived. With no expectations at all, I gathered with a few friendly faces at the local bar where the announcement would be televised. As the numbers were called out one by one, my heart began to race - they were matching my ticket. By the time the last number was announced, I was in utter shock. I had won the state lottery.

Suddenly, I was no longer just Henry, the carpenter-turned-handyman. I was Henry, the multimillionaire. The win turned my life around, but it didn't change me. I decided to continue my passion for carpentry, but on a larger scale, turning it into a lucrative furniture business. 

Even though I lost everything in the fire, moving to Arkansas turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The state welcomed me with open arms, became my second home, and gifted me with a fortune I never thought I would have. Life took an unexpected turn, but in the end, I wouldn't have had it any other way.","2,124,239,153,183,268,281,64,186,85,205,84,215,63,336,225,24,330,87,163,107,337,4,275,229,204,157,6,325,71,173,158,241,201,116,326,49,0,335,148,135,265,35,306,233,244,321,184,88,152,226,99,287,19,298,266,41,119,39,303,260,1,332,21,302,150,254,185,296,78,122,250,16,174,172,14,270,82,83,294,70,289,251,207,220,141,217,138,38,26,243,45,23,316,331,134,127,300,240,274,283,171,125,20,236,257,53,13,222,60,140,297,202,285,75,193,269,37,73,72,50,190,181,293,231,272,27,133,114,304,165,267,57,309,291,299,32,199,228,261,324,327,104,79,200,206,175,253,259,62,178,314,168,101,308,100,68,224,110,30,121,108,211,52,5,167,86,256,77,89,147,189,255,164,311,263,93,160,328,279,18,187,69,12,132,118,120,151,66,91,166,213,142,162,25,196,333,65,315,203","81,30,120,119,115","1, 6, 10, 16, 18, 25, 28, 35, 38, 43, 49, 53, 56, 62, 67, 73, 78, 82, 83, 85, 93, 94, 95, 98, 100, 106, 108, 114, 116, 119, 122, 123, 124, 127, 135, 136, 138, 141, 143, 144, 146, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
75,"The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.","Leonardo was a painter, notable for his vibrant, dreamlike landscapes and portraits. He was not just any painter, but a renowned one, popular throughout the city of Florence. His paintings graced palaces and public buildings, illustrating his magnificent talent. One day, he was commissioned by a wealthy duke to paint the grandeur of a summer sunrise.

The duke was peculiarly specific about the details he desired. ""Yellow,"" he had said, ""Make it as golden as the morn itself."" Leonardo readily agreed. However, when the time came to begin work, he discovered a problem that he hadn't anticipated. His palette was missing the crucial color - the bright, beautiful yellow that would bring the sunrise to life. He was aghast, searching around his workshop for a discarded tube of paint that he could use. Yet it was in vain, the yellow hue was nowhere to be found.

Instead of panicking, Leonardo assessed the situation. He could have sent for a new tube of paint, but that would have delayed his work significantly. Another option was to mix several colors he had to mimic a version of yellow, but he quickly dismissed that idea. It could alter the final visual effect of his painting. 

While he could have taken either of these routes, Leonardo chose another. He decided to embrace the challenge and step out of the boundaries of conventional painting. He realized that necessity often became the mother of invention. 

Looking over his color palette, his eyes rested on a bright and fiery red. This was not the soft glow of a summer sunrise, but the passionate blaze of a sunset. Intrigued by the potential, he decided to use red instead of the demanded yellow. 

His confident strokes filled the canvas with a brilliant, unconventional image. The crimson radiated against the quieter shades, creating a bold contrast. Onlookers would feel the intensity of this sunrise, one that echoed with vitality and warmth.

When he finally presented the painting to the duke, the room fell silent. The duke gazed at the fiery sunrise, initially stunned by the audacious choice. Yet, as he studied it further, he found himself captivated by the unexpected, but breathtaking perspective.

As word spread about the painting of the 'Red Sunrise', Leonardo's reputation soared even higher. Art enthusiasts thronged to see this controversial masterpiece. His unconventional choice of red over yellow had brought him immense fame. Leonardo's painting was much admired for its courage and innovative spirit, confirming him once again as one of Florence's finest painters.","60,111,108,97,95,270,22,250,329,11,217,100,174,234,241,16,66,143,331,338,284,265,189,285,51,322,48,62,74,301,49,313,263,183,94,279,202,316,117,269,327,215,277,27,47,109,242,200,226,176,20,15,211,309,209,311,151,166,99,110,156,17,173,227,197,216,88,314,264,192,44,0,123,203,236,195,221,58,207,271,335,184,41,81,65,73,103,13,177,129,76,266,141,290,2,332,220,36,299,154,63,71,224,274,186,317,187,210,170,296,79,1,307,218,18,50,105,289,246,107,40,126,213,45,96,101,146,133,102,150,205,310,225,180,64,272,149,230,288,144,147,326,127,134,259,59,3,268,319,182,293,315,206,163,260,167,298,247,68,235,328,115,238,77,320,53,80,23,128,155,204,249,83,69,116,240,32,72,252,98,28,292,179,152,8,219,280,181,169,26,70,140,201,89,330,253,302,120,159,131","191,102,178,86,29","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
76,A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a vast country, lived a young man named Eros. Eros had always dreamt of visiting the world beyond his humble hometown. He would spend countless hours imagining what he would see, whom he would meet, and what life could be like out there. But, he always remained paralyzed by the distance, the unknown, the fear. 

Eros loved the simplicity and serenity of his village, but his heart yearned for adventure. ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,"" said his wise old grandfather one day. His words struck Eros profoundly; it was as if a spark ignited in his heart. 

Eros thought about it all day and all night. By dawn, he had come to a decision. Determined, Eros decided to overcome his fears and step out of his comfort zone. He realized that the journey of a thousand miles he'd always dreamt of, could indeed start with a single step. 

His family, while concerned, saw the gleam in his eyes and knew they couldn't stop him. Eros packed his backpack with necessities, bid farewell to his family and friends, and set out on his adventure, thus making his first step towards the thousand-mile journey. 

As he travelled, every step he took brought him closer to his goal. He realized the world was much bigger, more diverse, more beautiful and more challenging than he had ever imagined. He met people from different cultures, tasted foods he had never heard of, and faced challenges he never dreamed of. 

Yet, despite the challenges, he continued. Every new day was an opportunity to learn and grow. Each encounter, each discovery, and each difficulty was a stepping stone towards his destination. Eros's thousand-mile journey expanded his perspective, character, and heart. 

He encountered storms and sunshine, hills and valleys, despair and hope. Each step Eros took, whether it was up a mountain or across a river, brought a new experience that shaped him into a stronger, more resilient person. 

As he walked the final mile, he looked back at the journey he had embarked on. He was not the same person who had taken that first single step. His eyes shone with wisdom, his heart was filled with courage, and his soul was filled with unshakable determination. 

The journey of a thousand miles had indeed begun with that single step out of his village. Eros realized that every adventure, big or small, begins with the courage to take that first step. And he also knew that he would never hesitate to take the first step ever again.

77,We all begin our lives as a baby and slowly learn and grow.,"We all begin our lives in a state of innocence and wonder. Each one of us, without exception, starts our journey as a small, fragile baby, a delicate bundle of joy wrapped in blankets and adored by everyone around us. We are born into this world with a clean slate, a tabula rasa, devoid of knowledge but filled with the potential to learn and grow.

In our infancy, we perceive the world purely through our senses. The murmur of voices around us is a soothing lullaby that puts us to sleep, the soft touch of a mother's fingers on our skin brings comfort, and the twinkling stars in the night sky, a source of endless fascination. Yet, we are unable to comprehend the world in all its complexity, for our minds are not yet equipped with the tools of understanding and reasoning.

Then, as we transition into toddlerhood, our curiosity about the world around us begins to take shape. We start to discover our own little universe, probing everything that falls into our tiny grasp. Colors and shapes begin to make sense, words start to form meaning, and gradually, we grasp the foundations of our language.

We slowly learn to walk, each falter and tumble a step forward on our journey of growth. The world starts to become a playground for us, full of exciting opportunities to explore and experiment. Our senses become sharper, our minds more curious, and our hearts more courageous.

Entering school-age, we embark on the formal process of learning. We are taught the skills that would equip us to navigate life's future challenges - reading, writing, arithmetic, and much more. Our classmates become our first friends, our teachers our mentors, shaping our perspective and worldview.

Our teenage years bring about a myriad of changes, both physically and mentally. It is a period of self-discovery and self-expression, where we develop our unique identities and carve out our place in the world. We begin to form our belief systems, influenced by our experiences, friends, families, and the world at large.

Into adulthood, our lives get more complicated. We face the pressures of careers, relationships, and responsibilities. However, it is also during this time that we can truly realize our potential, with the wisdom gained from our years of growth and learning.

As we age, the cycle of life continues. We might become parents and guide our own babies through this wondrous journey of learning and growing. We reflect on our lives, savoring our accomplishments, learning from our failures, and continually growing till our last breath.

Every stage of life presents a unique learning curve, a chance for personal growth. Indeed, it's a never-ending process. We all begin our lives as a baby and continue to learn and grow, expanding our understanding and evolving, until the end of our days. Life, in essence, is a beautiful journey of eternal learning and constant growth.","37,161,339,34,181,90,91,48,253,315,128,88,207,238,193,85,286,25,42,102,220,245,328,242,271,22,300,215,80,117,302,310,79,10,98,188,120,108,66,54,130,81,96,240,160,270,180,309,231,9,53,210,16,174,59,84,294,67,139,252,147,170,237,262,258,30,266,166,223,45,222,134,265,28,268,209,149,50,292,198,172,83,229,285,218,288,249,24,176,184,126,18,151,75,39,19,153,65,289,110,164,239,35,212,95,101,36,20,183,332,224,92,119,186,162,13,143,72,261,100,41,137,318,159,204,141,293,327,107,254,168,167,316,158,313,8,86,15,283,314,260,93,87,301,69,163,194,155,273,228,334,236,306,219,244,319,308,115,44,78,157,206,196,106,296,282,233,182,76,17,287,213,256,73,217,247,94,205,325,138,226,203,330,278,214,290,58,303,179,56,202,57,124,150,3,235,250,55,326,4","169,160,33,29,42","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
78,"By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms.","Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lucy who had a fascination with computers. She was intrigued by how they worked and had a burning desire to learn how to code. She had heard that coding was a way to instruct computers, and it was akin to learning a new language. She wanted to be able to speak this language fluently and use it to create incredible applications.

Lucy decided to embark on a journey to understand this programming language. She knew it was not an easy feat, but she was willing to give it a shot. The first step she took was to write simple codes. She began by learning the basic syntax, the rules and structure of the language.

She started with the basic 'Hello World' program. It was a simple code, designed for beginners, that merely printed the words 'Hello, World!' on the computer screen. Despite its simplicity, Lucy felt an immense sense of achievement. Her first baby step in the coding world had been successful.

She continued to write simple codes for basic operations, gradually becoming comfortable with the language. She became proficient in using loops, arrays, and functions. As her comfort with coding grew, so did her confidence. She started spending more and more time coding, working late into the nights, driven by passion and curiosity.

With time, Lucy began to realize a pattern in coding. She understood that most complex codes were simply a combination of simple codes. This realization was a revelation for her. She was more determined than ever to master complex coding. Her world was beginning to revolve around algorithms, logic, and code optimization.

After months of constant practice, Lucy started writing more complex codes. She started solving problems on online coding platforms. She was thrilled when her solutions were accepted and ran successfully. She was beginning to master the art of writing complex algorithms. 

Lucy also started participating in coding competitions. Her ability to solve intricate problems using complex algorithms improved significantly. She worked on different kinds of problems, each one challenging her coding skills to a new level. She felt alive with each problem she solved, each code she wrote.

She realized that by starting with simple codes, she had gradually built the foundation to write more complex codes. Her journey was far from over, she still had much to learn. But she had made significant progress. She was closer to mastering the art of coding complex algorithms than she had ever been before.

Her story serves as an inspiration to many aspiring coders. It emphasizes the importance of mastering the basics before diving into the complexities. By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms, just like Lucy did. She proved that persistence, practice and a profound understanding of the basics can take you a long way in the world of coding.","267,51,58,123,24,120,136,73,77,263,253,183,141,304,145,203,16,208,299,57,31,128,147,142,218,248,259,201,199,328,181,49,236,275,72,55,37,292,143,164,234,225,188,4,217,126,180,325,67,92,150,296,118,119,329,197,70,250,62,91,50,190,293,173,103,115,245,82,212,289,163,320,288,175,0,322,291,287,168,29,266,193,174,155,319,21,314,1,282,206,53,257,160,98,100,114,238,10,221,205,63,202,47,33,308,19,167,2,109,227,312,132,191,327,177,74,232,121,23,64,54,305,156,224,260,315,8,79,60,113,210,154,43,194,273,61,274,220,316,317,170,108,158,244,290,106,144,69,39,125,107,330,246,255,169,172,52,178,95,281,7,81,116,138,241,35,339,195,15,229,300,75,176,104,38,303,80,83,231,307,30,96,242,247,251,279,278,42,68,65,137,277,32,86,235,12,223,222,76,269","199,9,128,177,162","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
79,Her atheltic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world class athelete.,"Once, there was an ordinary girl named Lisa who lived in a small town in Kansas. Lisa was always seen as a shy girl by the locals, never demonstrating any particular interest or talent. Life changed for Lisa when she turned sixteen and first visited the local gym. At that time, Lisa's parents wanted her to join the gym because they were concerned about her health.

Her athletic career started with her first visit to that gym. She was drawn towards the rhythm of the place; the clattering weights, the humming machines, the disciplined regulars, and the aura of sweat-soaked determination. Lisa fell in love with the vibrant world of physical fitness. This new-found passion caught the eye of the gym's personal trainer, Sam. He saw potential in her, and believed that she could excel if she dedicated herself to training.

He coached her every day, pushing her to exceed her limitations. Lisa diligently followed her training schedule, never missing a single day. As the days turned into weeks and then months, Lisa started transforming, not only physically but also mentally. The timid girl from Kansas was becoming a beacon of strength and dedication. 

Her consistent efforts began to pay off as she started achieving recognition in local competitions. She did not stop there. Her aspirations grew with every victory and every defeat, she learned something new. Lisa began to branch out, participating in state and then national tournaments. 

Lisa's determination and hardwork eventually led her to become a world-class athlete. Her journey was not only inspiring but also a testament to her unyielding spirit. Now, she travels across the globe to compete against top athletes. 

Yet, despite her success, Lisa always remains true to her roots. She never forgets that small gym in Kansas where her journey began. She has become a role model for countless girls who dream of breaking barriers in the world of sports. 

She finds immense joy in encouraging young talents in her hometown, and often visits her first gym, where it all began, to share her knowledge and experiences. And even after achieving so much, Lisa never rests. She keeps practicing, learning, and growing, because her journey as an athlete is not just about winning, it's about relentless pursuit of betterment. 

She never looked back after that first visit to the gym, and is proud of the road she has taken to become a world-class athlete. Her story is a beautiful illustration of how an ordinary girl became extraordinary by following her passion and never giving up. Lisa has truly become an inspiration for everyone in her town and beyond.","295,95,124,330,298,197,243,184,133,129,49,290,87,12,182,82,47,265,41,329,70,326,309,249,164,251,274,247,96,210,222,98,327,65,29,139,278,160,187,27,110,226,300,236,277,162,83,153,328,8,24,286,239,279,117,282,1,315,189,270,185,93,203,84,186,314,34,273,36,16,55,267,121,138,257,238,137,269,195,216,244,100,116,42,7,78,18,332,113,261,109,336,68,151,284,312,166,335,240,44,174,250,3,319,156,23,230,271,46,280,17,299,183,89,80,204,43,169,145,231,67,157,143,234,242,158,313,51,148,37,246,333,94,177,152,14,69,76,322,207,215,48,268,334,25,311,147,77,325,175,19,30,54,26,75,0,39,297,150,64,104,171,108,66,103,191,59,35,331,60,241,22,201,310,237,102,73,292,2,123,337,128,13,254,181,301,5,339,130,81,192,120,291,105,199,190,167,263,40,85","138,148,86,115,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
80,The process of quiting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking.,"At 43, John realized something must change. He had been smoking since his late teens, enjoying the allure of rebellion and the illusion of sophistication. But now, with the specter of middle age looming and the persistent cough interrupting his life, he acknowledged that the process of quitting smoking must commence. He was fully aware that it was not going to be an easy task, and it would require massive determination.

John knew that the process of quitting smoking starts with a sincere desire to quit smoking. The understanding was clear in his mind, yet the craving for the nicotine clung to him like a second skin. He would need more than a simple understanding or a vague wish; he needed a forceful, all-consuming desire to stop, a desire powerful enough to overcome the entrenched habits of a lifetime. A longing that could weather the storm of withdrawal symptoms and fight the behavioral patterns attached to smoking.

He started by vocalizing his intent, telling his friends and family about his decision to quit smoking. They were supportive, of course, providing him with encouragement and praise for his decision. Some even shared their own stories of struggle and eventual triumph over the deadly habit. Their experiences served as a beacon of hope, strengthening his resolve to quit.

Next, he sought professional help. His doctor provided him with a variety of resources: nicotine patches, prescription medications, pamphlets on coping mechanisms, and even suggested joining a support group. He welcomed all this information, seeing it as tools to assist him in his quest. 

He also began to change his lifestyle. John started jogging in the mornings, aiming to strengthen his weakened lungs and distract himself from the cravings. He replaced his coffee and cigarette routine with a cup of herbal tea and meditation, hoping to instill healthier habits.

During the initial days, the cravings were cruel and persistent. The withdrawal symptoms—headaches, irritability, and insomnia—pulled him back towards the cigarette pack. But he held on to the image of a healthier, smoke-free future, gritting his teeth and riding out the discomfort.

The most surprising aspect of his journey was the emotional turmoil. He had underestimated how much he had relied on cigarettes to manage stress, anxiety, and boredom. But he sought healthier coping mechanisms, learned to handle emotions without the crutch of nicotine. 

Slowly but surely, the grip of nicotine began to loosen. His cravings became less intense, and his health started to improve. His family and friends continuously showered him with love and affirmation, their support unwavering throughout.

Finally, a year passed and John was still smoke-free. It had been a grueling journey and far from over, but he remained resolute. He had begun the process with a desire to quit smoking, and that desire had transformed into a successful reality.

81,"As someone with social anxiety, joining the debate club many years ago led me to become a powerful and persuasive public speaker.","As a teenager, I was a person crippled by severe social anxiety. The mere thought of speaking in front of a crowd was enough to send me into a cold sweat. Every social situation felt like an ordeal, with nerves wreaking havoc on my composure. It was so bad that I would practice conversations in my head before engaging in them. 

Out of sheer desperation to overcome my anxieties, I found myself joining the high school debate club. This was many years ago, yet the memories are vivid. Looking back, I realize it was an act of raw courage. Being part of this club meant I had to confront my fears head-on, rather than hiding behind them.

In the beginning, it was, quite frankly, a nightmare. My heart would pound out a deafening rhythm, my palms would grow slick with perspiration, and I’d stumble over words. I remember my first debate, as I stood awkwardly on the podium, I was a bundle of nerves and stuttered through my opening statement. 

However, I was lucky to have a club advisor who understood my situation and worked with me to practice my speeches, offering constructive criticism. She worked diligently with me, helping me to organize my thoughts and harness my words to articulate them clearly. I still remember her telling me, “It’s not just about the content, it’s about delivery too.”

To gain further mastery, I devoted hours to rehearsing in front of the mirror, working on my diction, tone, and body language. I studied famous speeches, and the more I immersed myself in the world of debate, the more I fell in love with the power of language and the art of persuasion.

With every debate, I noticed a shift in myself. My voice grew more confident, my arguments more structured, and my delivery more impactful. The shyness began to shed away, replaced by a newfound confidence. The stage was no longer a place of fear, but a platform for expression. 

Seeing my transformation, other club members started coming to me for advice, looking up to me as a mentor of sorts. It was a validation that spurred me to work even harder. 

Many years have passed since then, and looking back, I can trace my evolution back to that debate club. That club was the catalyst that turned me, a socially anxious teenager, into a powerful, persuasive, and confident public speaker. 

Now, I can command a room and inspire a crowd. I channel my once crippling anxiety into the energy that fuels my speeches. All of those years of hard work, perseverance, and raw courage have paid off in a way I never imagined possible. Today, I no longer fear social interactions, but rather, I embrace them. This is a testimony to the fact that the most significant challenges can indeed lead to the most powerful transformations.","332,219,22,129,204,244,101,69,24,25,173,229,285,143,169,272,329,139,40,304,189,13,63,149,174,58,259,159,207,115,54,282,312,192,306,202,339,213,183,122,103,246,62,124,105,32,111,133,53,127,226,87,257,92,216,29,196,130,18,319,83,284,66,185,248,80,56,110,37,208,64,318,31,205,233,4,27,294,328,179,100,172,278,2,91,76,88,311,198,333,107,230,11,232,15,141,59,1,220,305,120,287,180,20,267,119,16,275,26,289,157,234,235,256,3,182,292,211,145,253,128,194,186,223,296,74,131,286,243,217,151,10,165,171,79,314,245,271,240,274,154,152,209,98,252,102,181,288,228,30,210,263,167,221,293,77,86,17,215,112,203,247,218,321,193,14,301,135,57,166,175,150,280,225,326,206,265,158,70,212,44,78,214,34,96,307,90,298,297,291,148,23,55,126,264,200,250,116,85,9","86,156,182,135,66","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He was of average looks, mid-thirties, with a wiry frame developed from years of manual labor. Samuel was a simple man; he believed in straightforward principles of life. The most significant among them was that people work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.

Samuel was content with his life as a gardener. He had a small house with a large garden where he grew different varieties of flowers and vegetables. He was single and lived with his old, faithful dog, Max. Samuel was known in the town for his mesmerizing garden, which gave him enough to survive comfortably. Therefore, he never aspired for more wealth or fame.

For the ambitious townspeople, this was an opportunity to earn a significant fortune and impress the mayor. They began to exhaust their resources in an attempt to win, trading peaceful nights for strenuous days. 

However, Samuel remained unperturbed by the ongoing frenzy. People found it odd that Samuel, the best gardener in town, showed no interest in the contest. They urged him to participate, convinced he had the best chance at winning. Samuel merely smiled at their enthusiasm, reminding them of his belief.

Then came a turning point. Max, Samuel's companion, fell sick. Samuel took him to the town's vet, who diagnosed Max with a serious condition, requiring immediate and expensive treatment. Samuel was disheartened. His current earnings were not enough to cover the cost of Max's treatment. Samuel saw himself facing a difficult situation. His simple and content life suddenly seemed insufficient.

For the first time, Samuel felt a burning necessity for something more. With renewed determination, he decided to participate in the garden contest. It wasn't for personal gain or recognition anymore; it was about saving his beloved companion. He worked tirelessly, day and night, making the contest a mission rather than a competition.

People observed a drastic change in Samuel. His unending commitment to the garden reflected the urgency and necessity that had ignited his determination. They realized the truth behind Samuel's principle that people work their hardest to attain something only when it's necessary for them.

The day of judgment arrived, and unsurprisingly, Samuel won. His garden was unparalleled in its beauty and charm. The prize money was enough to cover Max's treatment, securing a second chance for his dear friend. Samuel’s belief was reaffirmed - necessity indeed pushes individuals to their greatest potential.","77,157,339,243,233,303,181,83,47,256,92,253,276,331,189,131,302,76,222,244,208,28,143,160,45,129,288,197,295,326,22,320,79,56,19,151,40,106,311,147,54,263,318,120,117,100,96,215,321,145,325,155,229,194,337,162,25,282,116,48,219,322,94,205,36,249,267,306,99,29,224,292,63,35,213,149,154,286,115,196,52,152,179,74,315,183,87,105,273,13,309,101,1,6,7,112,73,30,125,252,308,140,317,42,265,18,41,144,75,2,204,216,89,212,327,34,180,290,103,141,24,187,333,164,274,248,203,81,90,37,174,0,16,14,97,69,289,228,86,71,49,119,195,324,58,153,33,20,293,323,269,335,21,169,206,5,296,182,281,258,270,85,4,95,59,170,251,336,304,10,210,135,260,226,46,134,294,225,171,190,172,275,121,113,259,163,192,150,332,84,166,137,139,173,223,175,70,319,62,3","8,190,162,139,87","1, 8, 60, 81, 141, 175"
83,If my project partner hadn't gotten sick I never would have need to finish the entire assignment on my own by working day and night.,"My project partner, Jason, and I were paired up by our professor for a major end-of-semester project. This project was worth 60% of our final grade, so its significance was not something we took lightly. We divided the work evenly and had everything planned out meticulously. I thought we would be able to complete it smoothly. 

However, one Monday morning, Jason didn't show up for our regular project meeting. His usually lively seat was painfully vacant. At first, I assumed he was just running late, but then I received a call from him. His voice sounded weak and feeble on the other end of the line. He shared with me that he had been diagnosed with mononucleosis and was told to rest for a couple of weeks. 

My heart sank. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I wished him a speedy recovery but inwardly, I was in a complete state of panic. The next thing I knew, the whole weight of the project was on my shoulders. If Jason hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to finish the entire project on my own.

I began dedicating all my time to this project. My days and nights soon became a blur of research papers, calculations, and simulations. I stopped hanging out with friends, watching movies, going for my usual evening walks - everything took a backseat. My only focus was to finish this project on time. The only sounds in my apartment were the tapping of my keyboard and the occasional groan of frustration. My dining table became a workstation covered in papers, snacks, and lots of coffee cups. 

With each passing day, the pressure started mounting. My initial panic slowly turned into a grim determination. As I struggled to put everything together, I started gaining a better understanding of the project, an understanding I might not have gained if I had been working with Jason. I realized I was learning more and developing stronger problem-solving skills. 

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I finished the project a day before the due date. Looking at the final work, I felt a wave of satisfaction wash over me. Despite all the stress, sleepless nights, and constant pressure, I had managed to complete it all by myself. Yes, I was alone, but in the end, the experience made me stronger and more self-reliant. If Jason hadn’t gotten sick, I would have never uncovered this strength within me.","98,147,104,149,309,52,106,26,37,243,280,195,254,101,212,59,87,269,262,12,313,246,94,146,314,73,71,105,181,114,150,255,169,295,248,174,164,224,328,297,207,82,208,123,312,318,121,265,191,2,96,75,276,99,256,91,55,305,330,223,89,15,155,267,21,112,97,138,179,113,127,266,307,194,264,161,34,136,301,335,137,311,177,294,325,156,300,180,210,54,189,20,274,261,162,209,76,25,221,190,84,290,63,86,122,292,134,140,41,310,144,220,13,319,250,178,218,18,273,49,235,205,249,299,322,143,192,171,271,68,74,19,241,70,166,196,6,215,62,197,283,278,159,151,33,78,284,206,233,230,217,64,234,67,173,48,324,329,117,193,3,240,5,289,214,291,157,203,116,333,85,277,225,132,258,42,275,286,11,44,170,61,263,31,293,148,27,316,259,69,201,304,260,60,232,198,303,17,30,16","42,101,171,104,17","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
84,"Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.","Normally, I'm the kind of person who strives to maintain a healthy balance between my personal life and my work life. My principles include valuing my own time, setting boundaries between home and office, and ensuring that I have ample time for leisure and personal development. However, an extraordinary situation occurred last week that pushed me to break all these rules. I had five deadlines to meet, all in the span of seven days, and the failure to meet any one of them would have grave consequences.

This was no ordinary week; the typical 9-to-5 routine was not an option. I had to finish a financial report, an audit, a strategic plan, an annual budget, and a grant proposal. Each of these tasks was crucial for the company's growth and stability. Therefore, it wasn't a question of if I could miss any, but rather how I could possibly manage to complete all of them.

I spent the entirety of Sunday outlining my strategy. I divided each task into smaller, manageable goals and set up a schedule that demanded almost every waking hour of the next seven days. Although I was stressed, I was determined to fulfill my responsibilities.

Monday arrived, and so did my first task: the financial report. I began the day fueling my body with a strong cup of coffee, and then plunged headlong into the figures and charts. By the time the sun went down, I had put in a solid 14 hours of work, but the report was complete.

On Tuesday, I turned my focus to the audit. This work required more attention to detail and a meticulous examination of our books. Through endless cups of coffee and numerous breaks only for necessary sustenance, I finished the audit late into the night.

Then came Wednesday and the strategic plan, my most feared task. This was a new area for me, and I needed to be both creative and logical. It was a test of my stamina and intellect, but by dawn on Thursday, I'd cracked it.

I started Thursday, sleep-deprived but fueled by a sense of achievement, on the annual budget. I hunched over spreadsheets and calculators, inputting figures, and making projections. A second sleepless night followed, but Friday morning, the budget was ready.

Finally, on Friday, I began work on the grant proposal. With the weekend ahead, I allowed myself to slow my pace slightly, but not much. By Sunday evening, as the sun set, I sent off the final document.

I had worked non-stop, with little sleep and practically no time for anything beyond work. The following week, I decided to take some days off to recover from my exertion. I remembered my original principle: to maintain a good work-life balance. However, that extraordinary week taught me that sometimes, in pursuit of excellence, one might need to stretch beyond the comfortable, while always remembering to bounce back.","99,240,252,114,83,232,285,41,64,331,113,276,279,308,39,32,47,111,108,23,167,265,170,277,152,5,13,268,98,260,45,203,150,227,194,190,130,283,85,198,318,123,46,21,82,238,189,81,19,218,59,295,12,28,289,299,332,109,132,212,210,129,328,278,193,315,180,326,192,124,195,10,333,145,261,175,324,30,320,197,307,271,172,168,224,89,275,186,110,244,141,9,25,125,239,211,182,158,259,96,181,228,91,293,87,162,302,282,51,334,178,3,294,26,17,247,306,229,209,20,154,235,135,1,40,142,151,7,73,250,77,313,339,11,18,122,36,33,280,188,155,146,120,177,327,213,79,86,74,245,169,29,115,119,27,314,93,60,231,153,2,112,300,164,137,202,237,179,56,37,310,6,49,88,311,309,301,106,38,136,44,248,184,204,101,329,338,117,234,219,144,62,319,126,163,274,216,15,303,173","45,5,39,148,105","1, 5, 13, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
85,Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.,"At the tender age of twenty-two, Sally was a vibrant young woman, brimming with optimism and dreams. She had always enjoyed the company of her family, especially her only sibling, Tom, who was two years older than her. They were close, sharing a bond that only siblings could comprehend, their jokes and laughter filling their home with warmth.

One tragic evening, an unforeseen calamity fell upon their happy family. Tom, on his usual route back home from work, was involved in a car accident. The news reached them like a bolt of lightning, too shocking to be true. Tom's demise was a severe blow to their family, leaving them in immeasurable grief.

Sally found herself reeling, grief and confusion clouding her mind. It was challenging to comprehend the situation, to accept that her beloved brother was no more. Her heart ached, the pain almost unbearable, making each moment feel like a year. The home that used to be filled with laughter suddenly seemed drearily silent. Yet, amidst all this, she remembered the promise she and Tom had made to each other – to be there for their parents no matter what.

She glanced at her parents, their faces stricken with pain and grief. Their spirits were completely shattered, the light of their life snuffed out in an instant. That sight made her realise she had a tremendous role to play. She needed to be the support they needed during this challenging time, even though she was equally broken.

Gradually, Sally started to gather her strength. She took a deep breath, holding back her own tears and putting on a brave face. No longer was she just Sally, the younger sister. She had to step up and be the pillar, the sturdy backbone her parents needed in their old age.

In the ensuing days, she spent most of her time with her parents. She cooked their favourite meals, watched old family videos with them, and listened as they reminisced about Tom's childhood. Sally made sure she was present in every possible way, proving to be a source of solace in the unbearable grief.

She helped them navigate through the mundane everyday chores, hiding her own pain behind a smile. Whenever her parents broke down, she would comfort them, saying, ""Tom is always with us, watching over us.""

Seeing Sally stepping up to the role, her parents gradually started to regain some of their lost strength. They found solace in her presence, and her words of comfort began to provide them with a glimmer of hope. The weeks turned into months, and slowly but surely, Sally helped them navigate the rough seas of despair.

The responsibility of supporting her parents did not dampen Sally's spirit. Instead, it made her stronger, braver, and resilient. Amidst the waves of grief and sorrow, Sally was indeed the beacon of hope and the pillar of support her parents needed after their son's untimely demise. The pain of losing Tom never faded, but together, they found strength in each other. Their shared memories and love for Tom helped them survive the ordeal, making them realise that he was indeed alive in their hearts.","109,10,245,38,107,213,156,243,303,39,258,129,127,267,335,152,221,104,51,93,201,115,274,307,164,153,200,248,36,166,132,61,259,320,255,14,125,291,70,118,285,305,28,247,33,66,163,275,251,52,308,63,226,332,144,141,87,288,49,174,4,56,313,286,252,283,310,130,239,172,65,146,11,263,318,116,5,168,316,97,37,157,218,91,268,207,142,180,199,205,13,112,338,98,140,334,282,331,297,162,148,30,22,209,333,84,319,89,123,202,50,229,113,238,298,19,154,8,171,295,60,67,299,173,59,1,77,301,182,40,126,317,9,25,75,214,217,228,293,280,339,169,262,76,155,222,190,83,279,195,74,32,261,90,265,326,120,178,330,81,300,69,260,227,26,289,58,237,175,42,231,27,101,149,304,198,82,187,161,191,253,57,309,176,47,292,204,96,121,122,158,86,327,114,23,20,277,212,220,95","177,148,106,192,57","1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100"
86,David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager and scrambled to setup the new system from scratch.,"David Thompson, an introverted computer programmer in a thriving tech firm, found himself facing a challenging situation. His lethargic approach to tasks, coupled with his indifferent attitude, had not sat well with his manager, Roger. Consequently, David was at risk of receiving poor reviews on his work ethic. He was aware that negative feedback from his manager could jeopardize his career at the firm, so he decided to change the narrative.

Reeling from a stern warning received from Roger, David took on the task of setting up a new system for the firm - a challenging project that nobody else was keen on. Aware that doing this from scratch would present the perfect opportunity to redeem himself, David rolled up his sleeves and plunged headfirst into the project.

Over the next few days, David immersed himself in the task with determination. He researched the new system intensively and drew plans meticulously. Assembling a small, but a dedicated team to assist him, he worked late hours, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to the task at hand. His team noticed a stark change in his attitude; where there was once indifference, there was now dedication.

On some days, David would feel overwhelmed by the scale of his task, but he reminded himself of the importance of his mission. He recognized the need to prove his worth to his colleagues and, most importantly, to his manager. He realized that his professional reputation was at stake and he had no room for errors.

Weeks passed by. Under David's leadership, the new system was gradually taking shape. He corrected minor glitches along the way and spent hours ensuring that the system was foolproof. His once doubting colleagues now looked at him with newfound respect. They were impressed by his work ethic and dedication, a far cry from his lackadaisical attitude of the past.

Finally, after countless days and sleepless nights, David and his team successfully set up the new system. The day he'd been working so diligently towards had finally arrived. His colleagues lauded him for his hard work and perseverance. More importantly, his manager, who had initially doubted his capabilities, was now singing praises.

David's transformation had not only saved him from receiving bad reviews but also earned him a recognition he'd never expected. All along, he was capable of great things; he just needed the right motivation to unlock his potential. His story served as a reminder in the office that there was always room for growth and improvement. Nobody remembered the old David, as he became an inspiration to many in his firm.","292,167,148,218,154,177,233,72,135,109,291,42,25,113,111,106,234,88,159,204,83,332,256,270,224,259,165,33,110,31,29,116,149,90,63,283,198,160,321,257,185,302,32,313,246,146,333,143,226,162,334,279,171,96,239,254,266,66,335,242,197,319,176,183,252,56,318,230,9,65,179,227,115,191,178,184,134,271,309,85,52,284,123,43,258,307,247,53,102,69,222,16,170,275,297,10,168,26,267,304,84,281,207,59,27,235,130,120,39,87,131,296,232,24,127,128,141,300,305,311,122,277,236,248,157,289,44,316,0,262,48,186,144,93,140,216,237,34,264,145,153,274,12,189,62,298,150,15,22,136,251,303,7,132,293,294,126,238,253,40,125,217,163,229,77,278,249,255,70,269,17,312,82,329,117,268,287,223,142,201,119,94,89,2,68,181,243,263,58,245,64,221,101,61,158,3,6,323,5,190","173,21,101,80,110","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
87,"Megan, a lousy student, worked twice as hard and revised her basics once she was told to mentor two new members of the team.","Megan was a lousy student in her past. Unlike her peers, she struggled to get by in her classes. She found it challenging to stay focused, to understand the principles, and to memorize what she was taught. She was always seeking to get out of her academic responsibilities, somehow just skating by. Despite this, she had a caring heart and a charismatic personality which were the main reasons she was popular among her peers and teachers.

Years later, after battling her way through academics, Megan landed a job in a reputable company. Her charm and dedication helped her fit in perfectly. She made some good friends, worked on exciting projects, and was quite content with her life. But her past had left a dent in her capabilities, which would come back to haunt her.

One day, Megan's boss called her into his office. He assigned her a new task, one that would require her to step out of her comfort zone. Megan was told to mentor two new members who had recently joined their team. Her initial reaction was pure panic. Mentoring was one thing, but being responsible for the basics of these new team members was a daunting task. 

Despite her fear, Megan resolved to rise to the challenge. She was determined to overcome her past and prove to herself that she was capable. And so, she started working twice as hard. She revised her basic principles, studied the methodologies, and brushed up on her company’s procedures. She spent long nights reading, understanding, and practicing, so she could pass on the correct information to her mentees.

It was tough, but Megan was relentless. She found herself, for the first time, enjoying learning. The satisfaction she got from finally understanding concepts and the joy of teaching these to the new members was a feeling she had never experienced before. 

When Megan finally began mentoring the newbies, it was clear that her hard work had paid off. Not only did she help them understand the basics, but she also gave them practical knowledge and shared her personal experiences. The new members were impressed with Megan's knowledge and dedication, acknowledging her as a helpful mentor.

In the end, the experience transformed Megan from a lousy student into a diligent mentor. She proved to herself and others that it is never too late to learn and grow. While she had always been known for her charisma, Megan now gained recognition for her diligence and dedication as well. As for the new team members, they were glad to have a mentor like Megan, someone who taught them not just work, but also the importance of constant learning and hard work.","98,325,61,174,183,82,185,222,88,85,279,188,25,286,126,146,302,317,224,313,273,295,86,141,232,253,173,9,291,116,16,112,29,323,281,58,237,272,187,260,103,163,33,283,67,338,143,289,122,69,152,120,81,252,105,56,76,137,196,153,158,312,48,228,22,198,36,324,261,47,93,305,175,28,89,230,213,77,284,95,50,84,264,119,318,134,172,23,300,145,121,128,307,24,91,315,255,54,157,219,216,46,74,51,179,218,100,242,282,309,32,316,83,271,45,27,127,217,60,177,107,328,149,197,35,296,129,193,249,144,13,190,111,70,247,220,7,330,20,170,102,310,6,240,97,266,15,244,113,92,285,34,55,334,108,208,212,63,301,333,57,267,287,139,138,101,12,176,133,155,297,290,306,241,14,39,154,201,233,90,68,181,147,274,322,245,64,140,194,246,321,162,299,226,336,278,4,320,339,275","6,113,82,10,23","1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
88,It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.,"Once upon a time in the quiet town of Sopley, everyone lived by the old adage, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" The people were generally kind-hearted and considerate of each other's feelings. However, one day, a new family moved into town. The Carters were unlike any of the people in Sopley. 

Jake, the head of the Carter family, was an ambitious and cunning man. He and his family were infamous for their unscrupulous actions in their previous town. Soon, he brought his nefarious ways to Sopley. Jake was of the belief that if someone else did a bad thing, it was acceptable for him to do the same. 

When Jake's neighbor, Mr. Reynolds, accidentally damaged Jake's fence with his lawnmower, Jake took this as an opportunity to retaliate. Without wasting any time, he knocked down a section of Mr. Reynolds' beautifully manicured hedge, justifying his action by what Mr. Reynolds had unintentionally done. 

Mrs. Johnston, the town's elderly and wise woman, observed Jake's actions. Disheartened by the violation of the town's peaceful existence, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She called an urgent meeting of all the town's folks at the central square. 

""Friends,"" she began her speech, ""we have always lived together in harmony, respecting each other's rights and properties. However, it seems that this peace is being threatened.""

She then narrated Jake's recent actions. The crowd listened in stunned silence, unable to believe such negativity had crept into their peaceful town. Mrs. Johnston then declared, ""It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.""

The townspeople nodded, understanding the importance of her statement. They knew that responding to wrong with another wrong would only create a cycle of negativity, disturbing the peace and serenity of their town. The moral lesson resonated with them.

The next day, Mr. Reynolds, showing a great deal of courage and decency, repaired Jake's fence without saying a word. The other townsfolk followed suit, showing acts of kindness to the Carters. The Carters, in turn, were surprised by the unexpected kindness showered upon them.

Over time, Jake slowly began to understand the value of positive actions over negative retaliation. He realized that doing a bad thing just because someone else had done it was not the solution. Instead, responding with kindness and understanding was the way forward.

By embodying this principle, the town of Sopley had not only maintained its peace but also taught a valuable lesson to its newest members, changing them for the better.","117,196,115,217,283,334,315,302,271,73,266,133,24,250,23,131,216,208,11,222,26,179,214,205,202,263,235,316,125,162,323,92,249,41,101,313,172,242,260,31,279,335,247,81,290,153,127,25,328,259,43,320,246,50,5,36,30,184,52,201,150,204,321,138,332,226,116,44,318,2,93,18,225,151,19,123,329,277,312,219,338,47,288,262,199,282,106,227,198,96,8,229,120,128,178,122,146,135,70,114,45,118,197,188,284,143,183,257,158,239,113,86,326,3,310,16,309,85,324,258,213,107,102,21,210,255,83,203,163,297,79,240,221,278,308,273,253,62,154,103,145,331,230,136,167,141,51,333,174,144,132,58,159,243,77,209,173,108,322,206,71,245,155,48,49,305,301,139,84,91,300,100,298,192,289,295,164,231,303,299,265,291,293,13,67,89,241,336,311,294,76,9,325,165,53,248,90,152,126,175","186,197,170,32,71","1, 5, 16, 18, 22, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
89,"You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.","Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, there was a young, ambitious reporter named Harold. He had recently graduated from Columbia University and had joined a renowned media house, ""The Manhattan Chronicles,"" as a junior reporter. A man of integrity and wisdom beyond his years, Harold held the power of the pen in high regard.

He believed that it was his duty as a journalist to enlighten his readers with the truth, rather than feeding them a diet of gossip and rumors. He loathed the sensationalism that had crept into the journalism industry, where rumors were prioritized over facts and reality.

One afternoon, Harold was assigned to a press conference where the famous Hollywood actor, Leon Monroe, was expected to announce his retirement. As the press conference progressed, it became a pool of reporters ruthlessly asking personal questions, rather than focusing on Monroe's career and legacy.

Harold's colleagues gleefully scribbled rumors and speculation. He watched them in disappointment, as they discarded the actor's achievements, focusing instead on his personal life and rumors of a scandalous affair.

He took a moment to ponder the words of his old journalism professor. ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so,"" his professor had once advised him. He remembered the profound impact these words had had on him.

With a strong resolve, Harold decided he would not give in to the frenzy. He jotted down quotes about the actor's achievements, awards, his contribution to the industry. He noted Monroe's own words about wanting to retire in peace, away from the constant public scrutiny.

Harold wrote an article highlighting Leon Monroe's remarkable career. He focused on how the actor had broken barriers in Hollywood and his incredible talent. He completely disregarded the buzz about his alleged scandal, which he believed was merely gossip born out of the actor's decision to retire.

When the article was published, it was met with immense praise. Readers expressed their joy at reading a piece that celebrated Monroe's legacy rather than propagating rumors about his personal life. 

Harold's approach marked a stark contrast to the yellow journalism rampant in media houses, and made him a respected figure. His journalism professor, on reading his article, praised him for adhering to the principles of journalism, proudly stating, ""That's exactly what I was teaching.""

Harold's story is a stark reminder that even in a world filled with sensationalism, the power of authentic journalism still prevails. He showcased how the pen could be used to bring light and truth, rather than feeding on rumors and gossip, proving that the pen, indeed, is mightier than the sword.","329,40,258,157,289,249,202,111,328,98,123,93,173,41,207,0,156,286,142,83,236,187,91,63,144,137,239,131,114,310,30,103,268,201,39,151,90,49,97,250,332,82,8,106,19,336,305,246,280,272,48,284,178,256,260,132,282,330,138,38,52,285,148,153,65,291,324,171,212,134,31,17,117,155,290,7,335,107,81,221,53,265,14,211,307,218,222,251,323,274,96,200,301,26,176,139,161,11,237,88,45,149,270,108,59,226,224,56,273,198,199,311,92,112,238,124,297,327,294,119,87,127,24,299,293,339,69,283,234,16,179,170,315,67,257,248,325,84,312,302,126,333,316,158,227,233,36,135,122,77,240,163,318,113,116,210,204,27,167,192,232,50,60,71,150,129,46,4,80,32,278,263,15,102,154,136,186,29,259,66,326,321,276,182,174,146,228,51,271,2,166,34,58,76,95,319,287,309,306,267","100,37,23,113,12","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
90,Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.,"When I first moved into a college dorm, I was paired with a guy named Jason. Being an only child, Jason was not used to the concept of sharing or participating in communal living. His relaxed attitude toward cleanliness was downright astonishing. It was like living with a tornado of disorganization and mess. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too. But this was the mantra I had to keep reminding myself.

In the beginning, I tried to have a conversation with Jason about his lackadaisical approach to cleanliness. I diplomatically addressed the concern, suggesting that we should both contribute to maintaining a clean and livable space. Jason simply shrugged, and I knew from that moment it was going to be an uphill battle.

Days turned into weeks, and the clutter of Jason's life began to slowly consume the room. Dirty clothes were strewn all over the floor, dishes piled high in the sink, and unemptied trash bins gave the room a permanent odor. Despite this, I stuck to my own principle: cleanliness. 

Everyday, I tidied my side of the room. Sweeping up after myself, doing my laundry, and keeping my desk organized. I kept my side of the room as an oasis in the chaos. It was a clear reflection of my commitment to cleanliness, creating a stark contrast to Jason's side of the room.

Meanwhile, Jason seemed oblivious to the growing mess. He would stumble over his clutter, never bothered enough to clean it up. The disarray didn't deter his focus from his video games or the continuous consumption of junk food. His messy lifestyle was an extension of his laid-back, careless attitude.

The divide in the room was as clear as day. One half was neat, clean, and organized, while the other half was untidy, dirty, and chaotic. Yet, I remained steadfast, refusing to stoop to Jason's level of negligence.

Surprisingly, after several months of this, I began noticing a subtle change in Jason. He started picking up his dirty clothes, tidied his video game corner, and even emptied the trash once. The sight of the semi-clean room was refreshing. I could not help but feel that my persistent adherence to cleanliness had finally rubbed off on Jason. 

In the end, I realized that maintaining my cleanliness had served as a form of silent protest, inspiring change. Just because Jason never cleaned up after himself initially didn't mean I had to follow suit. I had stood my ground and, in the process, taught Jason a valuable lesson about shared living. And for that, I was proud.","115,269,194,129,285,125,112,151,62,124,264,143,181,216,284,328,274,58,204,10,160,314,306,304,326,319,252,109,107,297,30,336,208,28,146,162,97,152,218,288,19,81,78,64,93,34,296,75,321,89,92,153,54,9,239,175,138,66,324,258,23,189,225,195,154,255,222,300,210,250,226,283,229,188,311,127,331,119,277,292,111,20,51,60,303,259,74,193,201,192,100,187,11,262,169,41,301,17,234,133,137,63,8,26,272,114,209,176,179,196,86,87,334,322,231,123,308,232,257,40,270,3,286,113,327,214,155,35,25,2,145,85,44,293,271,281,14,33,120,230,211,166,305,178,135,318,110,159,280,329,184,76,199,99,212,141,246,236,122,254,289,130,302,287,312,183,144,261,186,238,242,323,73,276,267,243,180,161,266,31,168,220,245,163,172,38,52,55,310,46,88,68,164,91,338,279,45,131,59,98","191,50,194,51,45","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
91,Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.,"Jessie was a studious girl, always diligent about her studies. She was currently enrolled in a challenging honors program that demanded a lot of time and dedication. Her best friend, Emily, was not as serious about her academic work, but she was a fun-loving and lively spirit. They were opposite in nature, which made their friendship even more enjoyable and unique.

One Friday, Jessie had planned a productive day to complete her homework for the weekend. She was set on revising the concepts taught during the week and finishing her assignments. Emily, however, had different plans. Instead of spending her day pouring over textbooks, she had decided to take a day off and go to the spa for some relaxation. 

Emily invited Jessie to join her, but Jessie declined. She knew the importance of staying on top of her assignments. Emily didn't mind and left for the spa, leaving Jessie alone with her books. 

As the day wore on, Jessie couldn't help but think about Emily. She was probably lounging in a warm jacuzzi or enjoying a massage. Jessie imagined the scent of essential oils, the serene music, and the tranquility that Emily must be feeling at that moment. It was tempting, to say the least.

Contemplating her friend's decision, Jessie began to wonder if she too should take a break. Emily had no worries about assignments or any sort of schoolwork. She was living her life to the fullest. The idea of following Emily's steps was becoming more and more attractive.

However, Jessie quickly snapped back to reality. She realized that just because her friend had chosen to go to the spa didn't mean that she could or should do the same. She reminded herself about the difference in their circumstances, how each one of them had their way of handling things. Jessie was committed to her studies while Emily had a more laid-back approach.

Jessie shook off her wandering thoughts, realizing that comparing herself to Emily was a futile exercise. Her friend’s lifestyle worked for her but it wasn't necessarily something Jessie should emulate. The most important thing was that Jessie had a responsibility to fulfil and she needed to concentrate on her work.

With a renewed sense of focus, Jessie dove back into her assignments. In the silence of her room, she understood that different people have different paths and responsibilities. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too. The lesson was clear to her: she needed to stick to her path and let Emily enjoy hers. They were different, and that's what made their friendship special.","147,315,318,272,196,149,145,131,190,115,15,103,2,11,162,24,29,268,63,243,37,66,246,206,321,5,320,306,245,305,210,254,77,319,76,20,266,45,282,143,55,74,44,153,256,279,285,119,296,290,156,177,84,215,151,17,313,14,250,316,163,164,27,43,230,269,178,328,191,332,312,90,297,57,56,234,307,169,150,96,325,301,80,322,40,171,46,23,72,186,109,161,130,121,104,298,202,13,244,276,0,108,58,303,141,229,175,170,173,265,192,213,286,258,8,68,95,179,287,89,309,273,180,165,219,278,34,260,242,78,111,160,67,69,54,85,139,214,120,114,209,52,125,38,221,124,329,41,65,148,100,311,42,217,36,232,295,93,239,199,264,126,308,116,238,183,25,152,92,235,182,292,99,168,137,263,94,155,226,205,19,225,249,172,106,267,47,252,310,294,302,262,222,88,275,134,79,259,333,33","194,120,72,169,158","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
92,Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.,"Sally was a workaholic who always had her mind set on business and work. She was not the type to sit idly by. However, for once, she decided to emulate her laid-back sister, Mary.

Mary, her younger sibling, had always been the polar opposite to Sally. Whereas Sally was consistently wound up about deadlines, Mary had a serenity about her. A yoga teacher by profession, Mary believed in a balance between work and relaxation.

Sally, having seen Mary's tranquility, decided to experiment. Wanting to break the monotony of her busy schedule, she took a weekend off following her sister's example. It was indeed a weekend well spent, with plenty of reading, walks in the park, coffee with friends, and even some yoga.

After two days of relaxation, Sally began to feel rejuvenated. She had a newfound appreciation for her surroundings, something she rarely noticed. She learned to appreciate the beauty of a Sunday morning sunrise, the chirping of the birds, the aroma of a freshly brewed cup of coffee. It was such a change from the constant ringing of her office phone and endless paperwork.

However, by the time Monday morning arrived, reality hit Sally hard. There were piled-up emails, missed calls, and frantic messages from her coworkers. Deadlines were fast approaching and Sally was a weekend behind on work. She stared at the avalanche of work and felt her anxiety creeping back in.

She had skipped a crucial meeting on Friday and made errors in her project plans because of her relaxed mindset. Though she had enjoyed the break, it was the wrong choice at the wrong time. She was not Mary, and what worked for her sister did not necessarily work for her.

Her boss was on the phone, upset about the delayed project. She had to apologize and assure him that she would catch up on the work. She worked well into the night, trying to salvage the situation.

By Tuesday morning, she was back on track, but at a cost. The weekend's relaxation seemed like a distant memory. It was overshadowed by the stress and anxiety that she had to face because of her missed work.

That weekend taught Sally a lesson, that balance was key, not extremes. While she appreciated her sister's way of life, she knew she had to find her own middle ground. She promised herself to manage her work better and try to make time for relaxation, but never at the expense of her responsibilities again.","271,208,272,33,147,42,72,204,176,194,209,78,283,39,321,200,205,3,226,62,13,102,253,285,206,232,257,229,198,334,8,53,330,124,128,57,278,303,213,250,301,44,85,180,25,316,67,107,146,336,231,55,103,331,249,111,304,152,34,218,264,256,297,165,76,274,12,59,35,49,16,292,109,126,121,7,173,123,88,277,268,52,131,80,291,22,58,51,237,239,50,150,299,318,112,323,81,40,184,90,259,151,222,133,183,245,84,93,73,143,27,327,279,236,311,322,329,242,189,61,96,139,262,10,178,288,188,127,221,48,28,261,156,307,23,172,215,24,153,134,171,170,98,219,196,148,116,56,308,306,118,168,177,86,108,47,91,295,305,230,324,240,89,26,17,37,142,332,246,70,114,0,87,228,14,64,82,125,68,223,94,241,175,138,312,333,313,38,255,300,254,9,216,159,185,207,233,132,309,19","79,163,100,157,108","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
93,Mary should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer.,"Once upon a time, in a quaint town of Lancashire, lived an aspiring young woman named Mary. Mary was a high-spirited girl, vibrant and full of dreams, the most passionate one being becoming a writer. The love of literature had engulfed her from a young age. She was not only an avid reader but also an admirer of various accomplished authors.

Her favorite among them was a renowned writer, Olivia Belmont, whose work she had cherished since she first started reading. Olivia was not just a writer for Mary, but an inspiration, her idol. She was enamored by Olivia's captivating stories, the depth of her characters, and the unpredictability of her plots. Olivia had not pursued a traditional education, dropping out of school at a young age to focus on writing.

Olivia’s success story, her struggle, and her achievements deeply motivated Mary. She started imagining herself in Olivia's shoes, dreaming about living the life of a successful writer. The desire to replicate Olivia's journey became so intense that she decided to abandon her education midway and follow in her favorite writer's footsteps. Mary was in her final year of high school when she made this decision.

Her parents, hardworking people who believed firmly in education, were taken aback by her decision. They did their best to persuade Mary, expressing their concern about her future if she left school. However, Mary was obstinate; she was ready to take a risk for the dream she was deeply in love with.

Without a second thought, she packed her belongings and decided to move to the city, believing it would offer her more opportunities to establish herself as a writer. Despite her parents' pleas and tears, Mary left her home, stepping into a world unknown.

Mary's journey in the city was far from easy. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months but she couldn’t manage to get a single piece published. She faced countless rejections, one after another. She started to question her capabilities and her decision.

Mary found herself living off scraps, barely able to make ends meet. It was then that she came to realize her naivety. Olivia's journey was an exception, not a rule, a fact she had overlooked. In her haste to follow her dreams, she had neglected the importance of a solid education.

Mary started to miss school, her friends, her teachers, her comfortable and secure life. She wished she had never dropped out, wishing she could turn back time. The emptiness of her present was a stark contrast to the vibrancy of her past.

Mary now understood the gravity of her decision to drop out of school. She understood that while it was important to follow dreams, it was equally vital to equip oneself with knowledge and education. Mary decided to go back to school, to complete her education while nurturing her writing passion.

""Mary should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer,"" she whispered to herself, a lesson learned the hard way. From that day forward, she vowed to chart her own path, to chase her dream, but not at the expense of her education. Mary had finally learned the importance of balance in one's life.","120,273,128,53,88,313,121,56,222,220,285,235,5,50,296,129,330,115,311,251,331,204,199,221,59,187,192,195,138,34,306,188,271,134,12,291,176,160,297,157,228,277,173,163,148,337,90,16,334,57,6,269,92,29,27,63,215,75,52,87,154,35,141,77,95,227,135,272,3,123,111,234,266,174,94,166,262,131,47,20,108,189,126,319,8,125,184,183,43,210,64,65,214,317,144,37,91,168,55,96,314,323,45,303,164,201,278,1,103,158,190,153,15,26,338,177,74,109,255,107,332,225,324,32,110,333,83,100,54,13,132,276,127,212,147,117,202,169,294,25,178,339,67,79,21,18,298,205,39,282,219,42,89,149,66,248,171,62,36,208,279,287,31,182,23,267,290,244,229,223,167,316,264,206,326,270,162,116,33,322,146,200,145,11,71,40,194,181,335,260,325,302,0,7,19,101,305,44,139,41","5,153,47,97,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
94,"It was a fantastic vacation, but all good things come to an end.","A hazy summer afternoon painted the city of Venice in a magical hue as my wife and I arrived for our long-awaited vacation. From the moment we set foot on Italian soil, we knew it was going to be a fantastic vacation. The first evening was surreal; we strolled around Piazza San Marco, feeding the countless pigeons that were as much a part of the city's charm as its historic structures.

Soon, we found ourselves in front of Saint Mark’s Basilica, the beautiful gold mosaics illuminating the facades a sight to behold. Then we took a gondola ride along the Grand Canal, the gondolier’s melodic Italian folk songs filling the evening air. The shimmering lights of the city on the water during sunset, a sight we will cherish forever.

As the days went by, we explored more and more of this delightful city. We visited the Doge's Palace, the city's remarkable artworks fascinating us. We admired the Bridge of Sighs and whispered sweet nothings as we passed underneath it, following the tradition of couples in love.

Indulging in the local cuisine was another highlight of the trip. We had delicious seafood risotto, the flavor a perfect symphony of freshness and authenticity. Sipping on Prosecco as we savored our Tiramisu became our favorite pastime.

But Venice was not the only place we visited. We journeyed further, exploring the rustic charm of Tuscany and its endless vineyards, then the grandeur of Rome with its splendid Colosseum and ancient ruins. Each city, each site, seemed to enfold us in its unique history and cultural richness, our hearts overflowing with enchantment and wonder.

Of course, how could we forget the Leaning Tower of Pisa! We mimicked the classic 'supporting the tower' pose for a photograph, joining millions who had done it before us. Every moment was enriching, every experience adding to our shared memory bank.

Back in Venice, we spent our last night on the private balcony of our rented apartment overlooking the Rialto Bridge, reminiscing about the magical trip we had. We celebrated with a glass of the finest Italian wine, toasting to our love and the beautiful journey we'd shared. 

But, as they say, all good things must come to an end. It felt almost like a dream when we packed our bags. A last lingering look at the iconic Venetian skyline as our taxi ferried us to the airport left us yearning for more.

As the airplane took off, we held hands, silently promising each other to return soon. It was a fantastic vacation, but its conclusion was inevitably poignant, reminding us of the ephemeral nature of such sublime experiences. Yet, we carried home with us an album of unforgettable memories, stowed safely in the heart of our hearts, to be revisited and relished again and again.","322,265,2,28,118,306,3,194,75,84,304,221,41,263,127,47,107,43,251,14,314,294,296,188,316,179,132,93,138,229,334,327,48,112,100,122,76,186,128,68,321,36,61,125,131,303,92,16,140,292,113,244,339,286,283,101,266,192,154,44,98,204,301,287,46,331,290,139,8,282,116,258,312,89,19,96,108,298,260,299,177,7,207,163,49,195,55,226,79,1,119,267,82,238,117,39,338,242,157,72,313,190,323,184,325,276,248,146,211,73,18,99,142,243,249,311,225,308,53,56,156,5,35,23,133,172,209,228,220,232,326,83,237,193,214,25,241,134,182,291,91,269,34,330,97,199,106,13,95,281,272,285,202,302,147,71,148,171,37,261,85,320,143,231,50,262,247,333,54,175,45,167,66,24,206,219,168,273,38,88,80,223,33,103,67,236,234,245,42,280,159,102,137,70,270,170,264,105,152,104","149,76,145,61,112,35,56,192,184,200,198","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
95,"Sachin is said to be the best cricketer in the world, but like every other player, he had to retire.","Sachin Tendulkar, nicknamed the ""Little Master,"" is often mentioned in conversations revolving around the greatest cricketers the world has ever seen. From a very young age, he showcased an innate ability to play cricket that surpassed his peers. His journey from a child prodigy in the bylanes of Mumbai to the zenith of international cricket is an inspiring tale of passion, grit, and god-gifted talent.

In his career, spanning over two decades, Sachin became the embodiment of cricket for millions, not just in his homeland India but across the globe. Every time he walked onto the pitch, a collective gasp could be heard from the crowd anticipating another memorable innings from the maestro. Sachin was more than just a cricketer; he was an emotion that united a diverse nation and kept them glued to their television screens.

His batting style, the perfect blend of aggression and technique, was a visual treat for cricket enthusiasts. His ability to dissect the opposition's bowling attack with surgical precision earned him the title of the world's best cricketer. He scored an astounding 100 international centuries, a feat unrivaled in cricket history.

However, as is the case with every other player, retirement was an inevitable reality even for Sachin. The day that every cricket lover dreaded came on November 16, 2013. An air of melancholy descended over the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai when Sachin stepped onto the field for his last international outing.

The crowd's cheers were tinged with a sadness that reflected their reluctance to bid farewell to their hero. Despite the high pressure and emotions running through him, Sachin showed his prowess one last time. His innings were reminiscent of the glorious days when he used to make the world's best bowlers sweat.

When he eventually got out, a pin-drop silence pervaded the stadium. Everyone present knew that an era had just ended. Sachin, with tears in his eyes, walked back to the pavilion, his shoulders bearing the weight of a glorious career and the affection of millions of fans.

His retirement marked the end of a chapter that will forever be etched in the annals of cricket. Sachin might have hung up his boots, but his legacy continues to inspire generations. To his fans, he will always remain the best cricketer in the world. Indeed, while physical ability fades with time, legends like Sachin Tendulkar remain immortal in the hearts of their admirers. His name continues to echo in every cricketing arena, paying homage to a career that remains unparalleled. 

But, as they say, nothing lasts forever, and so did Sachin’s incredible career. However, he gracefully accepted the inevitable, leaving behind a wealth of memories and a legacy that will serve as an epitome of greatness in the cricket world. Even in retirement, he remains a role model for aspiring cricketers, a testament to the enduring influence of a truly great athlete.","80,51,118,240,216,174,162,183,182,17,264,336,157,265,135,158,272,308,210,138,278,57,305,106,62,263,238,20,266,247,261,126,36,226,301,42,274,296,92,97,290,40,203,179,218,213,317,307,10,53,168,160,255,59,142,3,286,201,111,49,65,325,13,268,211,96,198,209,137,45,207,122,70,77,227,253,172,50,61,298,302,102,284,116,180,212,186,288,11,333,90,167,215,100,339,175,315,164,275,16,235,114,309,206,318,143,338,159,144,195,214,148,234,125,128,204,171,71,46,89,222,293,156,58,270,188,239,285,314,72,313,37,194,130,335,178,273,260,248,155,279,66,327,242,161,140,117,35,26,154,7,208,25,320,105,200,241,129,245,98,252,267,41,254,115,250,63,5,283,219,85,192,99,101,131,127,289,258,163,9,19,237,93,189,28,34,104,103,38,256,300,81,73,112,94,8,269,76,316,24","195,66,40,160,173,94,174,82,188,187,155","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
96,"While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.","President Jack Murray was an exemplary figure who held the highest office of the land. His charisma, dedication to service, and policies aimed at economic growth made him immensely popular among the citizens. Jack had become more than a president; he was a symbol of unity, progress, and hope.

Under his watch, the economy had significantly improved, reducing unemployment rates drastically. Major infrastructure projects aimed at empowering rural communities had been completed, ignifying rural transformation. His commitment to healthcare saw the construction and equipping of numerous health facilities across the nation. His progressive foreign policy had improved the nation's standing on the global stage. People adored him, not just because of his achievements, but also because of his down-to-earth personality. 

Despite his popularity, his term as president was nearing its end. He had served two consecutive terms, the maximum allowed by the constitution of the country. He respected the constitution and viewed it as the inviolable cornerstone of the nation's democracy. And as such, he had no intentions of violating it, no matter how much the citizens clamored for a third term.

Jack announced publicly that he would step down at the end of his term, in compliance with the constitution. This news was met with widespread dismay among his supporters, who had hoped he could somehow continue. Social media was buzzing with hashtags like #ThirdTermForJack and pleas for constitutional amendments. Yet, Jack stood firm.

His final months in office were bittersweet. He continued to work tirelessly, focusing on consolidating his successes and ensuring a smooth transition. Transitioning out of office can be a challenging task, especially when you still have a passion for serving the people. Yet, Jack understood the importance of constitutional law, the same constitution that had given him the opportunity to serve as president.

His farewell speech was emotional, and even his critics had to acknowledge his sincerity. As he concluded, the words echoed through the hall and were etched into the hearts of millions of citizens who watched and listened: “It has been an honor to serve you, my fellow countrymen. Yet, as is the rule, my time to step down has come. This is the heart of our democracy – the peaceful transition of power.”

His exit marked the end of an era. The nation remained immensely grateful for his contributions. Even as he stepped down, his popularity and the love of his people for him remained unmatched. The country was better off because of his efforts, and his legacy promised to linger for years. 

The story of President Jack Murray was thus a testament to his love for the country, commitment to service, and above all, his respect for the constitution. It was a powerful reminder that even the most popular of leaders must step down when their time comes, thus upholding the principles of democracy.","188,39,0,38,284,289,139,91,267,332,71,273,314,164,240,57,294,135,59,283,106,239,140,172,113,312,155,103,97,286,147,210,150,123,211,219,146,204,320,94,109,114,311,77,116,176,49,215,145,230,337,322,166,212,175,160,162,299,249,232,247,250,282,291,209,14,12,265,167,221,92,178,259,100,19,194,42,161,111,143,88,40,216,251,23,256,264,237,270,69,226,60,128,84,258,187,41,104,182,208,108,319,52,28,278,260,298,61,323,326,315,117,67,47,302,274,154,159,30,300,224,54,31,17,190,214,5,48,21,2,201,213,220,280,105,339,136,144,236,268,99,149,281,206,87,102,261,66,29,287,51,44,72,75,58,3,307,6,331,129,184,248,132,327,279,13,304,55,148,191,22,316,309,98,56,101,95,196,223,244,168,202,62,275,93,171,266,233,288,234,27,317,207,81,4,115,263,225,32,119","40,177,29,174,141,74,176,146,28,98,135","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
97,"I have had a great time in college, but tomorrow I will be graduating.","My college years were filled with both academic adventures and personal growth. I first arrived as a wide-eyed freshman, loaded with dreams and aspirations, unsure of what the future would hold. There were days when I felt overwhelmed, days I felt invincible, and days that were an intermingling of both.

My classes, my professors, my classmates, all came together to form an amalgamation of experiences and perspectives that shaped me into who I am today. I remember my first day in Psychology 101, nervous but eager to learn about the complexities of the human mind. Then there was the first time I stepped on stage for the college theatre group. The thrill of performing in front of my fellow students is a sensation I will never forget.

Countless study groups and late-night library sessions were interspersed with pizza parties, road trips, and laughter-filled nights in my dorm room. My major in literature gave me not only an insight into the world of words and phrases but also the profound layers of human emotions and experiences. 

My professors were not just teachers. They were mentors, guiding me through my studies, helping me refine my skills and providing invaluable career advice. They taught me to question, to analyze, and to think critically, shaping my intellectual prowess.

And then, there were my friends. Together, we navigated through this maze of education and life experiences, picking each other up when we fell, and cheering each other on during successes. We formed a bond of friendship and shared experiences that I am sure will stand the test of time. 

The annual college festival was always an eventful period. The campus would be alive with food stalls, music performances, and competitive events. One particular year, we managed to win the inter-college debate, a memory that still brings a glow of pride. 

Participation in sports was another rewarding experience. Playing for the college football team taught me the importance of teamwork and resilience. It also resulted in several remarkable victories, each adding to an overwhelming sense of school spirit and camaraderie.

I have also had my share of hardships and disappointments. Failure in exams, heartbreak, and personal challenges sometimes cast a gloomy shadow over my college years. However, each of these experiences taught me valuable life lessons and made me stronger and more resilient.

College has been an adventurous journey, one marked by growth, learning, friendships, and countless fond memories. As I face tomorrow's graduation, I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and the person I have become. I am thrilled to step into the world as a graduate, carrying these valuable experiences with me. 

There is a sense of sadness in bidding goodbye to this beautiful phase of my life, but there is also excitement for the road ahead. I am looking forward to using my education and experiences to make a difference in the world. While my time at college is coming to an end, it is merely the beginning of a new chapter in my life.

98,I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.,"Ever since I was a kid, TV shows have been a source of solace and escape for me. One such TV show that struck a deep chord with me was ""Stellar Journeys"". It was a perfect blend of adventure, fantasy and humor. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good, so compelling that it felt like a part of my life was attached to it.

The show was about a group of explorers who traversed through different galaxies, uncovering the secrets of the cosmos. It was not just a sci-fi drama, it was an exploration of human emotions, relationships, triumphs, and tragedies in the backdrop of interstellar travel. Each episode left me wanting more, always on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what the next star system had in store for our protagonists.

I fell in love with the characters. There was Captain Leila, bold and relentless, leading her crew through the unknown. Then there was Orion, the ever-curious scientist, always ready to delve into the mysteries of the universe. There were others too, each with their unique qualities, contributing to the richness of the narrative.

Each episode ended on a high note, leaving me both satisfied and hungry for the next installment. The writing was crisp, the storyline engaging and the acting absolutely top-notch. The scenarios that unfolded kept me guessing, and the plot twists were unexpected and thrilling.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and that's what happened with ""Stellar Journeys"". The writers, much to my disappointment, decided to end the show at a high point. It was during the epic cliffhanger of the fifth season, right when Captain Leila and her crew were about to embark on the most dangerous journey yet.

I remember that day clearly. As the screen faded to black and the end credits rolled, my heart sank. I was left with a feeling of loss, almost like saying goodbye to a dear friend. The internet was abuzz with reactions, fans expressing their disbelief and sadness over the sudden ending.

Many hoped for a revival, a spin-off, anything to keep the story going. Sadly, the creators stuck to their decision, saying it was best to end on a high, while the show was still loved and admired. They didn't want to stretch the storyline and lose the charm and quality that made the show unique.

Even now, years later, I often find myself reminiscing about ""Stellar Journeys"". I rewatch my favorite episodes, relive the excitement and wish the TV show never ended. The feeling of longing for the unexplored galaxies, for Captain Leila's bravery, and Orion's wit still lingers on. But I guess, that's what makes a great show unforgettable - leaving its audience wanting more, even years after its end.","223,333,87,231,62,213,189,38,305,259,282,162,287,311,229,180,193,186,196,276,151,135,230,35,239,316,240,80,100,68,312,18,146,123,331,238,24,280,334,228,185,41,43,257,201,270,322,187,61,111,14,104,28,29,78,197,92,127,56,286,199,6,0,184,144,94,206,170,317,51,95,102,83,89,103,149,301,148,212,225,328,314,117,37,22,139,140,64,59,106,248,313,93,337,277,69,121,268,141,279,272,73,154,125,292,1,105,253,118,47,207,191,65,293,250,205,288,84,262,260,190,160,285,63,269,335,90,338,310,7,173,91,166,174,274,101,4,36,332,137,227,20,99,71,109,247,53,267,271,114,145,275,60,218,182,198,284,321,19,221,96,120,244,264,176,153,116,16,290,178,150,8,136,70,23,54,319,75,278,211,224,194,119,299,66,216,97,265,3,155,203,202,126,143,81,254,79,307,113,34","66,71,161,187,143,29,136,72,75,52,107","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
99,"But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.","Fredrick was just your average man who lived a relatively monotonous life. He woke up at 6 AM every day, got ready for work, spent the entire day sitting at his desk, and when he returned home, he would usually prepare himself a simple meal before calling it a night. This routine of his had been the same for the past 10 years, never once deviating. His life was predictable, almost robotic in nature.

However, one day, on his way back from work, something strange happened. He stumbled upon a newly opened restaurant named 'Bella Italia'. The beautiful rustic decor of the restaurant, combined with the tantalizing aroma of freshly cooked pasta, was enough to pique his interest. Though a man of habit, he decided to break his normal routine and try something different for a change.

Once inside, the wonderful smell of garlic, tomatoes, and various spices hit him. The comfortable atmosphere and warm lighting felt welcoming. He scanned the menu, his eyes finally resting on a dish he had never tried before - Spaghetti alla Carbonara. 

The dish was described as a delightful mix of spaghetti, pancetta, eggs, and cheese. Though he wasn't an adventurous eater, the description of the meal somehow captivated him, and he decided to order it.

After a short wait, the meal arrived, beautifully presented on a simple white plate. The perfectly cooked spaghetti was generously coated with the creamy sauce, and the sight of it alone was enough to make his mouth water. 

Fredrick took the first bite, and instantly, his taste buds were hit with an explosion of flavors. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was rich and creamy, and the pancetta added just the right amount of saltiness to the dish. Each bite was a delightful symphony of taste and texture. 

Surprisingly, he found himself thoroughly enjoying the meal. He was so engrossed in the taste and the entire experience that he completely lost track of time. As he scooped the last bite of pasta onto his fork, he realized something. 

But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal. He looked down at the empty plate and couldn't help but smile. This was perhaps the best meal he'd had in a long time, maybe ever.

Later, as he walked home, Fredrick couldn't help but replay the night's events in his head. He realized that sometimes breaking away from routine could lead to wonderful, unexpected experiences. From that day on, Fredrick decided he'd make it a point to try something new more often. After all, life is all about experiencing new and different things. 

And as for Bella Italia, it became his new favorite spot, a place he'd visit every time he wanted a break from his predictable life. And of course, every time he visited, he'd always order the same dish – Spaghetti alla Carbonara.","89,0,122,307,271,123,263,281,229,305,259,297,113,3,147,66,161,35,109,50,96,102,176,250,73,272,303,12,166,199,225,76,28,279,17,171,67,232,164,92,201,278,91,105,236,197,220,7,137,299,292,334,276,210,118,205,16,213,328,249,144,196,323,290,151,293,75,131,56,77,258,331,291,110,177,254,256,104,103,314,42,221,248,134,242,141,335,319,97,298,78,10,111,310,79,300,204,98,268,155,244,85,321,129,1,170,148,333,189,260,107,100,324,46,165,80,283,59,63,190,95,29,255,5,216,280,150,159,54,286,262,195,20,158,48,308,187,126,57,120,226,38,218,206,127,237,167,40,326,41,133,288,246,65,315,327,101,329,223,18,37,162,277,43,265,121,239,14,284,192,285,25,309,168,252,49,149,64,336,114,125,2,44,94,184,117,152,311,215,138,207,296,70,108,169,88,243,172,217,82","184,121,21,89,98,112,157,22,79,78,44","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
100,"Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.","Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a wise old man named Samuel. He had spent his entire life in this city, observing people of all ages and walks of life come and go. One of his favorite activities was sitting on the park bench near his house, watching the world go by.

One sunny afternoon, he saw a young man sitting alone on a nearby bench. The young man, in his early 20s, looked upset, his face clouded with worry and stress. He reminded Samuel of himself during his younger days. Seeing the young man in this state, Samuel decided to share with him the wisdom that he had acquired throughout his life.

He moved closer to the young man, cleared his throat and said, ""Young man, it appears that something is troubling you."" The man looked at Samuel, nodding without uttering a word. This encouraged Samuel to proceed. ""I couldn't help but notice your troubled expressions and I thought of sharing something that could possibly help.""

The man looked at Samuel curiously, urging him to continue. Samuel, with a sigh, uttered the words he hoped would put things in perspective for the young man: ""Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.""

The young man seemed taken aback, perhaps expecting some practical advice for his problems. Samuel, sensing his confusion, went on, ""In your 20s, you're at the prime of your life. This is a time where you have the energy and strength to strive towards your dreams. It is a time when experiences, good or bad, become lessons that guide your future.""

Noticing the young man's attentiveness, Samuel continued, ""It is the time where you make memories that will last a lifetime. Every joy, every pain, every triumph, and every failure of your 20s has the power to shape who you are.""

Samuel paused, giving the young man time to reflect on what he said. After a minute, he continued, ""Your 20s are not just about working hard or achieving success. It's about exploring the world, meeting new people, learning about yourself, and truly enjoying life.""

""I see people chasing success, ignoring the beautiful journey that leads to it,"" Samuel sighed, observing the passersby in the park. ""Don't forget to live while you're young, because these days won't come back.""

In the end, Samuel stood up to leave, patting the young man on his shoulder. ""Remember, enjoy your 20s while it lasts, because these are the days you'll look back on and smile."" Samuel walked away, leaving the young man deep in thought.

And so, through a simple encounter, Samuel passed down wisdom from his lifetime to a new generation. The young man sat, absorbed in his thoughts, his view of his life, and his 20s, forever changed.","107,180,194,64,240,171,314,22,116,67,285,319,256,267,174,266,30,103,68,139,263,188,299,12,112,153,96,286,137,251,47,62,242,104,304,162,257,175,151,84,302,298,95,20,61,71,183,234,74,126,72,199,111,191,195,65,249,69,102,49,97,44,177,114,106,172,261,233,290,163,206,236,133,2,113,278,23,94,168,274,31,270,79,295,230,144,48,173,339,85,333,80,218,211,58,262,337,164,70,246,275,130,303,184,54,329,98,334,28,294,50,154,119,167,222,205,243,26,186,335,279,176,63,121,117,241,51,207,326,150,219,272,202,268,190,170,212,198,89,182,105,189,166,208,255,118,317,244,90,181,35,273,129,253,252,307,193,313,250,99,209,43,226,311,197,169,323,33,124,316,73,83,217,92,306,216,55,101,332,291,11,136,258,143,238,16,29,215,269,320,187,25,338,288,15,325,41,280,86,297","78,43,27,61,107,160,178,59,18,34,141","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11"
101,"You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.","When I was young, my father used to always tell me, ""You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here."" I never understood what he meant by that until I grew older. My father was a farmer, born and raised on the same land he tilled. He had a deep connection to our hometown, and he wanted me to feel that same tie. 

I was just 18 when I packed my bags with ambitions of a better life. The towering skyscrapers and bustling lifestyle of the city were so appealing to me then. I wanted to be in the center of it all, where opportunities were endless, and I was just a stone's throw away from all the action. My dad's warning hung heavily in my mind, but I had to find my own way.

The first few weeks in the city were exhilarating and new. I found a small apartment and a job at a busy café. The fast-paced life was indeed exciting. I was in a world where one could thrive on adrenaline and determination. I was making new friends, learning new things, and it felt like my dreams were unfolding right before my eyes.

But as weeks turned into months, the novelty of the city started to wear off. I was working long hours, and the cost of living was starting to take a toll on me. The days were fast, but the nights were longer, filled with loneliness. The city never slept, but it also rarely spoke. I realized how the comforting familiarity and warm friendliness of my hometown were missing here. I missed the simplicity of life back home.

I remembered my father's words. He was right. The city didn't offer the peace and calm that I took for granted in our small town. Opportunities were abundant here, but the choices I used to have were now missing. Once the veil of the city's glamour dropped, I saw the stark reality. I realized how important it was to work hard and value what I had while still at my hometown.

I found that my father's caution wasn't just about geographical distance. His advice was a metaphor for life. Change, however enticing, is not always easy or better. You cannot reclaim the opportunities lost or squandered in the pursuit of something elusive.

Thinking back, I see my father’s words in a new light. My journey across the country was my coming of age tale. The advice he gave me was not just a reminder of the hard work required to survive but also a call to appreciate where I come from. The city gave me dreams, but my hometown gave me roots. And for that, I would always be grateful.","213,271,307,87,264,10,276,13,323,221,46,247,158,309,122,278,19,175,177,110,96,305,291,131,90,34,178,207,162,270,79,1,260,121,58,66,109,81,57,208,325,45,18,113,313,5,141,40,219,243,169,326,241,104,205,138,29,322,151,202,197,126,102,43,196,105,143,73,292,318,244,258,245,119,54,302,149,336,56,300,224,171,280,70,0,38,312,15,333,152,332,204,230,11,14,116,242,217,16,327,185,125,133,117,132,183,316,265,155,89,127,107,320,308,53,98,130,12,220,235,239,136,59,8,153,94,188,267,93,254,82,85,290,49,42,150,168,163,172,335,7,41,20,268,181,166,120,304,187,160,251,277,261,52,129,281,148,71,286,274,176,95,140,72,173,186,324,156,137,311,215,26,250,99,144,299,63,210,272,218,339,194,68,84,97,21,128,108,294,262,179,200,201,103,266,283,301,100,287,275","126,162,21,185,116,174,198,63,194,54,66","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
102,"When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.","In the quaint town of Guava Grove, where sunlight kissed the morning dew, there was a certain time of the year that everyone looked forward to – the mango season. This season brought with it a splendorous palette of colors that washed over the trees, a testament to the tantalizing fruit it bore. The residents would often say, ""When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.""

As the first blossoms of spring began to appear, the anticipation amongst the townsfolk would begin to build. Children eagerly counted days, while adults readied their baskets and recipes, all waiting for the mangoes to arrive. It wasn't just the flavor of the fruit that made it so appealing, but the sense of community and camaraderie that it built.

The mango trees, with their lush green leaves and ripe, juicy fruit, stood as guardians of the town, infusing the air with a sweet aroma that heralded the beginning of the mango season. The first day of harvest was a festival in its own right. Everyone, from the oldest citizen to the youngest child, would gather in the orchards, their faces lit with joy as they picked the golden fruit.

Plump mangoes were sliced open, revealing their soft, golden interior. The aroma filled the streets, inviting everyone to partake in the feast. Mangoes were devoured in every form imaginable - slices of the fresh fruit, chilled mango juice, sweet mango pies, spicy mango chutneys, and even tangy mango pickles. 

However, as the season progressed, the quantity of mangoes started dwindling, a subtle reminder of the changing times. The townsfolk savored every bit of the fruit, knowing that the season was fleeting, just like the fruit's exquisite taste. This sense of urgency to enjoy the remaining mangoes sparked an annual tradition called 'The Last Mango Feast'.

The feast was a grand occasion, a celebration of the fruit that brought them so much joy. A collective sigh of satisfaction reverberated through the town as the last of the mangoes was consumed. The townsfolk felt a pang of sadness as the season drew to a close, but there was also a sense of contentment.

As the mango trees shed their final fruit, the taste of the sweet mangoes lingered on their tongues. A soothing silence swept across Guava Grove, broken only by the whispers of the wind, promising the return of the delightful mango season next year. 

For now, though, the memory of the delicious mangoes that once thrived in the grove would have to suffice. And so, the townsfolk waited, yearning for the days when the sweet nectar would once again flow. The trees stood tall and bare, acting as a beacon of hope for the approaching season.","150,23,210,5,81,14,315,309,224,185,53,284,231,26,203,2,138,61,241,119,275,186,164,128,269,316,264,265,31,89,295,195,273,48,137,134,12,248,7,59,87,1,200,256,146,98,0,202,263,158,312,220,227,45,107,154,270,197,104,325,95,141,291,139,321,27,148,8,156,103,251,140,65,57,182,177,336,311,301,172,78,112,332,260,280,163,105,13,296,259,9,129,77,84,331,71,228,272,183,43,3,307,179,54,310,230,261,17,68,218,244,278,74,66,142,167,314,149,297,318,240,40,28,257,205,176,267,226,204,60,25,319,237,171,199,337,113,92,160,308,70,239,46,97,281,330,222,94,209,258,254,21,255,131,288,323,245,109,101,147,151,198,268,173,22,64,232,293,334,99,16,234,133,225,100,110,29,166,41,39,328,274,155,86,96,266,4,305,6,201,192,125,303,58,283,20,238,88,106,286","148,61,185,144,46,170,175,159,70,59,87","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Taking this advice to heart, Sarah and Andrew decided to put a unique spin on their honeymoon. Rather than vacationing at a beach resort or a European city, they chose to embark on a six-month journey around the world. They wanted to make the most of their honeymoon period, saturate it with sweet memories, and strengthen their relationship by exploring different cultures together.

Their first stop was the romantic city of Paris. They held hands as they walked along the Seine River, marvelled at the Eiffel Tower, and enjoyed delectable French cuisine. Their love and camaraderie filled every corner of Paris, making their experience all the more magical. 

Next, they travelled to the vibrant and colorful land of India, where they experienced a riot of cultures, traditions, and cuisine. They found themselves mesmerized by the hospitality and diversity of the Indian subcontinent. They celebrated the popular festival of colors, Holi, creating an unforgettable memory.

Their journey continued to Japan, where the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. They walked along the lanes of Tokyo, adorned with Sakura trees. The tranquillity of Kyoto's temples provided them a peaceful retreat, while the cuisine filled their hearts and tummies alike.

The African plains were next on their itinerary. The sight of wild beasts running free in the Savannah of Kenya filled them with a sense of raw, natural beauty. They spent their days exploring the wildlife and their nights under a blanket of stars, bringing them closer to nature and each other.

The cold yet comforting landscape of Alaska was their next stop. They spent their days skiing and their nights cuddled by the fireplace. Sarah and Andrew learnt the importance of leaning on each other through the cold times, further strengthening their bond.

Their journey ended in the heart of Australia, exploring the coral reefs and beautiful beaches. They relished the warmth of the sun and the coolness of the ocean, all while sharing laughter, stories, and experiences. They enjoyed every moment of their honeymoon period, creating a treasure trove of memories.

Once they returned home, they realized that while the honeymoon period might have ended, the adventure they had embarked upon was far from over. Their voyage had given them countless memories, but more importantly, it had prepared them for the journey of life together. After all, their real adventure had only just begun, and they were ready to face it together, hand in hand.","22,292,235,237,141,96,241,83,202,18,154,209,293,149,119,171,132,34,189,302,326,145,72,155,225,273,193,263,69,316,318,66,14,137,187,139,45,325,148,331,75,219,39,101,175,10,46,19,100,323,42,195,239,190,52,49,31,105,162,336,82,261,21,16,118,191,243,321,204,143,27,157,298,256,236,50,97,184,218,99,180,86,125,168,111,70,112,216,223,134,67,238,37,330,63,276,129,164,285,274,242,319,272,152,279,76,23,15,337,304,295,124,7,158,165,104,130,198,317,57,33,170,71,275,163,320,267,142,254,271,265,3,115,339,329,95,102,177,61,140,35,73,338,192,147,222,260,12,181,249,172,160,123,114,79,26,300,205,68,313,41,29,40,146,109,299,94,127,196,47,234,11,290,81,206,252,121,277,281,117,5,244,91,314,188,1,116,287,98,92,311,240,167,166,307,74,62,282,113,174","167,136,6,77,189,80,49,44,137,116,58","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
104,Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.,"John was sitting behind his desk filled with an ocean of paperwork, his eyes heavy and his brain buzzing with stress. His shoulders were tense and aching, evidence of long hours hunched over his computer. His constant companion, a steaming mug of coffee, was empty and unappealing. He glanced at his phone, an unread message was flashing on the screen. 

It was a text from his wife, Emily. It read, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" Her encouraging words planted a smile on his face. He turned off his computer, gathered his belongings and headed for home.

They were set to embark on a vacation to Hawaii the very next day. Emily had planned everything meticulously - the flights, the accommodations, the attractions. All John needed to do was show up and leave his worries behind. 

Their plane took off in the morning, leaving the hustle and bustle of their city life behind. The sound of the plane engine gradually faded into a gentle hum as they ascended higher into the sky. They chatted about their plans, their excitement palpable. 

As they landed, they were greeted by the familiar scent of the ocean and the warm, tropical air. The bright sun was a stark contrast to the gloomy, overcast skies of their city. They checked into a small beachfront resort, the friendly staff making them feel instantly welcome. Their room offered a picturesque view of the turquoise blue ocean.

They spent their days exploring the island, taking long walks along the beach, swimming, snorkeling, and sampling the local cuisine. John was slowly unwinding, the weight of his worries gradually fading away. He had nearly forgotten about the mountain of paperwork waiting for him back home.

In the evening, they would sit on their balcony, sipping on tropical cocktails as they watched the sun dip below the horizon. The air was filled with the sound of waves crashing against the shore and the distant laughter of other holidaymakers. It was a perfect escape from the stresses of their regular lives. 

As the week came to an end, they found themselves feeling more relaxed and rejuvenated than they had in a long time. They promised each other to make such vacations a regular thing, a perfect way to balance out the stress of their work lives. Emily's words echoed in John's mind, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" And for that one week, they had more fun than they could remember. 

Returning to his desk and the paperwork didn't seem so daunting anymore. In fact, he found himself looking forward to the challenges with a renewed spirit. This vacation had not only offered relaxation but also a fresh perspective. It reminded him that it was essential to step away and rejuvenate. After all, he was only gone for a week, but the memories and relaxation he'd experienced made all the difference.","275,253,241,55,142,45,309,135,117,269,323,296,274,266,162,314,66,52,140,89,231,313,265,42,235,130,165,95,168,129,227,281,225,30,25,9,16,2,6,47,183,272,76,108,176,83,103,186,164,271,20,69,150,236,229,166,123,115,98,222,136,75,333,245,100,17,86,50,243,0,322,337,282,326,201,230,153,156,127,305,158,335,259,277,58,179,299,46,334,18,96,148,291,338,53,161,109,27,332,64,144,4,38,24,116,105,268,44,286,93,170,228,32,261,278,11,87,254,327,65,276,189,71,208,283,99,223,239,92,248,114,250,224,111,133,139,233,8,252,292,149,33,175,167,187,101,339,132,143,247,188,147,119,300,48,185,134,198,51,102,40,202,298,173,328,34,152,37,43,308,178,262,203,60,21,206,311,171,312,97,157,70,288,72,113,78,141,320,182,107,329,94,287,49,244,290,280,59,12,110","192,28,91,180,59,126,65,146,160,47,106","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
105,Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, the villagers yearned for the rays of the sun. Their village was unique in its weather conditions; it was bathed in sunshine only during the brief summer months, while the winter brought with it a long and dark cold spell. The sun would disappear as quickly as it had arrived, leaving the villagers to cope with the harsh winter.

""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer,"" an old man would always remind the young villagers, ""because it only appears briefly during the winter."" He was a wise and respected elder, known for his wit and love for the village. He had spent years living through the extremes of both summer and winter.

The youngsters, bustling with energy, loved the summer. They ran around the fields under the warm sun, splashed in the river, and relished the sunlight that filled their day. The women hung their laundry outside, cherishing the fragrance of sun-dried clothes. The men worked tirelessly, stocking up on firewood and food supplies for the impending winter.

The village festivities reached their zenith during the summer months. The villagers sang songs of gratitude for the sun god, danced around bonfires, and feasted on summer harvests. The warmth of the summer and their communal camaraderie filled their hearts with love and joy.

As summer drew to an end, the villagers prepared themselves for the long, harsh winter. The shortening days began to mark the changing seasons. The sun slowly began to retreat, making its appearances shorter with each passing day. The villagers put on their warm winter coats, bidding farewell to their beloved sun.

The winter months were harsh and gloomy. The sunlight barely broke through the thick blanket of snow-laden clouds. The villagers huddled around fireplaces, trying to keep warm. The fun-filled activities of the summer now replaced by tales of the sun and summer memories.

On the few days when the sun managed to peek out during the winter, the villagers took it as a blessing. Children would rush outside to feel the warmth of the sun, creating angel figures in the fresh snow. The adults would pause their work, standing outside for a brief moment to soak up the rare warmth.

And so, year after year, the cycle continued. Each summer was cherished and each brief winter sunshine appreciated. The wise old man's words echoed in every villager's heart, reminding them to be thankful for the summer sunshine, as it's fleeting during the harsh winter. The village's unique weather conditions taught them to value what they had while they had it, forever ingraining gratitude into their hearts.","275,265,178,245,166,64,320,170,109,127,254,191,21,58,313,53,2,268,87,106,243,328,129,8,220,151,44,137,113,97,321,120,232,3,217,134,162,223,132,16,216,169,18,101,142,88,283,124,252,81,24,110,294,70,116,96,72,204,324,239,28,141,128,78,159,258,119,77,219,182,208,69,305,133,5,163,279,152,235,49,41,176,189,278,27,212,322,287,20,50,33,94,229,315,303,102,290,234,312,330,183,36,179,331,154,185,76,338,55,201,63,112,14,237,84,187,45,247,118,1,203,147,200,4,267,248,226,250,215,31,149,236,214,30,150,271,98,104,10,93,256,22,47,225,308,311,302,196,180,172,205,35,161,288,192,99,91,266,259,262,136,100,121,306,71,300,9,213,307,19,42,57,17,251,270,140,309,297,164,281,168,273,314,138,139,95,188,336,284,103,144,292,227,298,15,316,337,253,117,13","92,186,56,30,137,156,162,44,96,190,138","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
106,"My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.","Once upon a time, I had a vivacious, lively eight-year-old daughter named Maria. An only child, she was the apple of everyone's eye. With the lack of siblings, Maria relished the whole-hearted attention she received from me and my husband. But of everyone in the family, Maria was particularly close to my mother, her grandmother.

My mom, whom Maria fondly referred to as Granny, was a gentle soul. She spent her days bustling around the house, tending to chores. Afternoons, however, were her time to unwind and rest. That's when she preferred to curl up in her armchair with her favorite crosswords or a good book.

Maria, on the other hand, had boundless energy that seemed to peak in the afternoons. Unlike her Granny, afternoons were her time to go wild, exploring every corner of the house, making up new games, and seeking new adventures.

However, Maria's high energy afternoons turned out to be a problem. When she had nothing else to do or no one else to play with, she would head straight to Granny for entertainment. This, unfortunately, would always create problems for my mom. After all, a restful afternoon was all she wanted.

Once, Maria barged into the living room, oblivious to the tranquility that enveloped the room. Granny was engrossed in her book, a cup of hot tea by her side. With a loud shout of ""Granny, play with me,"" Maria startled her, causing her to spill tea all over her blouse.

Then there was the time when Maria got hold of Granny's crosswords. She had drawn lines and circles, colors and shapes all over it, rendering it useless for Granny.

But perhaps the most memorable instance was when Maria decided to give Granny a surprise makeover. Armed with lipstick, mascara, and blusher, Maria turned Granny into a clown, much to everyone's amusement, but Granny's chagrin.

Despite these incidents, Granny bore everything with her characteristic patience and kindness. She realized, as did I, that Maria needed something else to engage her hyperactive mind.

I remembered an old proverb, ""An idle brain is the devil's workshop."" It struck me then that this was what was happening with Maria. She was not creating problems intentionally. Her creativity was just misdirected due to the lack of constructive activities to do in the afternoon.

I decided to join a few activity clubs for Maria, hoping this would keep her engaged. Pottery, painting, and dance classes began filling her afternoons, giving her a new outlet for her boundless energy.

Over time, Maria started enjoying her new routine. She started creating art instead of chaos, dancing instead of disturbing, and making pottery instead of problems.

Granny got back her peaceful afternoons, and Maria found a new way to channel her energy. Our house saw less of Maria's antics, but more of her talents. But most importantly, Maria learned a valuable lesson that day. Idle time could either be a devil's workshop or a canvas for creativity. The choice was always hers.","208,337,143,291,156,304,242,187,250,3,300,160,79,107,157,275,57,161,270,211,261,43,139,137,215,296,282,7,180,321,226,223,248,18,260,132,73,290,108,104,158,110,83,229,145,232,159,114,122,284,91,99,338,17,125,285,233,142,326,272,319,203,75,80,189,16,271,240,95,72,283,38,11,169,330,197,199,212,140,37,105,328,86,14,33,193,287,339,269,196,144,167,253,205,181,2,173,241,151,30,40,177,23,217,168,175,117,47,120,194,153,138,312,82,278,323,46,45,10,55,78,322,228,317,88,111,302,123,166,329,115,54,182,63,126,26,315,320,268,243,81,258,309,238,170,133,266,185,251,61,280,121,28,218,334,102,1,39,186,245,225,262,49,13,224,93,70,331,22,141,27,230,129,176,162,246,200,136,257,267,76,234,265,325,305,249,318,31,89,314,236,274,195,188,109,164,4,289,310,62","14,39,195,42,126","1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
107,"With no homework to do, I spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.","It was a rare weekend with no homework and I was exhilaratingly free. I didn't have any complicated math problems to solve, no boring history essays to write, or annoying science experiments to conduct. It was the perfect chance to relax, unwind, and do something fun. But instead of doing any of the things that my friends or other ordinary teenagers would do, I came up with a unique plan. The mission was simple: to utilize the weekend to annoy my older brother, Alex.

This idea isn't as mean-spirited as it sounds, however. Alex and I had always shared a playful rivalry, filled with endless tricks and pranks to see who could outdo the other. This was just another chapter in our lifelong game. I started brainstorming various schemes, the possibilities were endless and my mind was teeming with ideas. 

The first plan of action was to interfere with his precious sleep-in mornings. Every Saturday and Sunday, Alex liked to sleep till noon, while I was an early riser. That day, I set his alarm clock to ring an hour earlier. The loud ringing mixed with his groggy face was a sight to see. 

Next, Alex was a movie buff. I thought of a way to confuse his orderly Blu-ray movie collection. Rearranging them alphabetically was too obvious. So I decided to arrange them according to their release year. The look of bewilderment on his face when he couldn't find his favorite movie ""Inception"" in the 'I' section was priceless.

Another of Alex’s loves was cooking. He enjoyed making his special spaghetti Bolognese for our Sunday lunch. So I stealthily replaced his recipe card with my own concocted version. Adding a ludicrous amount of salt, he was surprised when his tried and tested recipe suddenly tasted so different.

However, the pièce de résistance of my pranks was on Sunday evening. Alex had planned a gaming session with his friends. Carefully, I swapped his PlayStation controller with a broken one we had in our junk drawer. I quietly watched as he grew increasingly frustrated, trying to figure out why his controller wasn’t working.

Every step of the way, I meticulously covered my tracks so that he couldn't pinpoint exactly who was behind all these bizarre happenings. He was visibly confused, flustered, and understandably annoyed.

By the time Sunday night rolled around, the end of my mischief-filled weekend, I felt a strange sense of accomplishment. I had managed to keep myself entertained all weekend, while successfully executing a series of pranks that got under Alex’s skin. As annoying as the pranks were, they kept us laughing, adding to the sibling bond we shared. 

As Monday morning dawned, I revealed my weekend's activities to Alex, who was surprisingly a good sport about it all. His face lit up with realization, then he shook his head and chuckled. ""You're on, little sister,"" he warned, his tone filled with lighthearted retaliation. The next weekend was his turn. I could hardly wait for the hilarious chaos that was sure to follow.","339,237,11,210,137,151,18,9,251,295,220,305,16,133,144,42,289,318,332,168,134,102,275,52,111,278,29,1,221,276,70,41,45,255,208,290,185,254,101,49,25,274,160,172,142,68,119,204,78,321,330,280,84,74,322,245,165,315,79,60,105,299,307,139,117,21,146,98,169,269,200,294,187,99,32,205,178,116,158,23,306,30,209,46,246,195,6,234,207,230,62,323,259,264,240,279,12,28,298,250,26,126,231,222,64,110,2,31,145,214,24,285,61,281,256,328,270,327,212,100,316,253,198,88,317,171,67,164,63,36,213,85,106,190,65,173,71,115,14,301,286,163,91,108,56,337,244,181,73,94,123,39,193,180,263,127,81,109,334,271,153,177,58,260,136,27,17,226,96,95,325,202,196,243,302,203,218,335,309,194,331,34,232,35,247,47,53,13,82,43,184,7,8,192,155,311,152,154,211,157","133,144,158,106,25","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
108,"After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.","At the age of thirty-two, Kate Hudson had finally tasted the bitter drink of joblessness. She had been dismissed from her position at Lane Enterprises, an advertising company she had given her whole adult life to. It all happened after a minor disagreement with her boss, Mr. Drummond, whose authority and ego were too fragile to take any criticism. The slight was nothing worth her dismissal, but Mr. Drummond used his power and dismissed her on grounds of insubordination. Now unemployed, with nothing but free time on her hands, Kate began to dwell on what had happened.

Every morning, instead of dressing up and going to the office, Kate was stuck in her tiny apartment, contemplating what she could have done differently. Her days turned into a monotonous cycle of job hunting and pointless internet surfing. The disheartening silence of her apartment was occasionally broken by the sporadic pings of rejection emails. The deeper she fell into this pit of depression, the more she seethed with revenge against Mr. Drummond.

One day, as she was sipping her third cup of coffee, a wicked idea struck her. With a mischievous smile on her face, Kate started spending her days dreaming up schemes to get Mr. Drummond fired. Every day, she would sit in front of her old laptop, meticulously designing detailed plans. She filled up pages of her notebook with intricate ideas, all focused on exposing Mr. Drummond's cruelty and incompetence to the higher-ups.

One scheme involved setting up a fake email account and sending incriminating messages to the HR department. Another consisted of anonymously leaking company secrets to a rival agency. There was even an elaborate plot involving staged hacking. As her apartment walls turned into a brainstorming canvas, Kate felt more alive than she had in weeks. 

Fuelled by the vision of Mr. Drummond receiving the same humiliating treatment she had endured, Kate dedicated hours and hours to perfecting her plans. Every rejection email she received was just another motivation to work harder on her plots. After all, she had nothing else to do and this vengeful crusade served as a much-needed distraction from the pressing reality of her unemployment.

Even though Kate never actually went forward with her schemes, the process of creating them filled her with a sense of empowerment and satisfaction. Each plan was like a salve to her bruised ego, letting her believe that she was not a victim but a fighter. Day by day, her obsession with firing Mr. Drummond turned into a fun game that filled her dull days with intrigue and anticipation. 

In the end, the promise of revenge never materialized into an act of retaliation, but it provided Kate with the will to move on and start anew. It served as a catharsis that led her from the darkest depths of bitterness to the promise of a brighter future. In her heart, Kate knew she was not defined by Mr. Drummond's harsh words, but by her resilience and spirit. After all, anyone who can dream up such delightfully twisted plots certainly has a creative future ahead.","165,115,286,284,104,154,132,316,199,326,36,229,298,120,314,9,258,110,91,309,207,56,14,152,267,151,319,302,203,245,102,288,10,96,65,157,61,188,215,134,116,129,29,231,22,41,83,187,238,155,141,182,272,150,213,62,138,240,234,136,109,296,48,6,186,219,101,1,177,204,222,112,291,320,77,78,15,304,241,224,52,246,149,87,128,60,330,75,329,262,287,260,300,261,295,223,89,174,99,313,265,307,278,328,7,336,243,317,271,221,327,35,38,268,55,170,111,282,166,68,50,18,193,292,31,70,248,228,254,297,324,206,338,106,202,42,126,98,16,81,277,247,113,191,276,33,43,179,251,54,127,142,190,290,205,196,47,269,21,301,264,71,303,133,156,216,140,103,266,208,131,66,159,322,94,12,0,46,293,256,279,235,211,200,209,146,139,45,270,232,197,158,11,24,175,148,107,49,273,167","134,197,61,18,117","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
109,Ron comes up with detailed and complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.,"Ron was always a mischievous character. From a very young age, he had a knack for mischief. He was always dreaming up ingenious tricks to pull on his friends and family. The lack of any real responsibilities in his life left him ample time to meticulously plan these pranks in great detail.

One of the main reasons for his carefree life was his affluent upbringing. As the only son of rich parents, he was given every luxury in life. From private tutors to high-tech gadgets, he got whatever he wished for. But with all the luxury came a lack of any concrete responsibilities, which left a void in his life.

He filled this void by becoming a prankster. His pranks weren't your typical run-of-the-mill tricks, but complex operations that took weeks, sometimes even months to plan. They had multiple stages, contingencies in case something went wrong, and usually resulted in hilarious, albeit harmless, consequences for the victim.

His favorite prank was one he pulled on his school principal. He had rigged the school bell to play the school anthem at the wrong times. It took the school staff an entire day to figure out what was going wrong, and the students loved it. They laughed at the unintended humor of it all and even started singing along. All the while, Ron enjoyed the chaos he created from a distance, with a satisfied grin.

But, as time went on, his pranks started to grow more elaborate and potentially dangerous. His friends and family warned him, but he didn't listen. He was intoxicated by the adrenaline rush, the thrill of pulling off a successful prank. One day, his prank went too far.

He had planned a prank involving the school’s chemistry lab. The idea was to change the labels on the chemicals so that when the teacher performed an experiment, it would result in a harmless but surprising reaction. However, things didn't go as planned.

Instead of a harmless reaction, the mixed chemicals resulted in a minor explosion that caused significant damage to the lab. Luckily, no one was hurt, but the aftermath was severe.

The school authorities were furious, and when they discovered that Ron was behind the prank, he was suspended indefinitely. His parents were extremely disappointed and finally decided it was time to give Ron some serious responsibilities.

From then on, his life took a drastic turn. He was given responsibilities he had never experienced before, like doing chores around the house and helping in the family business. Initially, he found it hard to adjust, but soon he started to understand the importance of responsibilities.

Ron realized that being irresponsible was not a path he wanted to continue. He decided to apply himself, channeling his cleverness into productive activities. His pranks became a thing of the past. Instead of creating chaos, he started to create things of value, and people started seeing him in a new light.

Despite the difficult transition, Ron eventually found the balance between fun and responsibility. He was no longer just the prankster but a person of substance who had learnt to take life seriously when it mattered. In many ways, his past mischievousness had paved the way for his growth. And while his pranks were now stories of the past, they still brought a smile to his face whenever he thought of them.","4,70,136,266,336,38,243,56,134,32,132,59,27,24,124,173,101,160,146,71,108,157,15,167,212,184,203,200,168,262,43,326,248,224,301,69,18,64,93,113,165,47,281,274,130,58,57,14,50,192,135,259,147,245,300,159,82,221,235,8,273,339,163,35,191,21,338,210,260,155,73,311,258,110,55,204,335,171,256,76,83,23,5,222,175,139,293,289,66,296,201,28,91,42,45,151,63,310,154,145,106,225,36,68,232,143,254,77,111,133,316,272,141,1,34,187,190,331,84,322,181,11,60,98,213,107,120,205,148,249,238,261,199,315,26,223,233,39,304,129,218,119,156,127,188,321,62,302,263,278,253,195,268,112,269,231,208,54,137,308,329,123,10,186,219,3,284,22,125,102,215,252,242,280,153,247,193,226,92,0,131,44,214,198,86,197,303,227,216,6,74,277,78,271,114,67,307,2,164,17","101,126,21,74,109","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
110,"Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.","Mark had always been an industrious person, always occupied with work, hobbies, or social life. However, during the winter break at university, he found himself devoid of any task. Mark had nowhere else to go, so he decided to stay back in his dorm room. The campus was almost deserted, with most students away celebrating the holidays. 

Instead of this time providing Mark with rest and relaxation, his mind started to wander. He found himself ruminating over past events, specifically, his ex-girlfriend, Amelia. They had dated for two years before parting ways. Amelia was a vibrant, beautiful girl with a contagious energy that could light up any room she entered. Her departure had left a significant void in Mark's life. 

Mark began replaying their time together, examining the cherished memories they had created. Each laughter they had shared, every fight they had, their plans for the future, it was all etched deeply in Mark's memory. He remembered the way Amelia's eyes twinkled whenever she spoke passionately about something. He missed her infectious smile, which made everything seem brighter, more hopeful.

Their breakup was not bitter, it was the inevitable result of two people drifting apart due to different career paths. While he knew it was a mutual decision, Mark had regretted letting Amelia go. He found himself stuck in a cycle of ""What ifs?"" What if he had tried harder to keep the relationship alive? What if he had chosen a different path?

Mark thought about trying to reach out to Amelia. He wondered how she was doing. Was she happy? Was she thinking about him, as well? Suddenly, every love song he heard felt like it was about them, and every movie he watched seemed to mirror their relationship.

Mark continued to think about Amelia during the remaining days of the break. His obsession was a loop he could not break, causing both joy and pain. It was hard for him to accept that someone he once shared everything with had become a mere memory.

As the break came to an end, Mark decided to stop obsessing over his past with Amelia. He knew he couldn't change the past, no matter how many times he went over it in his head. Mark decided he would move forward and use his experiences with Amelia as a learning curve, preparing him for future relationships.

And just as the students started returning to campus, Mark managed to stop obsessing over his previous girlfriend. He recognized the importance of living in the present and not letting the past consume him. A new semester was about to begin, and Mark was ready to step into it, armed with wisdom and lessons from his past.","146,222,83,171,97,310,168,319,147,284,218,221,120,138,311,148,72,277,153,250,101,121,265,19,86,300,18,289,44,129,74,199,276,313,178,184,167,246,182,71,274,50,170,209,11,57,190,145,293,331,102,52,219,133,111,15,328,185,91,333,107,176,63,291,227,124,263,202,295,217,205,189,332,324,118,314,212,296,195,28,127,85,114,42,215,56,142,208,253,203,165,54,117,75,228,193,288,282,309,191,224,20,241,244,325,80,21,90,297,214,116,183,187,29,37,339,94,262,137,139,236,230,108,26,7,207,259,216,163,66,123,256,162,104,160,322,17,49,149,175,281,43,260,272,154,312,315,252,320,125,14,268,286,4,103,130,140,279,238,2,321,61,194,305,334,338,151,181,12,155,323,136,81,180,177,304,109,278,173,248,152,232,68,270,159,306,264,31,273,243,336,41,10,226,188,106,73,3,267,1","196,61,123,177,55","1, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, 28, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
111,The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.,"In a middle-sized town, there was a small school called ""Sunny Brook Elementary"". It was widely known for its disciplined students and dedicated teachers. The perfect picture of decorum and education in tandem. However, this image was challenged one peculiar day.

One sunny afternoon, the 5th-grade students sat in their brightly painted classroom, waiting for their science teacher, Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson was usually very punctual but that day she was nowhere to be seen. Little did they know, she was caught up in an emergency staff meeting which was running over time. 

Initially, the students sat quietly, reading books or drawing pictures. But soon the silence began to wear thin and the students began to get restless. The initial quiet whispers turned into chatter and then into full-blown noise. 

A few mischievous students began throwing paper balls across the room. Others joined in and, before long, it was a warzone of paper balls. Every student was either ducking, dodging, or throwing, filling the room with laughter and screams. This turned the normally pristine classroom into a chaotic mess. 

The most studious and organized girl, Emily, horrified, tried to restore order. ""Stop! This isn't right!"" she shouted over the noise. But her plea was lost in the sea of laughter and cacophony. Desperately, she tried to clean up, moving around the room picking up the paper balls, but it seemed to be a futile attempt.

Next, the class clown, Oliver, had the brilliant idea of using the art supplies for further havoc. He opened up the boxes of glitter and shook them like snow globes. The particles filled the air, glimmering as they fell onto the students and their desks. 

When the art cupboard was opened, the students found cans of paint. The classroom soon turned into a canvas of colors, with handprints on the whiteboard, and paint splatters on the desks and floors. The once clean and organized classroom now looked like a scene from a children's movie. 

Finally, after almost an hour of mayhem, Mrs. Robinson returned. She was astonished at the sight of the classroom - the floor covered in paper balls, glitter twinkling everywhere, and paint splatters adding color to the chaos. A gasp escaped her lips as she took in the sight of her previously immaculate classroom.

The students, realizing the potential trouble they were in, quickly returned to their seats. Their faces were masks of faux innocence, and silence fell upon the room. Mrs. Robinson looked around, struggling to comprehend the mess in the classroom. And with that, Sunny Brook Elementary's reputation of strict discipline and decorum was put to the ultimate test.","286,233,332,275,90,315,246,254,304,265,324,190,174,336,17,75,91,285,302,321,301,226,271,192,189,113,333,2,169,103,43,81,65,313,236,4,213,54,272,170,188,52,124,116,152,85,142,198,84,303,25,308,162,82,209,264,131,268,299,138,140,191,98,318,166,97,263,133,232,273,182,79,114,183,314,228,139,122,107,284,126,196,36,305,159,220,42,274,218,283,194,256,24,287,217,327,45,165,199,319,110,227,22,132,108,117,147,74,94,210,231,106,292,290,73,51,125,307,19,185,262,102,167,5,66,225,15,115,130,13,184,197,240,63,64,105,153,259,31,251,35,255,141,222,204,59,135,294,30,20,221,109,172,334,41,277,295,134,176,123,177,93,212,267,329,203,144,320,173,260,95,158,150,253,57,248,96,179,143,155,288,151,178,282,28,211,323,202,261,23,186,237,339,216,56,157,146,229,67,252","112,79,105,152,101","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
112,"Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine.","Barry was always one of those fellows who preferred the hands-off approach when it came to machinery. He trusted his car to get him from point A to B without fail, much like he trusted his toaster to toast his bread each morning or his coffee maker to brew him a perfect cup of joe. His car was a reliable old Sedan that had never failed him in the five years he had owned it. However, there was one afternoon when things began to change.

Coming back from work one day, he felt a slight shudder from the engine of his car. His music, playing through the stereo, overshadowed the noise momentarily. The car stuttered again and this time, Barry's attention was drawn to it. He brushed it off, reassuring himself that it was probably just a hiccup, nothing to be concerned about. He continued on his way home, ignoring the issue.

The following morning, the car seemed to be functioning as usual. Barry proceeded on his daily routine, not giving much thought to yesterday's incident. He was a busy man, and he didn’t have time for minor issues. His car, however, didn't seem to share his perspective. 

During his drive to work, the car jolted forward abruptly, causing Barry to spill his coffee. The check engine light on the dashboard was now flashing insistently. Once again, he reassured himself, dismissing the idea that his car could be falling into disrepair. He simply wiped up the coffee spill and continued on his way.

The next day, the situation grew worse. The car struggled to even start, and when it did, the engine made a low, grinding noise. Barry was distressed, but he was running late for work. He didn’t have the time to address the situation and decided to take public transportation. His car sat alone in the driveway, ignored and malfunctioning.

That evening, he received a call from his neighbor. “Barry,” she said, “your car... it’s leaking oil. You should probably take a look at it.” The neighbor’s voice was filled with concern, but Barry, coming home late from work, just thanked her and hung up the phone.

Now, it was obvious that his car needed attention, but he felt reluctant to visit the garage. He dreaded the idea of a huge repair bill. It was only when a friend reminded him about an old saying: “A stitch in time saves nine” did he reconsider. 

Eventually, Barry relented and took his car to a local mechanic. After a brief inspection, the mechanic pointed out a significant issue with the engine that needed immediate attention. Though the repair was costly, Barry realized it would have been far worse had he continued to ignore it. The relief and peace of mind he felt afterwards reminded him that some things just can't be ignored.","160,87,270,161,48,303,162,324,37,39,115,273,6,282,127,13,10,119,63,185,47,243,207,11,201,322,18,232,78,110,302,62,249,12,75,142,181,241,98,176,113,123,126,159,166,315,323,146,23,122,175,136,214,172,288,184,82,304,319,197,144,216,278,316,325,275,328,72,111,54,292,169,220,209,204,191,29,190,116,314,157,99,259,96,50,194,262,271,199,105,45,335,143,77,120,51,311,230,33,128,264,152,43,30,53,88,296,2,247,211,83,274,84,258,107,95,59,165,183,56,57,149,34,245,187,300,180,64,217,32,248,150,118,336,135,295,228,42,174,225,313,117,331,92,167,283,5,193,68,147,208,58,106,177,196,155,252,49,164,188,44,320,215,267,338,141,205,242,156,260,1,276,290,80,246,173,235,223,277,85,224,121,202,114,20,129,19,299,94,231,280,256,148,179,339,310,103,139,221,125","41,184,11,79,142,133,18,95,182,50,42","1, 11, 18, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
113,I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.,"Once upon a time in a quaint, suburban neighbourhood lived two families: the Johnsons and the Harrisons. They were nice families that lived adjacent to each other and on the surface, everyone seemed to be on amicable terms. That was until one fateful day when a disagreement began to brew between them.

The dispute arose over an old maple tree that was planted right on the dividing line between their two properties. The Johnsons, always appreciating the beauty and shade the tree provided, considered it a symbol of nature's bounty. The Harrisons, on the other hand, had a different perspective; they viewed the tree as a menace, dropping leaves on their freshly manicured lawn and invading their property with its bulky roots.

Initially, the argument was a mere whisper; a handful of passive-aggressive comments shared over the fence. However, it gradually escalated, transmuting into heated debates that could be heard from houses away. I, a bystander and close friend to both families, watched this unfortunate rift develop with a heavy heart.

Feeling a sense of responsibility, I decided to step in. I felt that it was better to compromise now with the neighbour instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. So, one sunny afternoon, I knocked on the Johnsons' door, armed with a freshly baked apple pie and a suggestion.

""Instead of battling it out and ruining your amicable relationship, let's find a solution that is acceptable to both parties,"" I proposed, standing in the Johnsons' living room. They looked unsure, but didn't outright reject my proposition.

With a spark of hope, I then visited the Harrisons. As I explained my thoughts to them, I saw a similar reaction of uncertainty mixed with a desire for resolution.

For weeks, I spent time going back and forth, having long discussions with both families. It was frustrating, yet I was not ready to give up. We explored many options, ranging from trimming the tree to setting new borders. Finally, after countless hours of negotiation, we reached a solution both families were open to.

The solution involved hiring a professional to trim the tree so it no longer encroached on the Harrisons' property. Meanwhile, the Johnsons agreed to take on the responsibility of sweeping up the fallen leaves from the Harrisons' lawn.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The bitter disputes and curt greetings turned into civil conversations and shared gardening tips. The atmosphere in the neighbourhood brightened almost overnight.

The confrontation had the potential to rip apart the harmony of the neighbourhood. However, with a bit of patience, understanding, and a willingness to compromise, the tree ceased to be a problem and became a symbol of peace, reminding the neighbourhood of the importance of unity. Looking back, I truly believe it was worth the effort. The tranquillity restored amongst the Johnsons and Harrisons reinforced my belief that it’s always better to compromise sooner, rather than allowing a problem to snowball.","197,258,263,154,11,117,151,161,116,304,209,288,27,87,111,4,273,185,121,269,10,229,219,319,234,255,287,60,76,40,35,271,24,37,105,63,326,18,284,243,179,127,132,118,108,228,0,141,327,275,324,264,13,44,69,314,136,93,90,294,238,280,267,321,64,317,153,274,272,39,51,253,244,3,170,310,300,169,45,204,88,214,192,186,171,65,94,95,86,160,235,202,146,133,257,42,172,91,226,220,120,55,89,232,236,72,21,147,17,309,158,137,83,282,268,28,23,97,329,81,99,100,188,115,109,231,296,303,318,126,200,68,194,36,206,149,129,47,308,33,79,212,112,7,207,102,316,246,142,332,239,49,222,123,249,122,208,247,38,181,114,1,215,130,337,119,210,103,110,41,182,16,265,173,53,254,31,198,301,277,48,168,59,134,260,92,227,174,307,140,159,305,252,250,336,224,56,167,85,328","143,161,124,9,6,44,166,101,19,156,154","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
114,Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.,"Tom and Lisa were an exemplary couple in their neighborhood. They had been married for fifteen years and appeared to enjoy an enviable bond. However, their relationship was not without minor disagreements and small issues. But there was something that set them apart from others.

Tom and Lisa believed in resolving their issues immediately, no matter how insignificant they were. They understood that small disagreements, if ignored or left to fester, could turn into major issues down the road. It was a principle they'd adopted from their respective parents.

One day, Tom forgot to buy the grocery items Lisa had asked him to, on his way back from work. Lisa was planning a dinner for a few of their close friends and his forgetfulness threatened to put a spanner in the works. However, she did not let frustration take the better of her.

She chose to bring up the issue right then, instead of letting it simmer in her mind. After explaining her concern to Tom, they were able to find a solution promptly. Tom apologized and rushed to the nearby store to get everything needed for the dinner. This immediate resolution not only prevented a possible argument but also helped them understand each other's roles better.

The next day, Lisa forgot to wake up early to prepare Tom's breakfast before his morning workout, due to being exhausted from last night's dinner. Just like Lisa, Tom decided not to bottle up his disappointment. He brought up the issue with Lisa, expressing his concerns about not being able to adhere to his workout regime due to the missed breakfast.

Lisa apologized immediately and promised to set an alarm next time to ensure she woke up on time. They even discussed a backup plan in case such incidents happened in the future. This conversation strengthened their bond even further.

Similar instances occurred in their relationship time and again. But each time, they chose to address the small issues as soon as they cropped up. This approach greatly prevented them from growing into bigger troubles down the road.

The couple had learned that small, unresolved issues tend to build resentment over time, often culminating in intense disagreements. They understood that being open, honest, and prompt in their communication was critical to maintaining the strength and happiness in their relationship.

Their story served as a valuable lesson to their neighbors, who often witnessed their quick resolution to conflicts. Tom and Lisa's harmonious relationship proved that resolving small issues in relationships immediately can indeed prevent bigger troubles down the road. Their successful marriage reflected the power of prompt communication, understanding, and quick resolution of minor conflicts.","122,177,232,331,323,75,258,117,34,305,13,186,112,145,290,296,239,221,140,148,72,1,46,282,228,89,299,208,326,55,198,107,115,163,280,182,257,172,301,86,15,168,303,92,329,71,185,253,276,210,108,268,310,190,5,28,95,213,255,205,10,261,104,17,338,256,32,59,300,161,146,264,283,183,123,302,254,54,27,51,3,6,38,197,147,91,153,93,111,160,251,105,260,209,333,98,43,45,16,36,85,320,113,128,317,275,90,332,245,66,44,106,154,278,173,284,322,96,327,81,321,319,120,141,152,118,52,56,127,263,311,130,179,100,103,250,259,178,49,0,216,313,136,292,295,231,88,14,39,188,129,304,279,201,214,243,137,61,138,287,293,35,116,20,176,37,150,121,158,222,211,277,192,248,94,220,202,219,87,76,336,272,83,212,200,273,69,230,266,181,274,307,40,126,223,240,119,180,73,166","13,103,33,163,8,126,197,123,168,1,75","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
115,"If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.","Edgar was a computer genius, known throughout the entire city for his exceptional skills. People from all over would come to him with their computer issues, confident in his capabilities. One day, a distraught woman named Clara knocked on Edgar's door, holding a damaged computer in her trembling hands.

Clara was a busy writer, and her life revolved around her computer. It was the storehouse of her creative worlds; the device where every word, every sentence, every story of hers took birth. Now, it was malfunctioning - the screen was black, and it refused to turn on. She was devastated, fearing the loss of her precious work.

Her shaking voice whispered the most feared words Edgar often heard, ""My computer, it won't work."" Edgar smiled reassuringly, extended his hand to take the damaged device from her. After a swift inspection, he placed it onto his desk, among a sea of tools and parts, and got to work.

After minutes that seemed like hours to Clara, Edgar turned to face her. His usually bright, reassuring face was filled with regret and sympathy. ""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" he started, in a tone softer than usual, ""It would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" Clara's heart sank. She regretted ignoring the early signs of malfunction her computer had shown, hoping it would resolve by itself.

""But now,"" he continued, his voice filled with sadness, ""you may need to buy a new one."" Her heart pounded as his words reverberated in her mind. Buying a new computer was not just a matter of money but of emotional attachment. Every key of her old computer held a story, a memory, an emotion that a new device couldn't replace.

Edgar looked at Clara, saw the despair in her eyes, and quickly added, ""Don't worry, Clara. I will do my best to retrieve your data, especially your drafts and manuscripts."" At least, that brought a faint smile to her face, knowing her stories may not be lost forever.

Clara left Edgar's workshop that day with a heavy heart. She lamented not bringing the computer to Edgar earlier, ignoring the warnings it gave her. The disappointment was huge, but it served as a stark reminder for her. From then on, she vowed never to ignore the smallest problem with her devices, learning the hard way that timely intervention could save irreplaceable losses.","121,104,2,256,165,117,6,71,69,10,296,1,281,240,182,184,77,68,269,171,26,22,32,275,126,44,252,122,83,152,107,305,112,320,220,195,133,129,173,261,124,187,20,139,18,280,97,302,183,218,190,118,114,317,221,247,248,154,225,170,228,279,5,100,300,157,163,52,306,61,123,82,116,239,108,207,234,8,94,214,160,245,9,282,274,293,178,292,215,155,236,253,238,159,224,277,130,311,28,113,179,89,201,249,137,90,46,41,233,91,323,316,331,58,335,314,299,74,185,95,54,79,145,200,206,16,135,283,21,3,151,196,213,0,47,258,105,260,307,232,144,87,229,287,37,85,193,92,96,202,330,4,222,198,106,295,315,301,57,270,263,40,181,337,325,199,98,48,59,147,210,255,119,231,42,120,75,149,109,43,110,194,55,328,88,278,284,191,318,243,166,175,177,297,25,186,72,11,257,60","33,100,53,73,6,52,173,176,1,28,71","1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
116,You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.,"When Maxine told Frank, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then,"" Frank sighed deeply. For weeks, Maxine had been urging him to get his persistent cough checked out. But Frank, being the stubborn man that he was, kept dismissing it as a mere seasonal allergy.

Weeks turned into months, and Frank’s condition worsened. The stubborn cough that began as a minor inconvenience was now a debilitating ordeal. He was losing weight, had a perpetually low-grade fever, and was constantly fatigued. Yet he refused to see a doctor, convinced it was nothing more than the effects of aging.

Maxine, his partner of 35 years, was frantic with worry. She’d seen too many of her friends lose battles with ailments simply because they’d ignored the early symptoms. However, all her pleading fell on deaf ears.

That was until one day when Frank collapsed in the living room. Rushing him to the emergency room, a flurry of doctors, nurses, and tests ensued. After hours of investigations, a grim-faced doctor delivered the news. 

Frank was diagnosed with a serious condition. The doctor said it was advanced and the prognosis was not encouraging. Maxine, heartbroken yet also angry at Frank's obstinance, confronted him. 

""You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then,"" she said. Her words echoed in the sterile silence of the hospital room. Frank looked at her with regret in his eyes. He had realized his mistake, but it was already too late.

The treatment options now were limited and carried a significant risk. Still, Frank decided to fight, to give himself whatever chance was remaining. As he lay in his hospital bed, Maxine’s words never ceased to haunt him. 

He wished he could turn back time, wished he could undo his stubbornness. A cough that he neglected had indeed turned into a significant life-threatening disease. Frank's regret was immense, but the reality of his situation was undeniable. 

Every sleepless night that followed was filled with self-reproach and regret. His thoughts always circled back to Maxine's words, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then."" He wished that he had listened, but his stubbornness had silenced her pleas.

The guilt and regret amplified the physical pain that Frank was enduring. He realized that his reluctance had not just cost him his health but was also causing immense suffering to Maxine. He was ready to fight, but it was a tough battle, one he wasn't sure he could win. 

In the end, Frank's story served as a stark reminder to those around him. Health is indeed wealth, and one should never take it lightly. Most importantly, it proved the wise old adage true: Prevention is better than cure.","113,7,58,285,296,119,170,250,235,289,42,98,131,319,218,248,16,214,27,145,87,72,132,253,110,275,161,23,200,148,138,268,90,70,212,304,240,108,100,25,128,135,264,232,158,39,236,284,231,47,91,182,60,306,133,258,83,313,36,210,226,9,30,122,151,8,260,312,120,298,3,294,224,155,139,68,56,254,97,121,175,62,86,197,153,6,336,278,227,4,102,103,1,228,24,238,259,45,99,169,149,326,32,323,309,124,171,263,84,307,19,316,262,242,141,115,332,257,117,177,222,44,174,40,93,142,79,61,88,239,303,96,221,206,249,187,282,66,328,337,320,14,104,34,288,22,223,78,339,67,159,297,17,101,292,325,55,123,183,112,194,286,283,180,290,172,59,29,241,277,305,65,50,300,5,255,77,270,213,324,199,322,252,114,2,52,295,10,73,256,81,129,209,118,94,33,11,35,215,92","160,1,184,116,119,194,6,69,80,64,158","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
117,"It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this.","Michael had always been a man who believed in nipping problems in the bud. Throughout his twenty-year career as an architectural supervisor, he had dealt with his fair share of stubborn team members and careless subcontractors. His experience had taught him the importance of clear communication and immediate resolution of issues. Hence, when he noted an error in the blueprints of the Archer's luxury home project, he immediately raised the issue with his assistant, Eric.

""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" Michael said, placing the revised blueprints on Eric's work desk. His voice had a tone of disappointment as he gestured towards the overlooked detail, a minor miscalculation that would have significantly impacted the structural integrity of the property.

""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" he sighed, running a hand through his graying hair. It was a simple mistake, one easily remedied when caught early. But with construction already underway, the error now required major reconstruction of the foundational layout, leading to a considerable loss of time and resources.

Eric lowered his gaze, guilt permeating his features. He had been in charge of the initial blueprint analysis, and this mistake was his responsibility. He should have checked the calculations meticulously, but he had been overconfident about his abilities.

""I'm really sorry, sir,"" Eric muttered. His voice barely rose above a whisper, he felt embarrassed.

Michael sat down opposite him, his stern demeanor softening. ""Eric, this isn't about assigning blame. It's about understanding the importance of raising concerns immediately.""

For the next few weeks, the team worked tirelessly to rectify the mistake. As a result, the project deadline was pushed back, causing an unexpected expenditure that was unfortunately billed to the Archers. Despite this setback, Michael utilized it as a learning experience for his team, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and immediate problem-resolution.

On the day when the Archer's finally moved into their dream home, Eric, standing beside Michael, felt a sense of relief. The rectification had been successful, their relationship with the clients had remained intact, and the finished house was even better than initially planned.

Looking at the satisfied faces of the Archer family, Michael turned to Eric, ""Remember, it's never wrong to discuss a problem, no matter how minor it seems. It saves everyone from a lot of unnecessary work later on.""

Eric nodded, promising himself never to ignore a problem, no matter how insignificant it seemed at the moment.

The early bird catches the worm!.,"Once upon a time, my sister, Amy, and I had been eyeing the grand opening of the upscale boutique in our town for weeks. We always had a knack for fashion and we didn't miss out on any chance to expand our wardrobes with unique pieces. This boutique was no exception. We were especially excited about this boutique because they promised a grand inaugural sale that we were really looking forward to.

One evening, over a steaming cup of coffee, we chalked out our plan of action for the big day. ""We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff,"" I suggested. Amy chuckled and replied, ""Yes, the early bird catches the worm!""

The day of the sale finally arrived. We woke up early, even before the first rays of the sun brightened the horizon. Our anticipation had interrupted our sleep several times during the night, but it didn't matter. We were finally going to the boutique. We dressed in our casual best, grabbed a quick breakfast, and headed out.

Our hearts beat a little faster as the boutique came into sight. We arrived just as the doors opened and to our delight, we were among the first few customers. We felt a rush of adrenaline as we stepped inside. The boutique was beautifully decorated and the racks were filled with an array of gorgeous clothes.

We spent the next few hours blissfully examining each piece of clothing. Amy found a perfect little black dress, something she had been hunting for months. I stumbled upon a stunning pair of high waisted jeans and a matching blouse that fit me like a dream. We tried on accessories and shoes that completed our outfits beautifully. We couldn't believe our luck!

The boutique was gradually filling up with more people and the once abundant racks were beginning to empty. As we stood in line for the cashier, we looked at each other, our faces beaming with joy. We had the best picks from the sale, all because we decided to be the early birds.

We made our way home, our hands full of shopping bags and hearts filled with contentment. Each time we wore the clothes and accessories we purchased that day, we were reminded of our adventure. It had been such a thrilling experience that we decided to make it our little tradition.

Ever since then, we've followed the principle of 'the early bird catches the worm' religiously. Whether it was going to the farmer's market, booking concert tickets, or participating in a yoga class, we always strived to be the early birds. And indeed, we almost always got the best stuff!","313,121,22,234,93,191,2,306,116,281,321,307,178,231,333,7,50,88,21,28,207,17,74,66,335,199,157,69,117,102,73,188,15,163,86,100,104,4,131,91,92,275,29,127,235,264,63,115,9,208,236,27,161,148,319,23,164,25,31,223,183,79,150,291,203,55,243,59,217,195,112,123,190,300,229,16,44,145,245,82,45,213,13,277,84,20,94,285,202,46,159,57,19,81,182,168,298,218,322,120,38,196,261,43,302,68,143,224,129,265,154,119,133,211,318,106,42,175,54,312,87,126,90,5,239,174,331,296,269,292,251,328,173,230,8,162,252,279,56,70,18,338,221,301,105,226,222,225,293,158,260,197,0,177,109,283,216,246,114,128,278,193,192,228,83,241,339,274,215,289,41,227,89,305,290,330,185,39,77,327,294,146,122,30,152,310,35,256,334,72,172,311,26,171,270,176,64,181,113,303","71,199,159,48,9,29,112,100,2,183,72","1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
119,We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.,"Ever since I was a little boy, my parents always impressed on me the importance of punctuality. They firmly believed in the age-old adage, ""the early bird catches the worm."" This principle was drilled into me over the years, and it became especially relevant when I started college.

The registration of courses, an essential part of every semester, seemed like a battlefield of its own. Every student desired to have the best schedule with their favorite professors. Being late in this process could lead to an unfavorable timetable, overbooked classes, or even worst-case scenarios - no seat left in a class that you desperately needed.

My friends, Ryan and Leo, also went through the same struggle. Like a race, every semester brought a new challenge. We learned quickly that to be successful, we needed to submit the courses we wanted to register for as early as possible. This strategy assured us we could get a seat and maintain our desired schedules.

One semester, Ryan didn’t heed this advice. His procrastination landed him in trouble. He submitted his course registration late and was placed on a waitlist for a required course. This put his graduation timeline in jeopardy. The lesson he learned was hard but necessary.

As for Leo, he implemented the principle of early registration flawlessly. Leo's meticulous nature led him to maintain an organized schedule. As soon as the course listings were out, he researched each professor, read reviews, and planned his coursework meticulously. He was always among the first to register, ensuring he got his desired classes.

Their experiences further emphasized the importance of early registration. This motivated me to follow a disciplined approach to course selection. With due diligence and planning, I was able to get most of my preferred classes with my favorite professors.

These experiences shaped my college years. The pressure of getting the right courses with the right professors instilled a sense of responsibility in me. It taught me the importance of being proactive, diligent, and punctual, not just in the college setting but also in life.

For us, course registration was a stepping stone to a bigger lesson. It was more than just a struggle to have an ideal college schedule. It was about understanding the importance of time management, planning, and prompt decision-making skills. Above all, it emphasized that if we want something, we should act on it as soon as possible. The earlier we work towards our goal, the better chances we have at success. This was the true lesson in the scramble for course registration.","127,329,91,204,69,198,67,256,88,7,28,148,36,209,339,278,90,191,267,116,287,229,186,54,178,110,139,187,117,281,10,128,43,5,85,279,215,84,82,16,112,175,202,109,246,89,115,26,17,80,210,9,72,75,328,111,298,255,250,31,258,253,154,182,0,105,181,231,121,324,230,300,288,260,177,270,268,327,238,24,291,222,313,1,63,251,106,135,304,292,38,225,101,264,220,114,242,83,133,335,206,212,153,211,136,23,319,218,263,52,40,173,331,283,58,330,87,325,19,160,193,155,70,164,269,338,39,64,107,303,118,285,123,337,8,226,223,308,207,323,266,20,46,294,150,295,157,237,305,334,138,239,73,290,257,214,172,252,34,49,42,315,296,235,33,243,282,37,273,55,310,98,81,113,166,217,163,301,162,59,77,326,302,241,158,51,293,203,248,122,216,228,318,94,48,30,120,189,213,134","41,174,96,47,20,29,131,197,69,190,133","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
120,"When the site was just discovered and undeveloped, Larry was able to purchase the home for a low price. Now, the price has risen to the point where even Will cannot afford it.","Larry, a shrewd business man, was always known for his keen sense of spotting promising investments. Years ago, when the town of Chesterville was nothing more than a dot on the map, Larry made a decision that would prove to be his golden ticket. He stumbled upon a vacant site in the outskirts of the fledgling town that was just discovered and undeveloped. He immediately saw its potential.

The site had a rustic old home with a charm unlike any other. Its vintage appeal and serenity was overwhelming. Larry, being a visionary that he was, instantly recognized its potential value. Despite many deeming his decision as foolhardy, he decided to invest.

He was able to purchase the home for a low price. It cost him a few thousand dollars, a bargain price for such a piece of property. Larry spent the next couple of years renovating and restoring the home, breathing life back into it.

Years passed and Chesterville started to grow. The town saw a rapid development with corporate offices, upscale restaurants, shopping malls, and luxury apartments popping up. The dot on the map bloomed into a busy bustling town. With this growth, the value of Larry's property exponentially increased.

The home that Larry bought became a landmark in the town due to its unique architecture and history. It stood like a grand old dame amidst the modern structures, its charm ever captivating. It became the talking point of many real estate agents and brokers. Everyone was interested in the house but Larry had no intention of selling it.

Meanwhile, Will, a native of Chesterville, always had a fascination with Larry's home. He dreamed of one day purchasing it as he grew up admiring its beauty. The rustic charm and the enticing allure of the house was something Will was deeply in love with. As he entered into the real estate business, his dream seemed closer to reality. He had always hoped that one day he would be able to call that house his own.

However, as the years rolled on, the price of the house increased considerably. The development of Chesterville had turned Larry's modest investment into a real estate goldmine. It was no longer the quaint, affordable home it once was. The house now boasted a price tag that could make even the wealthiest shudder. 

Now, the price has risen to the point where even Will, despite his flourishing real estate business, cannot afford it. His childhood dream of owning the charming house seemed to be slipping away from him. Larry had indeed made a savvy investment years ago, and now, the skyrocketing worth of the home was beyond anyone's reach. It was a cruel reminder for Will that not all dreams are meant to be achieved.","236,82,67,50,60,330,94,336,124,243,273,318,325,232,126,86,231,128,305,166,292,46,304,88,284,47,19,188,55,286,131,241,274,148,244,121,77,214,242,237,193,138,184,212,218,240,249,33,48,80,43,6,125,112,18,234,335,332,181,337,28,136,119,16,205,107,285,171,164,39,103,152,75,147,303,322,245,338,23,176,159,20,21,106,100,56,317,157,68,175,215,307,8,339,12,156,118,10,116,302,179,190,17,158,129,297,326,275,79,255,281,319,228,293,135,265,22,248,66,177,59,252,72,216,219,264,314,331,26,311,25,73,328,37,109,143,197,76,151,97,7,9,196,127,69,104,250,315,187,113,222,38,202,203,130,91,101,220,321,310,160,49,239,260,327,84,145,117,169,154,122,221,163,139,123,114,98,64,301,70,278,333,115,1,224,229,173,204,235,161,31,223,287,34,27,2,95,300,14,58","54,150,176,183,99,168,97,63,36,171,175","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
121,"To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.","The Sunday morning sun hadn't risen yet, but Thomas and Mary were already awake. Thomas was a renowned chef in town and Mary was his culinary apprentice. Both of them had an important routine to follow, they had to secure the freshest, high-quality ingredients for their restaurant.

""To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early. The remaining options may not be as favorable,"" Thomas advised Mary. Mary nodded, understanding the logic behind his instruction. It was all about the produce's quality that could make a difference in their dishes.

They drove through the quiet, sleepy town, passing by the dimly lit houses and closed storefronts. The sky was still dark and streaks of red were just starting to appear on the horizon. As they neared the market, they could see the first few stalls just starting to set up.

Thomas parked the truck and as they got out, the rich scent of fruits, vegetables, and earthy freshness enveloped them. They walked towards the stalls, both carrying reusable bags. Farmers greeted them warmly, recognising Thomas's familiar face.

The market was slowly coming to life, as farmers showcased their ripe and luscious fruits, vegetables and fresh-cut flowers. Thomas led Mary to an old woman selling organic vegetables. Her stall was small, but her produce were some of the finest in the market.

They selected an array of vegetables like plump tomatoes, vibrant bell peppers, crisp lettuce, and zucchini that looked as fresh as the morning dew. Thomas knew that their early arrival had rewarded them with the best picks.

Next, they visited a local dairy farmer for fresh milk and cheese. Thomas carefully selected the most artisanal cheese, smelling and examining them like a true connoisseur. The farmer appreciated his keen interest and offered them a fresh batch of creamy yogurt as a gift.

They then moved on to the fruit section. Colorful arrays of fresh fruits, from plump strawberries, blueberries, cherries to peaches and apples were on display. Thomas encouraged Mary to select the best batch, reminding her to look for natural color, firmness, and freshness.

As the morning progressed, the market bustled with more people. The produce options started to dwindle, leaving behind just the less desirable items. It was evident that coming early was beneficial. 

By the time they finished their market run, the sun was fully up, bathing the market in warm, golden light. They loaded up their truck with the bounty of fresh produce, ready to turn these ingredients into culinary masterpieces.

Returning to the restaurant, Mary couldn't help but admire the quality of the produce. Thomas turned to her, saying, ""Always remember, great cooking starts with great ingredients. Securing the best batch is the secret behind my recipes.""

Satisfied with their successful trip, they started their day's prep work. As they chopped, sautéed, and simmered, the restaurant slowly transformed into a haven of enticing aromas, all thanks to the fresh ingredients from the early morning trip to the farmer's market.","219,3,130,110,148,274,285,115,302,297,323,270,133,33,243,313,289,266,273,10,332,113,169,129,144,86,157,339,38,300,202,311,299,114,185,134,136,252,104,4,291,73,85,93,101,281,220,97,103,96,198,47,191,223,180,67,256,95,43,182,141,139,128,91,305,330,222,163,175,177,170,259,21,279,164,212,147,282,213,230,36,249,284,301,106,62,156,184,251,35,48,193,320,116,293,215,50,336,138,2,11,125,107,60,82,149,211,286,153,70,227,267,207,179,55,57,64,229,333,167,303,71,257,161,112,126,69,124,159,56,288,307,245,66,241,183,195,269,32,51,45,242,105,176,123,199,46,72,118,52,174,310,58,122,189,225,20,117,306,231,280,261,162,296,262,127,77,287,260,308,275,119,190,41,89,88,272,263,324,246,232,155,92,178,331,87,278,271,335,24,25,152,23,94,120,142,15,276,203,9","125,22,34,8,94,158,149,172,195,154,145","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
122,"You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate. Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic.","John was not a man accustomed to haste. Yet, his secretary, Elizabeth, a highly efficient and assertive young woman, told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate. Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He looked at his watch and realized she was right. It was rush hour, and the roads would soon be choked with cars.

Elizabeth noticed John's hesitation and urged him, ""Seriously, John, you need to leave now. The Senators won't wait forever, and you've been preparing for this meeting for months."" John nodded, knowing she was right. This was a pivotal moment in his career and the opportunity was too big to risk.

Hastily, he gathered his documents, checked them one last time, and adjusted his tie. Elizabeth handed him his coat, and he hastily donned it while rushing towards the elevator. In the lobby, his car was waiting, as Elizabeth had anticipated his need. The driver, understanding the urgency, navigated the city streets with expert precision.

As he sat in the back seat, the minutes ticking by, John felt the weight of the moment. This wasn't just about him; this meeting would affect countless lives. His proposal, if accepted by the Senate, could bring major reforms, benefitting thousands of underprivileged individuals. But he knew well the nature of politics. Time was a cruel player; tardiness could be interpreted as disrespect or lack of seriousness.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth watched the clock anxiously, hoping that John had managed to beat the notorious city traffic. She made a mental note to plan an earlier departure next time, hating to leave anything to chance. After all, she had worked alongside John for years, helping him draft and redraft the proposed reforms, spending long hours in the office.

Back in the car, John could see that his driver was doing his best, weaving in and out of traffic with a dexterity that was almost surgical. But the roads were a mess, and he could feel the minutes slipping away. He clenched his fists, the papers in his hands crumpling slightly. His mind raced, going over his presentation again and again.

He prayed they would make it in time and that his years of tireless work would not be jeopardized by a late arrival. The Senate meeting was a significant hurdle; the difference between his reform proposal becoming reality or being shelved indefinitely. He needed every advantage, including showing respect by being punctual.

Finally, the car pulled up in front of the Senate building. John took a deep breath, straightened his tie one more time, and stepped out of the car, ready to take on the greatest challenge of his life. The traffic had not beaten him today; he was ready to plead his case to the Senate.","85,328,48,93,276,182,120,155,147,12,284,117,150,221,153,149,52,158,112,29,321,67,97,202,114,255,211,281,235,324,41,47,229,135,86,55,45,183,233,246,307,230,87,54,196,171,203,51,184,312,294,71,224,166,95,200,285,191,299,290,123,207,3,118,205,179,244,192,42,225,107,72,293,201,178,119,213,32,320,43,193,109,59,13,157,90,127,329,219,306,310,115,138,28,113,35,337,76,24,11,228,323,132,137,83,238,37,249,311,154,98,9,92,223,260,22,40,38,208,126,188,300,186,330,8,163,152,309,89,227,239,275,283,148,243,298,168,174,165,315,217,101,303,10,124,133,286,270,339,248,231,110,189,58,130,121,21,269,23,69,325,185,70,305,57,62,141,232,266,53,271,16,267,111,164,335,274,116,82,73,258,108,143,131,295,175,291,144,25,106,204,302,279,272,169,216,31,296,79,94","19,95,25,92,178,12,64,76,7,156,61","1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 21, 26, 30, 38, 39, 44, 48, 55, 57, 60, 61, 66, 68, 75, 76, 78, 79, 84, 88, 93, 96, 98, 99, 104, 109, 110, 111, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
123,"Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.","As the new city dawned with its vibrant array of colors, the museum stood proud, representing centuries of human creativity and imagination. The sun would lazily creep up, illuminating the grand building that held countless treasures within its walls. A casual observer could see people gradually accumulating near the entrance. This was an everyday sight as the museum opened its doors to the public.

Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. School trips, tourists, and local enthusiasts, it was their favourite time to visit the museum. The museum buzzed with the chatter of visitors, with flashes of cameras capturing every minute detail of the exhibits.

As a curator, I observed this spectacle daily. One time, I overheard a frustrated tourist complaining about the crowd. As much as I understood the joy of experiencing art amidst fellow art lovers, I also sympathized with those who yearned for a quiet, solitary encounter with the exhibits.

So, I thought about it and decided to share a little secret with the visitor. I leaned over and told him, ""You should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd."" I explained, ""The museum opens its doors early for a quieter experience for anyone who wishes to enjoy the exhibits without the usual hustle.""

His eyes gleamed with enthusiasm as he thanked me for my advice. I could see he was an art lover longing for a tranquil environment where he could relish the creative marvels.

The very next day, he turned up at the museum an hour earlier. It was a completely different picture. The usually busy entrance was calm, the corridors echoed silence, and the exhibits seemed more magnificent in the peaceful ambiance.

He walked through the museum, taking his time to appreciate every exhibit. There were no school children running around, no tourists hurrying to cover all exhibits, no flashlights disturbing the tranquility. The only sounds were the quiet footsteps and occasional awed whispers of the few visitors present.

He thanked me profoundly after his visit. He told me how he managed to lose himself in the world of art without any distractions. He was overwhelmed by the peace that he experienced while appreciating the exhibits.

Since that day, he became a regular visitor during the early hours. And in turn, he started sharing this little secret with others too. It gave me immense satisfaction knowing I could enhance their museum experience. And that's how the early morning hours became a favorite for all those seeking an intimate and serene museum experience.","133,289,198,280,158,332,169,63,295,263,331,33,181,112,231,32,55,335,271,318,1,188,321,116,95,252,107,82,177,200,322,114,226,141,190,12,105,14,19,137,13,8,207,176,94,211,5,113,18,101,31,102,304,197,232,206,310,294,77,149,142,88,220,121,93,239,145,174,279,87,166,64,135,111,44,47,240,118,213,140,258,267,184,96,92,134,0,268,244,230,154,91,221,69,117,251,147,10,146,270,316,219,245,241,138,130,319,115,286,320,179,155,76,120,171,203,269,98,122,173,126,283,29,327,238,292,34,23,334,90,336,234,214,84,195,189,86,212,16,273,150,237,243,58,11,40,43,28,127,25,216,119,170,35,338,78,209,257,229,288,227,51,248,255,128,192,61,246,303,205,152,9,208,139,301,57,20,330,329,157,323,222,217,104,67,7,326,324,264,109,314,305,315,70,291,164,49,247,325,311","14,48,32,108,24,95,78,152,114,64,119","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
124,"I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.","Growing up in a house of all boys, I developed a taste for automobiles. Cars became an object of admiration for me, something akin to art. The roar of engines, sleek exteriors, and the smell of freshly waxed metal became linked with a visceral sense of pleasure. I cherished the weekends when my brothers and I would head to car shows, spending hours ogling over the latest models.

Years later, I met Sarah. Sarah was a feisty, outspoken woman who lived for the thrill of high-speed driving. She wasn't interested in conventional beauty standards, neither for herself nor her possessions. It was on our second date when she revealed her cherished ride - a bright pink Chevy.

At first glance, the colour was a shock to my senses. It was borderline blinding, the shade of pink you'd find on a children's toy, not a car. For a brief moment, I couldn't help but think about how different it was from my sleek, black, unassuming ride parked next to it.

""Wow,"" I uttered, attempting to hide my genuine surprise, ""That's quite the colour."" My voice quivered with an awkward attempt at politeness.

Sarah looked at me, her azure eyes twinkling with amusement. She ran a hand down the bright pink hood of her car, looking at it with absolute love and admiration. I could tell she was proud, not just of her car, but also her audacity to stray from the norm.

""I know,"" she replied, ""Isn't it just lovely?"" I could see her bracing herself for my response, the telltale quirk in her eyebrow giving her away.

I took a moment to consider my response. In my mind, there was no denying it. The colour was ostentatious, obnoxious even. It was the complete antithesis of what I deemed beautiful in a car. But, looking at Sarah, I saw how her eyes lit up when she looked at her prized possession.

I realized then, beauty didn't lie in the object itself, but in the eyes of its beholder. I could only see an obnoxious pink car; Sarah saw a symbol of her individuality, her audacity.

Hiding a smile, I let out a chuckle. ""Yes,"" I answered, ""It is beautiful."" She gifted me a radiant smile, one that, in my eyes, was far more beautiful than any car could be.

""I don't really like the colour of your car,"" I admitted later, wrapped up in each other's arms. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder,"" I added, placing a kiss on her forehead.

Her amused laughter filled the room, ringing in my ears, making me realize that the sight of her car had gained a new, cherished layer of beauty - the kind that can only come with love.","256,56,201,121,313,213,331,10,274,143,245,336,222,181,53,85,212,23,200,93,282,237,203,326,120,155,72,208,117,126,329,31,174,4,136,27,32,160,306,311,164,96,39,46,130,89,288,255,37,40,178,170,171,210,9,57,296,108,149,84,61,207,122,163,128,314,35,238,236,137,339,239,141,335,18,198,268,105,97,235,71,125,38,294,279,74,156,15,234,321,280,102,248,312,219,34,244,258,12,16,297,195,25,290,241,145,328,292,190,168,54,310,146,111,116,308,257,242,303,99,261,214,159,24,182,240,43,318,267,172,166,90,252,173,323,307,82,251,298,211,221,179,44,315,185,150,6,19,139,80,76,193,220,65,270,58,299,73,332,205,278,134,13,330,229,249,20,231,320,95,271,100,191,127,281,289,246,226,64,112,131,103,157,337,180,253,218,263,216,189,78,293,0,302,129,317,338,187,184,140","82,30,174,65,195","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
125,"She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary.","Elizabeth had always been a bit peculiar. As a child, she had unique tastes in music, fashion, and even in the books she read. As she grew up, her preferences continued to diverge from the norm, which is how she found herself completely enamored with a man that her friends and family saw as utterly ordinary. His name was John.

Most people saw John as a plain guy with a regular job at a software company, sporting an unremarkable brown hair and a nondescript frame. He liked to spend his evenings at home, reading or working on his collection of model trains, instead of hitting the town like most bachelors his age. His life was simple, unassuming and he seemed to prefer it that way.

But Elizabeth saw something in him that no one else could. To her, John was the most attractive man in the world. She admired his bright blue eyes that sparkled with intelligence and warmth, and his radiant smile that, in her eyes, was more captivating than any Hollywood superstar's. She was attracted to his humility, his calm demeanor, and his passion for his hobbies.

They met at a local coffee shop, where Elizabeth instantly noticed him immersed in a hardcover book. She approached him, and they started talking about their mutual love for classic literature. As she listened to him, she found his insights fascinating, his intellect attractive.

Over time, as Elizabeth got to know John better, her feelings for him only grew stronger. She loved how attentive he was when she spoke, how he remembered little details about their conversations, and how he could make her laugh with his subtle sense of humor. Despite his seemingly ordinary life, she saw a richness in his personality that she found irresistibly attractive.

Her friends and family struggled to understand her attraction. They would ask, ""Elizabeth, why John? He's just so...ordinary"". And each time, she would smile, shrug, and say, ""That's precisely why I love him"".

She saw in him what others couldn't. She saw a man who was comfortable in his own skin, who was unapologetically authentic, a man who was not afraid to be himself. In a world filled with loud personalities and ostentatious displays, John's quiet simplicity was like a breath of fresh air to her.

And so, despite the puzzled reactions of everyone around her, Elizabeth remained steadfast. She loved him for who he was, ordinary in the eyes of the world but extraordinarily special in hers. For her, he was, and always will be, the most attractive man in the world.","193,27,67,240,181,50,176,228,323,284,301,285,87,306,276,179,309,35,150,135,286,245,185,254,250,334,29,72,196,31,120,127,171,71,37,251,154,116,222,85,84,64,199,237,115,192,117,213,122,274,277,143,15,147,232,223,57,180,294,59,63,291,175,113,252,91,326,33,186,188,90,132,325,212,109,189,283,100,56,21,141,26,129,102,45,333,209,83,7,234,320,97,98,280,229,339,148,5,146,49,200,290,25,86,194,224,126,312,3,173,220,322,226,112,271,20,138,158,328,296,99,111,54,219,144,289,315,47,247,293,292,74,332,255,272,169,329,11,279,41,278,318,307,248,69,210,338,13,261,18,124,101,287,134,0,153,1,162,89,317,273,231,58,42,311,177,106,298,66,128,70,119,244,14,324,12,68,304,190,53,2,6,92,233,51,52,257,149,81,269,230,207,156,187,8,151,246,259,178,10","151,107,32,170,83","1, 4, 10, 12, 21, 26, 38, 62, 78, 102, 103, 126, 153, 155, 179"
126,The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.,"In the buzzing office of Morgan & Associates, nestled in the heart of New York, Lexi is known for her vintage fashion taste, her quick wit, and her ability to close the most complex of deals. However, her popularity among the office employees has one strange angle to it. That oddity lay in her old, seemingly outdated laptop. Amid the sea of shiny, new age tech, Lexi's laptop was like a relic from the past. 

The oldest laptop in the office was Lexi's, and it had seen its fair share of years. Its body, although sturdy, had the natural wear and tear that came from years of use, the faded logo a testament to its age. The screen wasn't as bright as it once was, but it still served its purpose well. The keys on the keyboard were almost smoothed from her constant typing. 

Somehow, Lexi didn't mind this at all. In fact, she relished it. She was often seen delicately handling her laptop with a subtle, yet infectious smile on her face. She preferred to keep her laptop’s ‘vintage charm’ intact, quite unusual in a world where everyone rushed for the latest model. While her colleagues were getting upgrades every few years, she stuck to her trusty companion. 

Her colleagues had raised their eyebrows when they first noticed. “Why would she use that dinosaur?” they’d mutter. Office visitors would glance at her desk and smile politely, but the questioning look in their eyes was hard to ignore. IT department had even offered to replace it for free with a newer model. Lexi just laughed it off, reassuring them with a kind smile, ""It works perfectly fine for me.""

And it wasn't merely about being nostalgic for her. That old laptop was a powerhouse, capable of handling multiple programs at once without a hitch. Despite its age, it had the processing power that could rival many of the newer models. It was a constant reminder that, sometimes, old is gold.

Moreover, she felt a certain sense of comfort and familiarity with it. The old mechanical keyboard had a nice clickety-clack sound, something that newer keyboards lack. Each time she used it, it brought her a sense of joy, making her workload seem a little less daunting. 

This laptop had been her partner through all-nighters, her assistant during the most challenging of projects, her entertainer when she needed a break. It had stood by her, unfazed, through hundreds of software updates and countless virus scans. She had laughed, cried, and achieved milestones with that machine in her lap.

So, while the world hurriedly chased after the latest technology, Lexi was content. A laptop was just a machine for most people. But for Lexi, it was a companion, a token of past triumphs, and an unlikely source of inspiration. After all, if an old laptop could outshine the latest tech, who was to say she couldn't outperform the newest recruits?","276,42,41,329,109,142,103,240,107,311,261,170,11,93,256,112,18,314,12,291,154,186,176,211,296,97,331,39,305,6,35,136,245,302,295,133,263,174,183,318,168,328,216,200,80,266,157,114,337,33,8,84,227,0,67,290,338,87,264,140,82,222,127,27,111,147,203,229,273,106,131,50,192,304,162,249,98,234,13,282,335,129,252,61,32,297,197,72,71,158,40,138,191,184,68,7,188,137,198,278,113,69,161,177,284,94,146,149,56,43,180,181,196,88,221,79,301,49,125,16,268,165,117,333,324,190,251,279,336,74,313,281,130,206,172,193,207,121,173,235,30,164,70,166,308,247,139,116,309,202,307,155,4,110,269,238,78,194,124,201,243,339,17,220,21,316,48,287,59,75,64,45,62,310,280,47,1,320,128,272,108,330,232,210,299,25,257,248,15,274,326,31,83,241,189,119,246,44,323,254","159,119,63,179,82","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
127,"Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.","I have often noticed how many people scrunch their faces when they see the color combination of orange and green. For some, these two colors simply don’t blend well together. They say it reminds them of a garish tropical fruit or the loud uniforms of a certain fast-food chain. But I beg to differ from this widespread aversion. I firmly believe the combination of orange and green to be one of the best.

Growing up, I spent my summers at my grandmother's house, nestled in the heart of the countryside. It was an idyllic setting, with a sprawling green yard that was dotted with orange trees. The stark contrast of the vibrant orange globes against the soft green foliage was a sight to behold. This, I believe, is where my love for the color combination started.

I admired the way these two colors interacted with each other, as though they were dancing a lively tango under the summer sun. The way the setting sun cast an orange hue on the green grass only strengthened my belief. It was a daily spectacle that filled me with joy, a feast for the senses, and it left an indelible impression on my mind.

Years later, as I took up painting as a hobby, I found myself naturally gravitating towards these two hues. My brushes would often dance across the canvas, swirling the bright orange with the cool green, and I could almost feel the warmth of my childhood summers returning. My love for this color combination began to seep into my wardrobe, my interior decor, and even my choice of vehicle.

I understand why some might feel the combination is too bright, too vivid, too in-your-face. It's a bold combination, no doubt about it. But I believe that it’s this boldness that gives it life and makes it stand out amidst a sea of blues, reds, and blacks. It’s a combination that pops, that catches the eye, that refuses to be ignored.

In nature, we see this mix of orange and green in pumpkins, carrot plants, birds of paradise, and countless other beautiful things. For me, it is not just a personal preference, but a testament to nature's wisdom in pairing these colors together.

So, although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I stand by my conviction. Not only does it remind me of cherished childhood memories, but I also find it visually stunning. In a world where many prefer safe color pairings, I choose to celebrate the bold and vibrant duo of orange and green. And I will continue to do so, embracing the beauty in the unusual, the unexpected, and the unconventional.","294,100,224,44,97,279,87,269,73,91,101,128,304,89,78,133,105,129,9,338,125,216,301,123,137,290,143,130,162,283,264,164,28,50,146,278,158,38,32,315,122,153,46,239,321,77,115,48,261,52,300,57,253,332,98,235,270,159,42,314,106,1,13,295,209,149,220,212,219,335,258,124,200,196,76,131,33,5,36,4,61,254,34,213,49,307,186,275,225,151,83,19,296,3,150,259,21,195,25,152,241,174,302,330,43,171,140,176,20,190,223,71,297,222,339,207,324,148,90,26,247,191,96,63,51,320,252,310,271,203,333,284,0,313,281,317,54,67,184,188,211,274,29,134,233,114,166,93,328,232,206,84,198,272,336,183,165,230,210,215,144,113,136,30,41,75,15,94,260,141,173,227,154,228,70,178,318,126,185,85,142,160,40,132,242,243,161,293,231,214,39,59,237,8,306,139,55,262,111,53","72,21,178,12,18","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
128,"Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.","Many people walk through life without ever truly comprehending the beauty of mathematics. They perceive it as mere formulas and numbers, devoid of any allure or grace. However, to me, it is the ultimate subject brimming with intrinsic magnificence and latent significances waiting to be discovered. 

I wasn't always passionate about mathematics. As a young child, I too was among the multitude who failed to fathom its captivating charm. I would look at my math book, filled with mathematical figures and symbols, and it seemed like a foreign language to me. Each problem felt like a huge mountain that was insurmountable.

Then one day, my perspective changed due to my seventh-grade math teacher, Mr. Johansson. He had a unique way of teaching, he talked about mathematics like it was poetry. He shared with us the history of each mathematical theorem, the struggle and dedication it took for great mathematicians to formulate them. He humanized numbers, gave them character, and helped us see their intricate beauty.

Mr. Johansson painted a picture of Pythagoras pondering over right-angled triangles, Archimedes discovering the principles of volume and density while in his bath. And suddenly, mathematics was not just numbers and formulas, it was the reflection of human curiosity and the epitome of intellectual achievement.

He taught us that every equation was a story waiting to be understood, each theorem a mystery to be unraveled. Gradually, I began to see the elegance in the graceful curves of a parabola, the symmetry of an equation, the balance between numbers in an algebraic expression. 

The Fibonacci sequence became a rhythm of nature, not just a series of numbers. Calculus morphed into a tool to understand the universe's speed and acceleration. Statistical theories transformed into crystal balls that gave an insight into trends and patterns. Geometry became an instrument to appreciate the physical world's structure and design.

This journey transformed my relationship with mathematics from a mere academic subject to a beautiful art form. The more I understood, the deeper I fell in love with it. I started seeing its influence everywhere, in the spirals of a seashell, the patterns in a sunflower, the fractal elegance of snowflakes, and the orbits of the planets.

So, yes, many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject. It is a testament to human intellect, a language of the universe, and the key to unlock many of life's mysteries. It is a symphony of logic, a ballet of abstract ideas, and a canvas where numbers paint the most harmonious of pictures. Indeed, mathematics is beautiful, and I am privileged to understand and appreciate this beauty.","63,168,14,160,267,229,292,196,277,237,50,104,140,209,333,308,148,304,77,211,264,17,208,232,331,9,100,3,97,306,305,256,45,247,327,316,65,130,212,90,271,44,154,101,315,321,294,127,317,116,58,268,246,324,11,132,284,240,95,71,54,138,236,181,7,339,278,114,129,245,166,6,296,13,216,75,328,15,186,146,310,163,142,81,137,124,282,34,94,295,189,109,285,165,291,302,72,215,297,289,106,41,252,177,135,31,307,89,220,42,279,156,171,22,254,329,290,62,24,288,66,125,123,70,53,78,243,274,99,250,10,141,29,318,110,218,145,38,194,74,25,73,169,275,49,83,84,164,157,107,260,36,32,200,98,319,103,0,184,222,139,205,19,119,33,258,185,193,112,197,61,204,322,115,199,8,206,231,198,234,188,210,337,159,309,126,1,20,242,235,39,300,195,172,249,60,255,202,120,51","86,122,186,48,69","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
129,"Although he isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.","My brother and I are different in many ways, including our taste in music. While I lean more towards rock and roll, he has always been a fan of alternative pop. There is this singer, in particular, he absolutely adores. This singer is praised by critics worldwide, yet he isn't my favorite.

My brother first came across this singer's work a couple of years ago. He had been browsing for new music when he stumbled upon one of the singer's tracks on a recommended playlist. Since then, my brother has been his biggest fan. 

His room is plastered with the singer's posters and signed CDs, and he can always be caught humming one of his tunes. He loves to discuss the singer's vocals and techniques with anyone who would listen. The singer's unique style had struck a chord with my brother and he found his songs fascinating and new.

Every car trip would feature the singer's latest album on repeat. Each family gathering would have my brother's persuasive argument about how this singer's songs outshine all others. And every conversation about music would, inevitably, lead back to this singer. My brother’s adoration wasn't just about the music; it extended into deep respect for the singer’s craftsmanship. 

He has gone so far as to research the singer's influences, inspirations, and musical journey. He saved up for months to afford a ticket to one of his concerts. I remember how his face lit up as he watched his favorite singer performing live on stage, looking completely in awe. 

One night, I heard him practicing guitar chords. He was trying to replicate the singer’s techniques, his fingers clumsily working their way around the strings. I watched as he worked late into the night, fuelled by determination and his admiration for the singer. His persistence was admirable, if not slightly obsessive.

I have tried to see what my brother finds so exceptional about this singer. I've listened to the albums, watched interviews, even accompanied him to a concert. And while I can appreciate his talent and artistry, he isn't my favorite singer. He doesn't stir in me the same feelings he does in my brother. 

Yet, I can't help but be drawn into the world my brother adores. The singer’s impact on my brother has been profound and it's impossible not to respect that. Although he isn't my favorite singer, I have learned to understand and appreciate his artistry through my brother's eyes.","68,3,37,28,224,89,286,152,109,135,207,60,126,320,278,226,225,307,131,33,227,284,160,155,233,7,67,144,334,21,69,84,117,276,99,167,261,312,165,154,288,134,148,30,64,239,244,50,188,114,46,260,6,61,98,330,125,210,53,318,299,128,26,172,322,169,65,337,85,339,9,209,285,74,15,182,101,104,55,161,300,185,240,238,235,295,272,76,215,123,213,56,54,304,262,177,136,248,14,159,314,282,40,96,140,280,200,271,91,36,316,287,141,176,256,22,119,222,311,298,52,107,29,127,190,189,332,257,319,32,234,0,20,166,86,191,273,164,310,252,66,212,63,132,168,18,231,321,153,208,1,70,111,313,193,204,325,323,275,150,187,230,241,289,162,217,173,11,2,170,149,251,291,329,214,137,335,232,110,264,179,145,203,41,31,146,265,106,283,124,194,186,79,220,102,118,10,246,157,266","190,57,13,124,62","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
130,"We have been waiting for you for 3 hours, but that's okay. It’s better late than never.","In the heart of the bustling city, in a little coffee shop tucked away on a side street, we sat waiting. The three of us, Richard, Rachel, and I, had been waiting for him for over three hours. But we agreed, it was okay.

Richard fiddled with the sugar packets and Rachel refilled her coffee for the third time, the tension palpable. The clock above the barista station continued to tick away the minutes. We exchanged nervous glances, wondering when he would finally arrive.

The coffee shop buzzed with chatter from the other customers, but for us, time felt suspended. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, normally comforting, but that day it only heightened our anxiety. Richard had stopped fiddling with the sugar packets and was now staring into his untouched latte, deep in thought.

Rachel, ever the optimist, tried to keep our spirits up. She pointed out the weather outside, warm and sunny, a stark contrast to the anxiety brewing inside the small coffee shop. She reminded us of the saying, ""Better late than never,"" and urged us to hold on to that hope. We smiled weakly, appreciating her attempt to lighten the mood.

In the third hour of our wait, the door to the coffee shop swung open. For a moment, our hearts jumped, but it was just another customer. Rachel reached out and squeezed both our hands, reminding us to be patient. Richard sighed heavily, his impatience seeping through.

Just as the clock was about to mark the end of the third hour, he walked in. The door of the coffee shop opened and in came Matthew, our long-awaited friend. He was panting heavily, presumably from rushing, and his face held an apologetic smile. 

As he approached us, we stood up, relief washing over us. He immediately apologized for his tardiness, but we brushed it off, simply grateful for his presence. Rachel repeated her mantra, ""Better late than never,"" and we all shared a relieved chuckle.

Finally together again after all these years, the atmosphere suddenly lightened. The tension dissolved, and the coffee shop returned to being a haven of warmth and comfort. In that moment, we knew that, despite the long wait, it was indeed better late than never.","168,15,256,227,74,58,71,9,84,113,217,45,146,164,198,212,103,219,105,44,318,247,72,109,5,29,46,234,320,224,304,3,324,136,273,151,27,300,196,102,107,166,200,83,52,241,92,142,306,335,261,62,305,135,329,244,209,63,13,129,172,132,6,338,327,328,208,11,26,158,82,266,205,60,211,259,202,75,47,154,331,254,322,69,131,336,112,267,296,310,285,78,160,140,240,265,43,242,59,189,40,51,281,290,190,223,138,14,253,325,91,188,276,238,133,115,252,127,8,263,194,111,272,309,333,246,155,124,245,12,149,53,301,152,319,239,260,70,163,141,156,288,292,33,175,16,293,182,280,258,147,116,339,87,108,180,284,61,307,264,117,312,218,191,41,17,237,19,161,255,32,321,278,73,106,148,65,279,99,323,126,55,206,144,229,42,294,30,181,233,122,165,4,134,125,197,35,97,268,7","85,62,115,194,54","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
131,"Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.","It was two weeks ago that I bought the envelope, the stamps, and the stationery with the intention of writing the letter. The letter that I had been putting off for far too long. Everyday, I sat at my desk, pen in hand, staring blankly at the pristine white paper. I could not bring myself to begin. The words did not come, the thoughts were muddled, and my emotions were in turmoil.

I knew the letter was important, not just for me, but also for the person it was meant for. I needed to reach out, to let them know that I cared, and to share my thoughts and feelings. But, the fears held me back. The fear of rejection, the fear of misunderstanding, and the fear of stirring up old memories that we both had tried so hard to forget.

Days went by, and I still couldn't put pen to paper. The stationery sat on my desk, untouched. At night, I would lay awake, mulling over what to write. Sentences formed and dissolved in my mind like wisps of smoke.

The deadline drew closer. The letter had to be sent. It was my last chance at reconciliation, my last chance to make things right.

Eventually, frustration got the better of me. I threw caution to the wind and let my hand glide across the paper. Words started to form, sentences connected, and paragraphs began to take shape. It was raw, it was unfiltered, and it was straight from my heart.

The initial hesitance gradually morphed into a ceaseless flow. An hour turned into two, then into three, and before I knew it, the night had turned into day. The sun's first rays touched upon the completed letter that lay on my desk.

There was a sense of relief in seeing it finished. All that was left was to seal the envelope and send it on its way.

Although it took me two weeks, I finally did it. I sent the letter. All my emotions, my thoughts, my feelings, my fears, and my hopes were contained within that single piece of paper. 

As I watched the mailman take the envelope, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I had overcome my fears, I had poured my heart out onto a piece of paper, and now it was out there, travelling to the person who needed to read it.

The waiting period was agonizing. Days turned into nights and nights into days, my heart thrumming with anticipation every time the phone rang. The uncertainty was overwhelming, but there was also hope. Hope that the letter would reach the right person at the right time.

Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.

132,"A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.","Once upon a time, there was a friend of mine named Peter. In spite of his charismatic personality and endless potential, his academic performance had been consistently low. One particular hurdle which seemed insurmountable for him was the 12th grade. Astonishingly, he had failed this grade, not once or twice, but an incredible five times consecutively. 

Having been born into a family where education was highly revered, this posed a great source of disappointment for him. His parents, though supportive, were deeply disheartened by his repeated failures. They tried to encourage him, hired tutors for him and even sent him to counseling, but nothing seemed to work. Peter, himself, was a beacon of resilience, but each failure dented his spirit and filled him with despair. 

However, this story is not a tale of perpetual failure. Instead, it is a testament to the profound strength of the human spirit. After all his previous unsuccessful attempts, Peter didn't lose hope. He resolved to give the 12th grade yet another shot, this time armed with an unwavering determination and an undying resolve. 

During this sixth attempt, he devoted himself to his studies with unprecedented focus. Each day, he would bury himself in his books, absorbing every morsel of knowledge he could. He spent hours practicing, revising, and solving problems. It wasn't easy, but he continued to push himself, refusing to succumb to the allure of defeat.

His friends and family noticed the change in him. His parents saw the late-night lights in his room, and his friends heard less from him as he spent less time socializing and more time studying. He resisted every temptation, every diversion, dedicated to rewriting his fate. 

His teachers also began to see this change. Their initial skepticism slowly turned to surprise as they saw the commitment and progress he was making. They applauded his efforts and provided additional support, impressed by his determination. 

Finally, the dreaded examination day arrived. Unlike the previous times, Peter walked into the examination hall with a renewed confidence. He believed in his preparation and trusted the effort he had put in. 

Days turned into weeks, and finally, the results were announced. This time, my friend Peter did not fail. He had not only passed the 12th grade but had done so with flying colors. His victory was not just over his academic failure but over his self-doubt and despair. The young man who had failed 12th grade for five straight years finally triumphed, proving to everyone and himself that persistence and determination always bear fruit. 

Everyone around him celebrated his success, but the joy in Peter's eyes was unmatched. After all, he had overcome not just an academic hurdle, but also a mental barrier. His story serves as an inspiration to all those who have ever faced failure, a reminder that it is never the end, but rather, a stepping stone towards success.","244,74,299,89,258,66,13,120,184,100,82,46,84,86,331,35,81,286,266,94,123,56,230,185,153,12,161,101,140,158,242,332,173,205,75,240,58,18,128,51,295,88,168,181,188,30,38,118,247,29,78,5,329,227,113,36,174,238,114,220,124,85,71,193,79,136,229,152,276,17,148,179,283,215,164,172,187,145,178,255,139,144,311,289,83,48,271,57,296,290,98,133,197,300,169,213,304,69,306,335,309,19,177,234,211,121,219,165,53,68,96,171,176,62,1,287,41,43,298,277,4,274,23,119,256,126,313,25,195,200,157,125,50,307,321,107,105,110,109,117,190,262,231,26,80,252,131,15,91,32,209,194,27,167,135,183,224,130,39,201,40,137,317,236,210,67,303,248,191,61,143,233,52,291,243,175,44,239,129,55,198,134,337,146,223,280,265,319,270,269,301,217,322,108,104,8,150,159,279,334","158,147,92,182,155","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
133,"I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.","Three years ago, I embarked on a new journey in the form of a training program. I was enrolled in an esteemed certification program that was expected to be completed within a year. However, life had different plans for me and it took me three years instead of one to finish the training program. It began with excitement and enthusiasm.

The first month was a breeze as I grappled with the introductory phase. It was intriguing, a mix of theory and practicals, which were easy to tackle. However, as the course progressed, I found myself struggling to keep up with the pace. The advanced levels were complex and required time and dedication which I was struggling to give.

Weeks turned into months and I was behind my peers. I saw them pass out, stepping into successful professional lives while I was still caught up in the course. It was disheartening and many times I thought about quitting. I felt like a failure, watching everyone move forward while I was stuck.

But, in those moments of despair, something within me refused to give up. I began devoting more hours, staying up late into the nights, grasping those complex concepts. I focused not on the lost time, but the future I could secure with this credential.

The second year of the program was about persistence. The lessons were becoming increasingly intricate. I was slowly but surely gaining a better understanding of the course content. I felt my knowledge base expanding, my skills improving. The once intimidating lectures were beginning to make sense.

In the third year, I hit my stride. I had learned to manage my time effectively. I was actively participating in the online sessions, problem-solving discussions, and practical tasks. I was no longer that struggling candidate. Instead, I was a confident participant who wasn't afraid to face the challenges that came my way.

After three years of hard work, determination, and a tenacious refusal to give up, I finally completed the training program. The feeling was exhilarating. It was a moment of pride and joy, the day when I received my credential. I had achieved what I had set out to do, albeit at a slower pace.

At the end of it all, I knew that the three-year journey had been worth it. Not only did I have the credential now, but I also had the experience and knowledge that came along with it. I emerged from the program not as the fastest but as someone who persisted, who grew, and who achieved. It was a testament to my patience, my resilience, and my ability to withstand the pressures. It may have taken longer, but the triumph was all the more sweet for it.","235,149,283,119,281,224,265,216,30,51,273,89,95,310,189,110,12,233,160,290,59,325,62,253,303,202,259,154,64,230,293,88,270,181,215,73,83,185,56,57,234,322,146,312,250,299,13,237,18,309,295,20,330,256,292,54,25,103,79,239,199,289,43,245,276,241,193,267,205,72,60,152,318,188,58,92,244,314,298,321,44,206,101,142,132,247,71,96,204,4,315,296,50,302,120,213,123,236,138,195,214,33,49,176,223,111,271,305,179,61,66,87,169,46,277,37,207,135,63,19,131,117,102,200,328,220,109,334,182,170,226,323,97,335,163,114,82,48,0,337,248,211,308,167,232,35,121,197,153,300,100,2,3,313,10,262,143,5,186,238,279,332,297,209,269,246,23,339,91,130,112,52,124,282,53,47,264,201,219,243,171,14,40,275,8,67,27,118,190,145,122,231,42,266,31,85,172,134,68,137","170,121,85,198,118","1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
134,Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through.,"Clark was known among us as an exceptionally cautious man; the sort who pondered for an hour before picking up a shirt. His indecisiveness was even more pronounced when it came to life-altering decisions. So it came as no surprise when he took a decade to propose to Cece, the woman of his dreams.

Clark and Cece had first crossed paths at a charity event, instantly hitting it off. Their connection was palpable, it sparkled in their shared glances and in the way their laughter echoed in harmony. Despite their undeniable bond, Clark held back from taking their relationship to the next level. His fear of commitment was a hurdle that we all patiently waited for him to jump over.

Cece, on the other hand, was as patient as a saint. Unlike Clark, she had her heart and mind in sync from the beginning. She was sure about Clark, about them. But she also respected his need for time and space. Not once did she pressure him into making a decision he wasn't ready to make.

The years slipped by. Friends began to find soulmates and start families. Each wedding they attended led to further speculation about their relationship among our group. Some were optimistic, believing in Clark's love for Cece. Others were more cynical, chalking their story up as a lost cause.

We often found Clark lost in thought, gazing at Cece with a mix of longing and indecision. It was agonizing to watch him struggle between his fear and his love. Many a time, we nudged Clark, gave him pep talks, shared our own experiences, anything to help him take that leap of faith. 

By the tenth year, our hopes had dwindled. Some friends had even given up and stopped asking Clark about when he'd pop the question. It seemed like Clark and Cece's story would remain as a simple tale of dating. Then, in a turn of events that came as a shock to us all, Clark finally stepped up.

It was at our annual summer barbecue. Clark cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention, and we watched as he sank to one knee in front of Cece. She stared at him, her eyes wide with surprise, as he fumbled his way through a heartfelt proposal. 

Seeing Clark, ever so hesitant, lay his heart out in front of Cece and ask her to marry him was a moment of pure bliss. We all held our breath as we waited for Cece's answer. When she shouted a tearful 'Yes', we erupted into cheers. We had all lost hope, but finally, after a decade of waiting, Clark had come through.","52,87,232,246,233,178,269,292,268,100,194,267,257,44,26,213,332,20,310,185,55,330,92,253,161,93,154,184,175,291,90,110,115,116,112,35,122,201,61,133,228,152,51,99,0,273,262,250,8,240,18,139,338,324,85,2,200,214,312,128,283,153,106,305,57,17,314,118,209,279,326,149,261,317,40,288,265,281,177,163,294,206,289,186,223,239,297,320,148,202,95,270,10,67,39,275,313,27,286,159,302,318,113,238,9,19,325,62,15,131,120,299,280,13,22,56,50,331,278,45,132,276,339,36,307,166,123,41,141,176,199,181,244,151,86,108,196,237,7,335,231,193,68,334,130,191,119,241,296,215,82,222,189,309,105,230,158,327,3,48,160,322,59,58,135,169,101,221,234,83,172,303,260,157,60,315,64,76,121,79,226,219,117,47,77,24,328,138,227,124,287,205,54,88,211,243,300,293,248,146","145,110,121,40,165","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
135,"Although she realized the mistake a week after the incident, she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.","Charlotte Simmons was the kind of woman who prided herself on her meticulous attention to detail. She had a quick wit, sharp memory, and a keen eye for perfection. Often, this peculiar nature of hers made her a target for criticism and ridicule. She was known as the 'flawless one' among her friends and colleagues. But her impeccable persona took a severe blow during one chilly winter night two years ago.

It was during an annual gala at her office, where she worked as a marketing head. Due to her diligent nature, Charlotte was entrusted with the responsibility of handling the entire event. The event was about to take a disastrous turn due to a single error that was going to dent Charlotte's reputation and her impeccable image forever.

A week after the gala, she realized the mistake she had made. She had misjudged a promotional deal, causing a significant financial loss for her company. Her meticulous nature and pride over her attention to detail had been her downfall. She was shocked at her oversight and couldn't believe the blunder she had committed.

Charlotte was devastated; she had not only failed herself but had failed the trust that her boss had put in her. However, her ego was wounded too much to admit her mistake. She decided to hide it and covered it with some paperwork maneuvering, thinking that no one would ever notice it.

Two years passed. Charlotte, however, couldn't forget the mistake. It haunted her every day. The guilt started to eat at her. Her work performance started to wane, and the joy she once took in her perfection slowly began to fade. She was living in constant fear that her lie would be discovered.

One day, she woke up and felt like she couldn't keep up the facade anymore. She had to confess. Her mind wrestled with the thought for the whole day. By evening, she had decided to confess her mistake and apologize.

The next morning, she walked into her boss's office, her heart pounding in her chest. With a shaking voice and tears brimming in her eyes, she confessed her error and its cover-up. She stammered through an apology, desperately hoping for some understanding and forgiveness. She could see the surprise and disappointment in her boss's eyes, but she also saw a glimmer of understanding. Her boss didn't say anything for a moment, and then finally, he accepted her apology.

In the aftermath of the confession, Charlotte felt a strange sense of relief. She knew there would be consequences to face for her actions, but the liberating feeling of unburdening herself outweighed the fear. The lesson she learned from this incident was far more valuable than her previous relentless pursuit of perfection. Sometimes, acknowledging our mistakes and seeking forgiveness is far more courageous than striving to be flawless.","267,236,282,212,288,240,215,253,235,259,93,165,304,180,319,289,167,197,22,124,257,8,309,262,110,36,7,126,137,151,143,57,266,335,258,251,133,134,58,287,273,21,106,27,303,47,116,206,3,6,250,65,201,121,314,275,245,213,183,26,292,327,109,322,74,315,200,181,14,182,130,18,173,229,276,19,85,16,92,176,97,63,301,214,243,210,105,271,152,283,17,195,198,308,113,117,306,185,108,95,82,270,305,86,25,60,187,71,231,244,163,221,94,225,34,72,263,329,334,37,321,246,44,228,127,169,10,120,15,53,54,61,78,13,255,268,12,190,278,331,248,111,46,67,247,222,87,170,332,285,297,43,202,79,142,100,84,191,131,136,38,324,148,172,269,32,141,160,232,29,279,291,64,188,4,223,196,220,35,219,138,242,107,88,96,312,45,192,337,132,39,101,42,178,174,294,77,307,73,311","71,159,190,37,38","1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198"
136,"Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.","John had always been a hard worker. Since his first job in a grocery store at sixteen, he had managed to put aside a few dollars every month. His dream was to accumulate enough wealth to ensure a comfortable future for his family. Now, at 45, he had a decent amount of money saved up and started contemplating investing in the stock market. 

Inspired by stories of the few who had become incredibly wealthy off just a few savvy trades, John started researching various stocks. He read financial journals and watched hours of financial analysis on television. He considered investing all his savings into one profitable-looking company's stocks. It appeared to him as a quick way to escalate his wealth.

Around this time, his wise old neighbor, Mr. Miller, paid him a visit. As they sat on John's porch, sipping iced tea in the summer heat, John shared his investment plans. Listening to John's strategy, Mr. Miller looked at him thoughtfully and said, ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market. You should never put all your eggs in one basket."" 

John was taken aback; he hadn't expected such advice. In his mind, he was preparing himself for an influx of wealth. Mr. Miller, sensing his skepticism, decided to share his own story. 

He had once been a wealthy businessman but made the mistake of investing all his money into one single venture. Unfortunately, the business took a severe hit, and he lost almost everything. He had to rebuild his life from scratch, learning a painful lesson in diversification.

Listening to Mr. Miller's story, John reevaluated his plan. He realized the danger of placing all his trust and savings in the unpredictable stock market. He recognized the risk of losing everything he had worked for over the years if the company he invested in suffered a significant loss.

So, he decided to tread more cautiously. He studied different investment options like bonds, real estate, and mutual funds. He realized that diversifying his portfolio across these different sectors would help insulate him from a catastrophic loss in any single one. 

John did invest a portion of his savings in the stock market but also put money into real estate and bonds. As years passed, his diverse investment portfolio thrived, making him financially secure. He was grateful to Mr. Miller for teaching him the invaluable lesson of not putting all his eggs in one basket, forever changing the course of his financial future.","151,178,203,149,217,273,108,152,150,246,30,249,321,297,31,106,245,308,139,258,198,43,201,284,3,156,307,67,220,302,59,194,119,62,315,200,105,126,196,93,69,146,325,154,328,15,209,167,0,281,256,204,185,115,109,197,116,317,214,22,76,131,114,303,165,21,182,309,327,332,155,186,68,25,39,265,192,270,174,82,175,127,33,101,26,61,29,13,301,159,9,253,141,143,324,44,335,282,231,148,190,311,168,326,138,34,28,222,88,89,240,255,173,40,199,16,166,336,312,330,49,230,162,5,237,55,232,32,293,85,331,225,99,145,269,73,275,181,215,318,137,290,171,87,202,142,60,118,74,12,234,261,313,176,123,334,259,47,338,83,160,130,286,279,248,129,228,337,24,295,11,187,86,65,70,117,104,140,306,107,51,205,277,103,287,254,314,257,264,250,268,288,10,243,238,219,262,111,170,289","141,105,19,178,93","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
137,It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.,"In a small suburban town lived a young man named Aaron. He had recently graduated with a degree in computer engineering. However, he found himself entranced by only one company, XTech Inc, the most popular tech giant in the city.

Aaron felt a sense of admiration for XTech Inc because of their innovative solutions and world-class products. His dream was to join their software development team, where he believed his creativity and technical skills would shine. But his father, a seasoned business executive, had a different advice for him.

One evening, Aaron and his father were sitting in their home study room. His father looked over at him and said, ""Aaron, it would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.""

Taken aback, Aaron questioned his father's advice, ""But, Dad, I really want to work at XTech Inc. Why should I apply to other companies?""

His father, with a knowing smile, started to explain, ""You see, Aaron, putting all your hopes on one company could end up in disappointment. Applying to several companies will increase your chances of success.""

Aaron, though reluctant, decided to heed his father's advice. He started researching about other tech companies, in and around his city. Days turned into weeks, and he found himself applying to several companies, each having its unique aura of innovation.

He tailored his resumes and cover letters according to the company's needs and roles they were offering. The process was tedious, but he started to see the wisdom in his father's advice. He felt more confident and prepared as he was exposing himself to a variety of interview processes and company cultures.

Surprisingly, Aaron began to receive responses from some of the companies. Each interview opportunity pushed him further out of his comfort zone, making him more polished and adaptable. He was learning much more than he anticipated. 

In a turn of events, XTech Inc also invited Aaron for an interview. He was ecstatic but also understood the importance of his other opportunities. As the interviews proceeded, he was able to leverage the experiences from his previous interviews at XTech Inc, boosting his performance significantly.

Aaron received several job offers but ultimately, his dream came true when XTech Inc offered him a position. His joy knew no bounds, but he was also grateful for the other offers he had. It helped him negotiate a better package at XTech Inc, solidifying his position.

It was then he truly understood his father's advice. Applying to multiple companies had not only increased his chances but had also honed his skills and confidence. He realized that focusing only on one company could have limited his growth. It was a valuable lesson of diversification and taking risks that would guide him throughout his career.","17,155,286,50,48,170,108,116,12,63,106,309,156,154,264,159,231,136,190,72,202,307,177,281,31,217,62,32,224,149,89,209,91,206,287,139,133,26,337,247,2,125,211,111,220,233,1,199,121,109,52,123,150,169,73,207,127,29,147,160,310,300,158,163,228,244,172,183,10,274,187,239,128,167,236,325,212,97,60,280,118,225,76,276,59,269,179,196,232,200,77,338,301,193,323,0,221,33,124,25,19,39,15,259,105,243,78,198,322,43,327,103,226,88,277,242,181,92,283,5,299,45,30,188,261,195,203,135,255,320,75,94,248,82,49,317,16,292,222,235,27,3,41,215,140,132,51,151,14,117,321,302,24,278,254,98,330,23,101,20,238,328,291,152,47,208,332,175,129,161,38,313,131,298,113,134,297,256,272,186,268,66,44,331,120,262,141,21,55,253,53,336,214,197,185,166,219,138,8,18","18,198,36,145,187","1, 5, 18, 28, 34, 48, 63, 75, 78, 83, 98, 107, 119, 134, 152, 158, 172, 183, 187, 197"
138,"He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was ruined. He realized that he should have had other backup plans.","Once upon a time, in a bustling city, lived an aspiring entrepreneur named Richard. He was a man of vision and ambition. He had made a substantial investment in his latest project, a venture he was certain would skyrocket him to financial prosperity. This project was not just an economic ambition but a sentimental one as well. Richard's entire life savings and years of blood, sweat, and tears were heavily invested in it.

It was a revolutionary idea, a platform that aimed to streamline online shopping for consumers, making it more efficient and consumer-friendly. He had conducted several market surveys, and each one suggested that the product would be a massive hit. He was positively brimming with hope, his confidence reaching its pinnacle. The anticipation of his venture's success made him ignore the need for having backup plans. Richard believed that this was his golden ticket to financial freedom.

The launch day arrived, and Richard felt a sense of nervous excitement. The first few weeks went well, and Richard's venture saw a steady, albeit small, stream of consumers. The initial response was positive, and Richard believed that it was only a matter of time before the project took off.

However, things started to take a downward turn. A couple of months down the line, a few glitches in the platform started showing up. Customers began to complain about these issues, and the user count started dwindling. Despite his frantic attempts to salvage the situation, the problems persisted.

While Richard was grappling with this, a well-established company launched a similar, more efficient platform. This company had a more sophisticated infrastructure and resources to address glitches rapidly. As a result, Richard's customers began to shift to this new platform.

He tried to hold on, to fight for his vision, but it was like trying to hold water in his fists. It simply trickled away. Eventually, his platform collapsed, and his dream venture ended up in shambles.

The failure had catastrophic effects on Richard's life. He was ruined, both financially and emotionally. His life savings had been invested in the venture, and with its collapse, he was left with nothing. His dreams of financial prosperity were shattered, and he was plunged into a deep abyss of despair.

In the silence that followed the debacle, Richard began to realize his mistake. He had put all his eggs in one basket, believing that his venture was infallible. His overconfidence in his venture's success had caused him to overlook the importance of backup plans. 

Richard regretted his foolishness in not planning for contingencies. He understood that he had lost not because his idea was wrong but because he hadn't prepared for possible failure. It was a harsh lesson learned, a reminder of the importance of diversification and the inherent unpredictability of the business world. From then on, Richard decided that he would never make such a mistake again. He would be ready for failure, even as he strived for success.","55,277,294,225,220,70,248,106,167,298,130,108,132,326,337,76,29,264,125,260,60,242,162,159,244,296,274,201,124,6,249,300,204,180,269,137,103,53,47,80,318,135,236,309,28,311,62,208,239,283,97,292,270,271,284,48,122,206,22,293,69,188,59,331,173,241,160,74,172,219,291,339,66,250,226,228,176,263,0,317,221,18,94,13,21,140,181,175,230,303,52,25,45,186,321,200,152,141,322,266,88,191,205,113,9,190,243,139,193,259,142,34,155,42,215,164,282,95,2,147,126,63,75,64,78,332,154,118,265,184,295,72,133,325,89,246,17,314,210,199,240,315,217,261,136,149,110,31,267,96,40,319,198,83,336,10,116,272,101,256,51,115,119,182,117,189,12,49,39,185,81,288,86,82,26,143,73,148,222,334,107,16,304,98,194,328,177,312,290,327,229,7,3,38,33,192,44,297,333,278","145,36,108,86,98","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
139,"It is important to keep learning new skills and not rely on one skill for your career. With emerging technology, current skills may become outdated in the future.","John had always loved computers. Ever since he was a little boy, the buzz of the startup screen and the click of the keys had brought him immense joy. His fascination for computers led him to pursue a career in software programming, specializing in the programming language of the time - COBOL. He loved the logical construction of the language and was renowned as an expert in his field. He felt secure in his career and was confident that his skill would ensure a steady flow of income.

As he entered his mid-thirties, however, he noticed something unsettling. The software industry was rapidly evolving and the programming language he had mastered was getting outdated. New technologies and languages were emerging at an unprecedented pace, rendering his primary skill less useful with each passing day. 

He began to panic, seeing his colleagues adeptly navigating through these new languages with ease. The IT industry, which was once his playground, started becoming a challenge. He felt outpaced by the younger generation who were proficient with newer languages and technology. His complacency had led to a stagnation in his career growth and he found himself facing an unforeseen dilemma.

Then, he came across an article one day. It stated, ""It is important to keep learning new skills and not rely on one skill for your career. With emerging technology, current skills may become outdated in the future."" The words resonated with him deeply. He realized his fixation on COBOL had made him complacent and resistant to change.

Fueled by a new understanding, John decided to overcome his fear of learning new languages. He enrolled himself in various online courses, started attending tech meetups, and began interacting with his younger colleagues, asking them about the technologies they were working on.

Slowly but surely, John started getting a grasp of the new languages. He learned Python, JavaScript, and even delved into machine learning algorithms. Not only did he adapt to the change, but he also began enjoying the thrill of learning new things. 

John’s story served as an example to his colleagues. They saw how he transitioned from an outdated language expert to an all-round developer, able to code in multiple languages and adapt to new technologies. His dedication and constant urge to learn new skills also changed the way he was perceived by his younger colleagues. He became a mentor to many, sharing his knowledge and encouraging them to always keep learning.

In retrospect, John was grateful for the wake-up call. He understood that in a rapidly evolving world, it was indeed important to keep learning new skills. He could see now that relying on one skill for your career is a dangerous strategy because with the emergence of new technology, current skills may become outdated in the future. John’s story serves as a reminder to all professionals, regardless of their field, that constant learning and adaptation is the key to stay relevant and successful in their careers.","11,231,289,113,98,264,62,268,277,270,91,254,26,181,5,52,83,303,97,133,14,328,140,252,307,74,169,209,172,207,8,40,150,21,184,90,156,87,331,220,1,15,216,31,225,141,73,188,123,151,147,249,136,217,298,118,321,242,301,99,279,243,339,276,292,100,36,106,34,138,2,171,69,112,60,257,218,256,32,42,316,179,168,185,57,267,335,323,0,304,251,56,283,336,214,50,22,153,308,253,89,41,240,142,127,208,285,53,234,299,219,167,46,311,180,263,20,312,102,176,165,281,190,286,29,246,6,24,278,115,262,131,192,67,330,3,27,223,177,189,329,229,232,110,49,68,196,309,226,324,157,18,135,245,202,295,239,183,35,13,119,134,155,320,284,122,44,205,77,7,174,250,224,66,287,332,186,300,101,282,163,130,94,198,247,241,197,58,187,107,265,204,47,84,322,233,137,182,319,51","53,197,70,23,46","1, 4, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"

Different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.","In the nuanced sphere of family planning, it's astutely wise not to put all your eggs in one basket and trust just one childcare method. Ensuring the best for your child, it's beneficial to incorporate various techniques and strategies, keeping in mind that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.

In the heart of the bustling city lived the Johnson family. The parents, Martha and John, were awaiting the birth of their first child. They started discussing family planning and childcare methods, realizing that their differing opinions could either spark conflict or enrich their child's upbringing.

Martha, a high-flying corporate lawyer, believed in the traditional parenting method. She felt that discipline, structured routines, and clear boundaries were fundamental to shaping a well-adjusted child. On the other hand, John, an artist with a vibrant creative soul, leaned towards a more laissez-faire approach. He believed in giving children a significant level of freedom to explore, experiment, and learn at their own pace.

As the days passed, the discussions turned heated, with both wanting to enforce their parenting style without considering the other's perspective. But one day, while browsing through a child development book, Martha stumbled upon a nugget of wisdom. It suggested the importance of mixing various parenting styles, explaining that this diversity could contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.

She took the book to John, who read the concept with curiosity. They began understanding that each method had its benefits and drawbacks. More importantly, they understood that as parents, they would need to be flexible, adaptable, and willing to learn along the way.

Martha and John soon became an embodiment of what effective co-parenting should look like. They came up with a strategy, meticulously blending Martha's structure and discipline with John's freedom and creativity. Together, they built a robust and flexible parenting model, recognizing that circumstances change and every situation may require different reactions.

As their little one grew, they saw the benefits of their hybrid style. Their daughter learned to respect rules and structure from Martha but also inherited the love for creativity and exploration from John. She displayed emotional intelligence, resilience, adaptability, and innovation, traits that were a result of the balance in parenting styles she was brought up with.

Their experience taught them a valuable lesson in family planning. It's never about choosing one method over the other. Instead, it's about finding a harmonious balance that suits your family best. Ultimately, this journey helped shape a well-rounded individual in their child, reinforcing the wisdom of not relying on just one childcare method.","293,122,111,54,186,61,258,110,275,265,107,30,219,94,289,8,193,125,42,215,31,13,244,103,233,267,124,62,220,73,323,250,68,284,249,75,90,102,228,45,310,251,236,138,155,88,120,316,336,95,312,143,248,256,112,300,180,202,239,97,169,158,47,153,146,37,132,257,98,266,91,314,15,14,79,40,136,34,4,148,53,196,337,69,240,58,71,5,178,133,305,274,11,247,237,322,170,12,113,203,288,52,137,163,39,165,338,115,67,10,9,211,89,32,188,130,179,255,118,197,198,44,117,6,127,280,315,109,185,296,276,106,281,230,259,304,194,116,331,139,324,201,141,50,209,306,335,57,131,174,16,64,235,85,101,217,245,161,192,334,241,199,277,26,330,301,254,272,253,121,232,200,152,35,129,128,105,279,238,292,46,150,70,119,93,181,184,303,332,0,23,96,246,126,309,78,166,77,33,206","77,103,44,140,143","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"

She was a part of several communities - a book club, a jazz music lovers group, a biking club, a tech enthusiasts group, and a cooking club. These clubs weren't just her pastime. They were gateways to experiencing different perspectives and learning new things.

Every Tuesday evening, Linda would join her book club at the local library. Here, she would meet people from diverse age groups, from college students to retirees, engaging in discussions about everything from classic literature to contemporary fiction. This exchange of ideas not only widened her knowledge but also sparked lively debates and intellectual challenges.

On Friday nights, Linda attended jazz nights at the local club with her music lovers group. They weren't just fans, but included musicians, artists, and writers. Each person in this group had a unique take on music, some saw it as an escape, others as a source of inspiration. This made Linda see and appreciate music in ways she had never considered before.

On the weekends, Linda enjoyed scenic rides around the city with her biking group. This wasn't about speed or competition; rather, it was about taking time to enjoy the city's architecture and cultural attractions. Here, Linda got to meet people who taught her the importance of living in the moment, slowing down, and embracing nature's beauty.

The tech enthusiasts group Linda was part of met once a month. Here, Linda was amongst tech whizzes, coding enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and even people from the finance sector who were keen on understanding the tech world. This group helped her stay updated on technology trends and widened her understanding of the fast-paced digital world.

Finally, every Sunday evening, Linda attended the cooking club at a local community center. Here, she met chefs, food bloggers, nutritionists, and home cooks. They all came together to share recipes, cooking techniques, and most importantly, stories behind their culinary passion. Linda was able to learn cooking skills, but more importantly, the art of sharing and caring through food.

For Linda, all these diverse social groups were about more than just shared interests. Each group offered a distinct set of experiences and learnings. Linda truly believed that having different social groups helped her enjoy all the things she liked with different kinds of people. This opened up her world, challenged her perspectives, and taught her about the beauty of diversity in everyday life.","168,232,268,235,152,33,296,254,136,290,320,51,122,162,159,138,288,66,241,59,256,137,188,3,27,10,192,17,201,258,37,298,160,54,64,96,284,106,225,88,142,172,125,46,281,28,139,246,200,283,67,259,269,199,270,224,243,79,153,252,62,111,183,325,234,52,271,58,324,223,158,215,244,248,197,295,322,175,123,275,31,115,195,22,8,233,291,135,303,165,300,240,4,265,299,32,297,217,63,211,7,338,143,13,47,294,85,245,71,75,116,198,97,173,30,61,126,251,208,11,128,48,112,253,262,229,339,257,140,308,72,117,95,83,161,151,218,174,280,289,70,110,328,29,222,302,203,321,261,145,80,23,53,312,292,41,69,282,204,2,264,231,220,214,39,191,179,326,149,100,43,93,163,166,1,154,25,210,16,238,221,331,337,301,134,185,9,147,45,24,90,81,182,260,190,237,148,99,177,236","9,22,16,47,129","1, 3, 10, 17, 20, 22, 27, 31, 37, 44, 48, 55, 56, 63, 69, 70, 75, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 90, 95, 96, 97, 99, 102, 103, 104, 106, 108, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
142,"Don’t lie to land a job, remember that honesty is the best policy.","Once upon a time, there was a young man named Tom, fresh out of college and eager to get his first job. He was skilled in software development but lacked experience, something all the companies were specifically asking for. As his eagerness turned into desperation, a risky thought entered his mind.

His friend, Mark, offered him a dangerous piece of advice, ""Just embellish a little on your resume. Everybody does that.” Mark’s words planted a dubious seed in Tom’s mind. However, his father's words echoed louder in his mind, ""Don't lie to land a job, remember that honesty is the best policy.""

He spent the next few days in a moral struggle, wrestling with the two contrasting suggestions. Was it worth a small lie for landing a job? He pondered over it, as his future seemed to hang in the balance. But he knew that integrity was a character trait that he couldn't compromise on. 

Eventually, he decided to heed his father's advice, refusing to compromise his honesty. He resolved to represent himself sincerely on his resume and during his job interviews, no matter the outcome. He decided to present his genuine self, showcasing his skills and enthusiasm for learning, rather than fabricating experiences he did not possess.

His journey of job hunting continued, and he faced numerous rejections. Yet he persisted, refusing to let despair break his conviction. Every rejection was a stepping stone, a lesson for him to learn, grow and improve. 

After several attempts, he came across a start-up that was seeking fresh, enthusiastic developers, even if they didn’t have much experience. Seeing this as an opportunity, he applied and was called in for an interview.

During the interview, he was asked about his lack of experience, to which he responded honestly. He acknowledged his inexperience but also emphasized his willingness to learn. His honesty shined through his words, making a strong impression on the interview panel.

Impressed by Tom's integrity and eagerness to learn, they offered him the job. They valued his transparency, tenacity, and determination over fabricated experience. His choice to adhere to honesty had finally borne fruit. 

This job allowed Tom to gain the necessary experience and flourish in the field he loved. Not only did he get the job, but he also earned the respect of his peers for his honesty. His experience reminded him and everyone around that honesty is, indeed, the best policy, especially when trying to land a job.","310,62,172,167,38,75,223,112,259,180,41,254,140,104,300,185,93,305,275,307,153,37,109,301,284,24,332,23,171,95,0,200,77,224,9,297,57,199,157,150,35,33,189,47,165,206,263,183,144,319,10,234,138,7,111,65,298,72,312,60,158,50,79,28,303,241,233,193,97,229,154,61,182,179,186,249,250,237,6,335,240,258,336,155,147,66,204,264,15,208,98,102,4,145,163,243,230,323,216,222,272,143,170,331,39,106,231,244,329,322,318,108,54,214,43,70,25,196,251,210,302,56,21,232,333,164,328,151,17,87,29,115,63,225,149,174,46,89,74,176,84,101,220,191,311,59,309,78,228,122,313,148,217,26,73,64,177,82,198,80,270,207,261,135,22,96,100,36,168,94,136,190,90,334,274,267,152,218,83,146,118,195,166,315,266,288,129,19,127,236,184,137,226,282,292,253,159,76,133,156","102,49,94,180,85","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
143,Doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run.,"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, there was a young man named Tim. Tim worked as an architect at a prestigious firm, renowned for its designs and professionalism. Despite being a brilliant architect, Tim had one significant flaw: he was always in a rush. He believed that speed was key to productivity, often ignoring minute details in his haste to finish projects quickly.

At the firm, Tim was assigned a critical project. It was to design the structure for a state-of-the-art hospital. The client emphasized the need for an error-free, detailed design considering the hospital's crucial role. Tim took on the project with his usual zeal, aiming to finish it as quickly as possible.

While designing, Tim had a tendency to overlook small yet essential elements. He rushed through his plans, ignoring small errors and inconsistencies in his designs. He didn't bother to check his work thoroughly, believing that his speed would impress both his colleagues and clients. Unbeknownst to Tim, his approach was about to teach him a valuable lesson.

Two weeks passed, and Tim had completed his designs. He handed them over to his supervisors, confident in his expedited work. However, upon thorough scrutiny, his superiors noted several inconsistencies and errors in the design plans. The consequences of his hasty work were beginning to emerge.

The firm was severely embarrassed in front of the client due to the flaws in the design. The client pointed out that such errors could compromise the hospital's functionality in the long run. Their dissatisfaction was evident. The company's reputation was at stake, and so was Tim's position.

Regret washed over Tim as he realized the impact of his careless actions. He recognized his mistake of prioritizing speed over accuracy. He understood that his negligence could have resulted in serious problems in the future, jeopardizing the safety of the people who would be using the hospital.

Tim was given a chance to correct his mistakes. He decided to adopt a new approach - focusing on thoroughness and responsibility over speed. This change in his work process was not easy, but he persevered. He spent countless hours ensuring each detail in his design was perfect. This time, he made sure that no potential problem was overlooked.

When Tim presented his revised design, his supervisors were impressed by the meticulous attention to detail. The client was also pleased with the error-free design, praising the firm for their professionalism. The hospital was built based on Tim's design, and it functioned perfectly well for many years, without any significant problems.

In the end, Tim learned an invaluable lesson: doing work thoroughly and responsibly helps one avoid problems in the long run. This principle became his mantra, propelling him to new heights in his career. Tim's story serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of diligence and precision in any endeavor. His experience elucidated that speed without accuracy often leads to failure, whereas dedication and attention to detail ensures lasting success.","259,36,109,49,180,273,83,22,299,135,329,163,112,105,160,250,19,300,51,323,219,53,177,110,255,310,89,116,339,314,86,74,33,186,279,165,1,227,167,223,305,107,234,173,207,142,16,209,17,30,291,233,206,90,332,146,322,80,274,48,229,222,108,52,254,12,32,31,302,55,231,7,149,60,169,104,38,190,337,118,84,6,46,221,161,214,315,249,267,198,208,232,66,242,131,243,147,181,253,336,47,27,216,260,120,275,122,57,93,246,245,235,8,153,13,75,81,196,174,224,155,328,220,151,164,241,130,252,263,124,136,312,276,331,287,228,85,34,282,293,283,20,297,313,295,29,133,225,244,54,144,148,289,23,184,266,205,248,103,264,247,187,197,62,162,21,5,157,272,28,236,308,119,42,73,230,40,59,0,318,68,280,178,96,217,145,76,296,192,2,77,127,334,215,258,237,168,15,335,150","46,151,186,56,97","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
144,"Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.","In a world where power and position are often coveted, politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practiced art, an unfortunate, yet pervasive, aspect of political culture worldwide. The lies are usually clothed in eloquence, in grand promises that rarely meet actualization. Overtime, this has become an integral part of their identities, often leading them into a convoluted mess of problems. 

For instance, take a prominent senator. The senator, having been in the political sphere for over a decade, has mastered the art of deceit. His campaigns are filled with assurances of social change, of economic upliftment, and of improved quality of life for every citizen. However, behind these captivating promises is the bitter truth: his real aims are far removed from these societal changes. He is driven by a desire for power and authority, not the upliftment of the less fortunate. 

Sure enough, these lies work initially. Citizens vote in his favor, enticed by his sweet words and grand visions. They look forward to the senator’s reign, hopeful for change. Yet, as years pass, his fabricated promises begin to unravel. The promised social change is nowhere in sight. The economic condition of the city remains stagnant, if not worse. The lives of the citizens remain unchanged.

Soon enough, problems arise. People start raising questions, their hopeful eyes now filled with skepticism. They begin to distrust the senator, feeling betrayed and deceived. There are accusations of corruption, protests, and demands for his resignation. The senator, once a revered figure, is now embroiled in controversies and scandals.

All of this could have been avoided if he was sincere about his aims from the beginning. If he had stood in front of his constituents and honestly revealed his plans and aspirations, he wouldn't have had to face their wrath. Even if those plans were less spectacular than his fabricated promises, sincerity has its own appeal. 

The citizens, tired of deceit, would appreciate a politician who spoke honestly. They would respect someone who admitted their limitations, yet promised to work sincerely towards the betterment of the society. They might not win over everyone, but their integrity would undeniably draw a loyal following. 

Indeed, it would be possible for such politicians to win not just one, but many elections. Their sincerity would be their strongest card, their unwavering honesty, a beacon of hope. If only they realized that truth holds more power than deceit, they could lead with courage and dignity, respected not feared, loved not despised. Regrettably, this ideal remains a distant dream. The tradition of political deceit continues, leading politicians into the same troublesome cycle over and over again. Yet, hope persists - hope for a world where politicians are sincere about their aims and honest in their actions.","184,296,126,130,215,275,289,315,282,193,7,66,304,60,85,88,52,242,230,182,162,150,219,79,147,105,199,160,173,38,148,71,200,322,217,243,16,165,287,197,168,67,125,61,308,292,170,297,77,327,299,53,295,320,101,64,145,117,278,81,183,157,20,338,166,80,100,191,194,236,227,192,339,21,189,121,12,317,102,22,298,104,220,133,246,153,312,248,75,161,185,277,301,234,94,309,288,186,264,267,167,169,54,159,281,233,305,196,229,228,211,95,156,135,207,152,26,337,132,139,42,11,334,63,14,83,175,188,36,129,44,332,37,313,146,316,241,270,127,113,74,290,103,285,32,268,25,198,8,307,57,202,179,258,244,328,141,46,216,204,271,143,201,18,6,213,154,266,176,178,99,106,142,35,250,260,27,28,73,276,155,122,210,134,237,87,5,333,136,128,23,19,45,172,151,10,261,82,251,259","173,162,57,135,25","1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
145,Jane advised a worried Jill that she would feel better after owning up to the mistake.,"Jill had been feeling heavy-hearted for several days, her thoughts constantly revolving around a significant mistake she had made. It was in her workplace where she was revered for her impeccable performance. It was a grave error that risked the reputation of her team, an act of negligence she couldn't believe she had committed.

Her long-time friend and coworker, Jane, was aware of her disposition. She knew Jill very well and could tell when something was weighing on her mind. She had always admired Jill for her competence and the care she put into her work, but she also understood that nobody was free from errors.

One afternoon, Jane decided to sit down with Jill during lunch. She looked at Jill’s haggard face, expressing concern. Jane decided to break the silence by asking Jill what was bothering her.

""I made a terrible mistake at work, Jane,"" Jill admitted, her voice breaking. Her eyes filled with regret, and she relayed the details of her mishap, of the data she mishandled and the potential damage it might cause.

Jane nodded as she listened, her eyes softening with understanding and empathy. She knew that everyone has weak moments, that no one is above mistakes. What was essential was how one handled the aftermath. She then took a deep breath before giving Jill some advice that she hoped would alleviate her angst.

""Jill,"" Jane began, her voice calm, yet authoritative. ""We all make mistakes. The essential thing is not to dwell on the mistake but to learn from it.""

Jane's advice made sense. Jill needed to own up to her error, apologize, and assure her team that she would prevent such a mistake from recurring. Jane believed that this would not only lift the burden from Jill's heart but also enhance her credibility and integrity.

Jill took her friend's advice to heart. Although it took some courage, she reported her error to her superior the next morning. She explained the incident without making any excuses, and she presented a concrete plan on how such a situation could be avoided in the future.

Her team was understandably upset at first, but her sincerity, responsibility, and her plan of action reassured them. Over time, the incident helped them work even better as a team, and Jill found herself feeling significantly relieved. 

Jane’s advice, it seemed, was exactly what she needed to hear. She had indeed felt better after owning up to her mistake. It was a tough lesson for Jill, but it was a lesson well-learned. It made her a more resilient professional, demonstrating the power of honesty, integrity, and the courage to admit when you're wrong.","312,151,283,215,231,272,139,317,185,123,302,161,184,179,234,69,187,292,99,307,28,12,0,59,96,290,132,70,134,332,325,55,241,334,271,98,152,93,95,195,167,81,230,109,163,65,91,279,17,130,275,201,149,214,229,186,88,104,84,258,122,171,181,5,105,14,329,153,72,222,200,194,193,313,293,116,206,260,83,20,143,51,301,225,137,326,336,97,3,19,158,24,133,15,338,337,335,113,237,39,44,18,41,173,209,182,228,102,236,180,235,68,8,204,285,316,263,220,267,75,7,274,35,78,199,242,144,238,63,299,281,287,119,23,25,264,192,50,74,297,309,227,80,223,31,79,270,142,34,205,246,212,330,266,140,243,168,289,36,296,245,250,339,100,125,121,10,66,118,56,291,240,288,77,148,203,71,85,219,232,101,159,331,128,156,254,253,16,189,47,262,147,198,33,146,115,328,306,11,269","148,81,127,195,192","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
146,"Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time.","In a small, tight-knit community, there were two teenagers, Liam and Lary, who both aspired to get into the prestigious Stonebridge Academy. The school was not only known for its exceptional educational standards, but it also had a reputation for accepting only students with exemplary records.

Liam was a cunning, street-smart boy who saw opportunity where others saw obstacles. On the other hand, Lary was a sincere, diligent lad who believed in earning his success the right way. Both aimed to get into Stonebridge, albeit through very different approaches.

Liam, knowing his not-so-stellar academic record and lack of extra-curricular achievements wouldn't stand a chance against the rigorous admission process, decided to do the unthinkable. He decided to forge his documents and present a picture-perfect student profile that Stonebridge couldn't resist. Armed with a fake portfolio, he made it through the admission process, his heart pounding in his chest.

Meanwhile, Lary, who had been working hard throughout his school years, submitted his honest yet impressive profile, along with several recommendations from his teachers. His strong academic results and extraordinary participation in a variety of school activities spoke for themselves. He was delighted when he received his acceptance letter, all his hard work had finally paid off.

The boys began their new school life at Stonebridge. Liam had a difficult time keeping his lie hidden. The constant fear of being discovered and the stress of maintaining his fake persona began to take its toll. He found it difficult to partake in casual conversations, always fearing he might let something slip about his deception. At night, he lay awake, his mind filled with frightening scenarios of potential exposure.

Conversely, Lary was free from such burdens. Without any weighty secrets to keep hidden, he enjoyed his new life at Stonebridge to the fullest. He thrived in the environment and seized the opportunities that came his way. Lary made many friends, participated actively in school events, and his grades remained impeccable, much to his satisfaction.

One had to constantly watch his back, careful not to reveal his fraudulent admission, the other, basking in the joy of his hard-earned success, flourishing in the vibrant environment of the academy. As each day passed, the contrast between their experiences became more evident.

Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time. Their choices leading them down very different paths in the same environment.","98,317,230,192,115,37,289,270,231,143,152,30,131,195,145,55,29,219,253,137,262,59,263,101,165,293,249,33,121,80,182,12,248,328,222,20,184,280,135,336,315,92,308,291,68,277,73,76,285,2,106,85,237,261,166,71,216,254,162,172,286,15,21,28,53,251,90,304,38,307,302,318,168,252,34,125,180,325,183,185,57,334,238,7,338,214,239,310,275,190,273,10,327,303,175,206,294,65,204,319,257,197,322,134,259,337,212,108,52,95,215,339,226,16,127,150,118,31,171,124,224,164,272,36,62,241,17,225,268,148,279,5,27,142,258,105,333,11,189,223,264,0,43,179,144,19,139,282,167,109,13,284,114,213,77,321,221,69,200,149,281,306,174,48,151,163,41,178,266,75,24,203,288,202,330,256,332,50,247,132,147,232,44,287,301,299,128,240,103,46,133,47,235,176,211,72,314,116,89,320","134,10,145,15,181","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
147,"You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.","Once upon a time, in the small town of Marigold, there lived a boy named Liam. Liam was known among his peers for being mischievous. He had a peculiar way of bending rules to suit his whims and his actions often led to unique and unexpected outcomes. This led to many hilarious tales about Liam, circulating in the town's grapevine. However, one summer day, his mischievous behavior led to a serious issue that caused him a great deal of stress.

In their cozy home, on an oak shelf sat a precious antique vase. The vase was a prized possession of Liam's mother. She often remarked on its intricate design and vintage appeal, a testament to the artistic proficiency of their ancestors. However, for Liam, the vase was nothing more than a boring piece of decoration.

One sunny afternoon, while Liam was home alone, he was playing around with his football in the living room. He was practicing his aim, trying to get the ball through the door, and with his complete focus on the ball, he overlooked the fact that the vase was also in his aiming line.

With a powerful kick, Liam sent the football flying across the room. Instead of sailing through the doorway, it knocked over the precious antique vase. The beautiful piece of history shattered into tiny pieces with a heart-stopping crash. A wave of panic washed over Liam as he realized the magnitude of his mistake.

The stress became unbearable for Liam. Every time his mother passed the spot where the vase once proudly stood, his heart rate soared. He found himself thinking about it constantly, causing his grades to drop and his sleep to become restless.

Liam confided in his best friend, Mason about his predicament. Mason was a wise boy for his age and always had practical advice to give. After hearing out his friend, Mason suggested, ""You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.""

Liam pondered over his friend's suggestion. The stress had indeed become overwhelming. After much deliberation, he mustered the courage to confess his mistake to his mother.

He waited for the right moment and finally revealed what had happened to her cherished vase. His mother listened quietly and after a pause, she simply said, ""Accidents happen, Liam. I'm just glad you're safe and that you had the courage to tell me the truth.""

Liam felt as though a massive weight had been lifted off his shoulders. His mother's gracious reaction surprised him and taught him the importance of truthfulness. From then onwards, Liam vowed to avoid his habit of mischief and be more responsible. His bond with his mother only grew stronger because he had chosen to be honest, even when it was the more difficult choice.","142,18,99,148,263,241,199,224,126,7,136,238,208,64,282,233,250,108,290,4,277,19,231,127,251,129,179,183,122,201,145,93,38,286,82,130,109,155,336,105,53,68,332,144,62,279,95,84,174,222,97,329,299,190,259,192,315,229,21,9,264,173,260,42,128,218,98,149,295,204,37,326,104,143,152,52,34,175,246,186,11,135,80,70,321,35,187,312,102,163,245,327,114,40,285,272,133,225,314,48,113,171,43,51,265,153,10,106,36,293,202,256,255,63,189,151,26,335,210,193,111,292,154,198,159,44,253,17,319,110,237,123,200,313,117,301,261,334,262,59,235,76,207,12,101,138,184,146,196,3,269,107,121,92,8,5,91,45,213,283,57,72,227,28,112,249,215,254,156,331,157,236,226,73,29,185,228,240,330,169,333,296,270,320,46,176,22,2,220,195,317,1,0,306,125,20,267,216,338,158","1,74,44,31,148","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
148,"Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.","Once upon a time, in the small town of Hillsdale, a student named Ben was known for his quickness in everything he did. He ran quickly, spoke quickly, and, most notably, always completed his assignments in record time. His friends marveled at this speed, often wondering how he managed to complete his assignments so quickly while they struggled to finish theirs. However, his teachers noticed a worrisome trend in his work. The assignments, despite being completed on time, lacked depth and attention to detail, and as a result, his grades suffered.

One day, his favorite teacher, Mrs. Bennett, decided to address the situation. ""Ben,"" she said, calling him after class, ""You seem to rush through your assignments. This speed is hurting your grades."" Ben looked puzzled. He thought his ability to complete assignments quickly was a boon, not a bane. But Mrs. Bennett, seeing his confusion, decided to explain further.

""Ben, you might've heard the saying 'haste makes waste.'"" Mrs. Bennett started, her eyes softened, making sure he was following. ""It means that doing things in a hurry, more often than not, leads to mistakes and poor-quality work. This is what's happening with your assignments."" Ben was still dubious. He had always valued speed. Could going slower really make that much of a difference?

Mrs. Bennett gave him a soft smile. ""Why don't we do an experiment?"" She suggested. ""For your next assignment, I want you to take your time. Read the questions carefully, think about your answers, and don't rush.""

The next day, Ben tried this out. For the first time, he read the assignment carefully, understood the questions thoroughly, and spent ample time crafting his answers. The process felt slow and laborious, but he stuck with it. It took him twice as long to complete, but he handed in his assignment the next day with a sense of accomplishment he hadn't felt before.

The day after, Mrs. Bennett returned the marked assignments. Ben's heart pounded as he flipped to see his grade. To his surprise, he received an A, the highest grade he'd received in months. Mrs. Bennett winked at him, ""See, Ben, quality over speed, always.""

Ben was elated. His friends were stunned. Ben had worked slower but achieved better results. They asked him about it and he explained about their teacher's advice.

From then on, Ben followed the principle of 'haste makes waste' in every aspect of his life. He no longer rushed through his assignments and took the time to understand and analyze each task. As a result, not only did his grades improve, but he also found that he enjoyed the learning process a lot more. It was a valuable lesson that he carried into adulthood, proving that slowing down can indeed lead to greater success.","239,228,202,292,82,89,175,49,124,303,162,221,87,298,33,199,72,300,172,187,150,35,120,36,18,128,200,151,304,261,2,50,224,256,232,69,332,109,226,247,71,12,266,7,108,95,48,118,116,302,225,105,13,268,309,242,179,331,132,74,323,182,155,152,337,320,86,289,17,177,329,64,274,10,167,11,37,92,38,324,147,245,293,28,276,60,252,5,310,336,243,181,299,230,319,31,278,139,214,130,146,195,8,22,65,209,94,41,265,67,194,79,201,183,313,119,212,99,178,249,54,88,133,125,153,264,27,135,66,306,52,216,103,39,220,231,241,156,218,204,246,258,101,81,311,70,123,250,90,62,163,267,141,227,149,85,159,188,186,279,240,56,213,80,291,63,43,248,236,190,219,222,106,191,314,59,281,29,164,112,173,269,102,14,57,21,111,203,294,78,301,104,270,330,326,272,317,170,127,180","155,21,28,64,125","1, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
149,Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.,"Larry was an affable man, always with a ready smile and a hearty laugh. He was part of a dedicated team of software developers at TechGenie, a small yet growing IT company. The one aspect that set him apart from the rest of his team was his penchant for jumping straight into work, bypassing the usual process of meticulous planning and reading the requirements.

His routine typically began with a fresh cup of coffee, a quick skim through the project details, then immediately diving into coding. For Larry, starting work instantly was akin to grasping the bull by its horns. His intention wasn't to cut corners or shirk responsibilities; he believed it gave him an edge to finish tasks earlier than his colleagues. 

A bit of a maverick, Larry had earned a reputation for his speedy deliveries. He basked in the self-proclaimed glory of being the fastest coder. Unbeknownst to him, his early completions were more of a bane than a boon.

His co-workers, despite appreciating his enthusiasm and speed, were often left in a lurch. Larry's work, because it was rushed without meticulous planning and understanding, always contained significant loopholes. His peers would find themselves untangling the mess created by Larry's hasty code, spending precious hours debugging and correcting his work. 

For instance, there was an incident involving a crucial application development project for a high-profile client. Larry had claimed ownership and started coding at the speed of light. In record time, he announced the project's completion, triumphantly attaching the 'done' label.

But when the testing team started reviewing his code, they found it fraught with errors and oversights. Numerous gaps were observed because Larry hadn't followed the client's specific requirements, leading to many reworks.

The project lead, Julia, had to intervene. She had the onerous task of assigning other team members to revise Larry's work. Each time this happened, it not only increased the workload of others but also upset the overall project schedule. 

Eventually, Larry’s perpetual errors sparked a discussion within the management. They had to find a solution to balance Larry's enthusiasm without compromising the quality of work.

The team decided on an approach that involved a peer review of Larry's understanding of project requirements before he began the coding process. They hoped that this would curb his rushed approach and enhance the quality of his work. The implementation of this process was a delicate task as they wanted to guide Larry without curbing his enthusiasm.

Despite the additional workload, the team members were optimistic about this change, hopeful it would resolve the ongoing issue. They believed it was crucial for Larry to understand that planning and reading the requirements was as significant as completing the task promptly. They hoped that, in the future, Larry's haste would be replaced with attention to detail, delivering quality work and benefiting the whole team.","330,276,5,247,78,88,61,145,79,105,130,209,134,122,242,125,212,255,249,83,303,152,160,294,274,326,2,56,154,163,283,189,129,205,333,67,58,164,93,147,4,111,121,151,250,252,235,181,86,148,48,94,222,84,227,12,62,120,44,60,7,96,63,206,211,180,313,327,195,216,10,291,37,265,230,267,232,36,100,236,153,19,336,248,155,218,302,243,307,91,201,116,89,273,312,325,306,290,197,14,87,141,82,73,301,175,137,142,135,332,268,215,226,123,258,3,270,188,263,32,257,68,41,54,95,166,132,90,85,238,266,176,219,338,103,172,287,311,50,81,334,117,297,150,293,0,76,75,168,65,25,30,21,315,16,124,138,39,18,97,192,198,34,245,272,157,199,26,339,53,228,46,317,225,143,289,305,31,9,320,24,185,47,99,51,71,204,170,165,77,29,45,171,224,186,43,136,104,324,52","50,144,44,22,81","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

But, now she needs to redo them as half of the class complained.","It was a rather busy day for Kim, a dedicated middle school teacher. She was responsible for a multitude of tasks; teaching classes, supervising after school clubs, participating in school meetings, and handling stacks of school work. Because of her tight schedule, she looked forward to the little pockets of free time she managed to carve out. 

One sunny afternoon, she was particularly swamped with grading papers for her seventh-grade science class. The daunting pile of assignments sat on her desk, staring back at her like an Everest to climb. Kim decided to expedite the process so that she could have some leisure time later in the evening. She wanted to watch her favorite show, wind down with a good book, or even just sit in silence for a while.

Kim hurriedly started going through the stack of papers, grading as fast as her hand could manage. The otherwise meticulous teacher was now more focused on finishing the task rather than ensuring the students' work was meticulously checked. Kim finally managed to finish the task, her hand throbbing with an impending cramp. She felt relieved and looked forward to enjoying her free time that evening.

The next day, she handed back the papers to her students, hoping she could continue with her next lesson without any hurdles. However, soon her hopes were shattered. 

Half of the class seemed dissatisfied as they examined their graded assignments. Whispers turned into discussions, and before she knew it, there were open complaints about the unfair grading and points that were missed. Some students were bordering on revolt, insisting that their work had not been thoroughly checked.

A sinking feeling washed over Kim. She hadn't anticipated her rush to have free time would turn against her in such a way. She realized her mistake; her eagerness to finish quickly had resulted in the compromise of her duty. 

With a heavy heart, she agreed to regrade the assignments. She apologized to her class for the oversight and assured them she would spend the necessary time to give each paper its due attention.

That night, instead of relaxing, Kim sat again with the towering stack of papers, her back bent and eyes strained. It was a sobering lesson for Kim about the importance of her responsibilities, one she was unlikely to forget anytime soon.

However, on the upside, as she meticulously corrected each paper, she discovered fascinating insights about her students' thought process and creative ideas. This made her realize that perhaps, in her quest for free time, she had been missing out on these small but essential aspects of her job.","114,220,318,92,194,186,280,40,190,151,153,75,286,162,233,64,155,297,109,59,288,248,208,316,179,253,134,262,252,212,193,127,333,274,31,129,185,17,305,96,210,4,83,205,261,77,241,171,203,117,135,115,296,74,234,204,265,97,195,14,60,202,209,124,197,256,79,175,66,273,141,9,102,225,45,173,279,100,116,268,260,90,301,201,327,263,49,192,272,178,222,42,20,73,177,163,235,198,133,29,26,284,50,65,71,335,276,245,270,123,180,238,87,303,167,302,125,249,19,312,6,21,99,16,338,0,329,98,68,215,227,287,63,314,11,2,289,103,51,226,24,91,292,118,146,282,27,161,88,61,120,277,200,37,307,300,126,144,85,147,56,236,191,218,216,299,184,321,267,283,152,30,166,306,165,264,149,237,240,223,148,232,52,168,44,196,290,317,110,18,244,101,159,34,33,10,36,258,323,1","181,177,10,171,11","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
151,The presentation was such a mess! The presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.,"It was a big day for the marketing team of Elixer Enterprises, the day they had all been working towards for months. They had been tasked with the daunting job of presenting their revolutionary product to the board members and potential investors. The team had put in countless hours of preparation, researching, revising, practicing, and finalizing the presentation. The anxiety and excitement had been building over weeks and had now reached its pinnacle as the team stood nervously on the stage.

The lead presenter, James, armed with a clicker, began by introducing their product. An innovative solution that would revolutionize the tech industry, but as he started diving into the specifics, it started to go awry. Rather than a clear, concise explanation of their product, the presentation seemed to be a barrage of information, thrown out all at once.

Each slide seemed cluttered and overcrowded with too many images and endless bullet points. Charts and graphs flew in from every direction, each with far too many parameters and in the rush to convey the product's many features, the presenters started speaking too fast. Each sentence seemed to bleed into the next, making it harder for the audience to follow along. The presenters tried to convey too much information in such a short time that there was no clarity.

The audience's faces revealed their confusion. Even the CEO, known for his eagle-eyed attention to detail, seemed lost in the whirlwind of data. The investors, potential lifelines for the project, started looking at their watches, their interest clearly waning.

As the presentation dragged on, so did the feeling of discomfort in the room. The team knew their presentation was becoming a mess, but they were too deep into it to backtrack. Instead, they hoped their enthusiasm would carry them through.

As they attempted to explain their unique algorithms and state-of-the-art coding techniques, the jargon became too much for the non-technical audience. There were puzzled looks, furrowed brows, and deep sighs among the executives and investors. It seemed clear that the presentation was not having its intended impact.

The final slide flashed onto the screen and James concluded the presentation. A quiet applause followed, clearly out of politeness rather than admiration or interest. The marketing team slumped off the stage, their expressions mirroring the chaos of their presentation. 

The presentation was such a mess. A classic example of overwhelming the audience with too much information in too short a time. As they regrouped, the team couldn't help but replay the disastrous presentation in their minds, thinking about what could have been if only they had focused on clarity rather than quantity of information. It was a harsh lesson learned, and one they would never forget.","284,255,278,161,20,35,36,137,331,245,99,280,271,269,68,265,193,118,96,174,242,237,244,120,258,159,181,256,50,279,194,241,152,94,146,165,296,251,79,292,75,216,154,112,201,150,207,206,122,282,273,249,330,259,169,134,147,145,304,121,107,93,322,267,285,2,262,204,275,109,141,230,310,56,123,142,22,191,98,189,175,63,153,205,171,162,24,298,149,17,179,190,80,195,247,155,45,55,70,47,222,196,167,313,16,148,208,128,73,170,110,81,52,66,23,277,219,88,252,10,302,26,307,67,127,178,11,294,59,71,198,5,135,156,221,183,305,203,160,114,77,115,138,240,82,225,266,53,76,132,136,9,224,321,229,86,139,65,223,311,186,28,264,38,92,212,7,15,299,21,209,41,327,200,228,211,182,105,272,61,0,101,214,180,116,188,30,184,232,319,13,332,309,34,260,238,176,119,42,74","106,89,46,33,83","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
152,"These files require a throrough look, don't skim through them quickly.","As a new employee at Jennings & Associates, a renowned law firm, Alex had been assigned his first case. The case was a convoluted corporate lawsuit involving two tech giants. He was handed a stack of files by his supervisor, Mr. Simmons. As he handed over the pile, Mr. Simmons pointedly said, ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly.""

Taking his advice seriously, Alex decided to dedicate a substantial amount of his time to investigate every detail within the files. He returned to his desk, feeling a weight of responsibility bearing down on him. The files were old and thick, some held together by rusting paper clips, others were bound in binders that had yellowed with age.

Starting from the first file, he meticulously read through every page, making sure he was not missing out on any crucial detail. The office clock ticked relentlessly, its hands spinning in rhythm with the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. Hours passed, Alex's desk was soon littered with empty coffee cups and crumpled snack wrappers. His focus never wavered.

By the third day, his colleagues began to notice his relentless dedication. Some admired it, while others saw it as a naive commitment of a newbie. But Alex was unfazed by their opinions. The words of Mr. Simmons kept ringing in his ears; he knew he had to maintain his rigorous approach.

Each file brought with it new revelations, intricate details that only revealed themselves to someone paying careful attention. Alex began to understand the depth and complexity of the lawsuit. Multiple accusations of copyright infringement, hidden subcontracts, and a labyrinthine web of corporate politics, the case was anything but straightforward.

By the end of the week, Alex had completely absorbed himself in the intricacies of the case. The office was often dark and empty by the time he left, the only light remaining was the one above his desk. His tireless scrutiny of the case was paying off. He had uncovered several unnoticed details and loopholes that could turn the tide of the case in their favor.

Mr. Simmons noticed Alex’s diligence. He saw the perseverance of a potential great lawyer. After all, he hadn’t advised him to be thorough without reason. He knew that a careful and meticulous examination of the case would be crucial in court.

Finally, when Alex presented his findings, Mr. Simmons couldn't hide his satisfaction. He appreciated Alex’s doggedness and depth of knowledge. His praise was well deserved, and the office couldn’t ignore the praise of the formidable Mr. Simmons. Alex’s thorough perusal of the files had indeed made a difference. From then on, ""Don't skim through them quickly"" became an unofficial mantra at Jennings & Associates.","163,239,190,324,130,46,244,204,230,114,119,188,41,209,140,151,205,52,88,55,101,60,231,226,102,182,179,177,265,297,121,326,135,139,241,192,155,69,62,17,321,253,103,213,27,283,61,122,270,173,64,108,267,8,148,275,30,150,223,311,296,5,181,87,106,93,263,164,86,279,149,293,184,242,186,220,40,44,76,29,19,202,248,15,113,50,162,338,246,286,317,91,75,117,225,316,22,18,170,167,137,74,216,82,284,211,288,56,142,120,96,126,23,58,7,277,229,285,133,236,310,178,171,153,172,299,280,6,308,67,33,335,4,20,195,185,53,251,158,276,266,73,43,95,175,281,28,305,314,290,272,298,2,260,219,68,262,129,11,258,259,143,132,131,157,71,160,292,274,100,112,224,78,169,218,318,154,212,315,13,333,39,234,327,198,99,105,197,328,312,70,80,330,303,294,278,337,269,306,136","55,71,58,16,124","1, 3, 6, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 160, 163, 166, 169, 172, 175, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193, 196, 199"
153,Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon.,"Marathon running is no trivial undertaking; it demands a strategic approach. The most important thing to remember is to maintain a steady pace throughout the race and avoid excessive running at the start. Starting too quickly can lead to premature exhaustion and consequently, a much slower overall time. Many first-time marathon runners make this mistake, only to pay the price later.

John was a first-time marathon runner. Like many amateur marathoners, he had trained extensively for the run. His friends, seasoned runners themselves, consistently stressed the importance of pacing. However, amid the adrenaline and enthusiasm of his first marathon, John made the classic error. 

As the starting gun sounded, his heart pounded with excitement. He could see the ribbon of runners stretching out ahead. Feeling invincible, he sprinted past many of them, full of energy and confidence. His training had gone well and he felt strong; the temptation to push harder was irresistible. Despite the little voice in his head reminding him of his friends' advice, he ignored it.

John started to feel the consequences of his decision about halfway through the marathon. His initial burst of energy had long evaporated, replaced with fatigue that pulled at his muscles. The runners he'd passed earlier were now easily overtaking him. His breaths became laborious, his legs heavy as lead. 

He slowed down considerably, trying to recover some energy, but he realized that he had expended too much in the early part of the race. With grim determination, he trudged along, his pace now a fraction of what it had been at the start. Each step was a painful reminder of the consequences of over-ambition.

Finally, he reached the finish line, hours after the leaders. His friends were there, their concerned faces turned into smiles of relief as they saw him approach. He could see the implicit 'I told you so' in their expressions but was too exhausted to care.

In the aftermath, John reflected on his first marathon experience. He recognized his initial mistake: he had not listened to the crucial advice about maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start. 

However, the experience was not entirely negative. He had learned an invaluable lesson on pacing, and the pain of his first marathon would always serve as a stark reminder. John decided to take his failure in stride, promising to be better prepared in his next marathon, to stay steady and controlled, and resist the temptation to sprint at the start. He was determined that the next marathon would be different.","264,148,20,184,75,278,26,151,176,261,43,133,103,337,79,252,134,281,101,62,152,54,160,224,115,266,164,320,24,272,85,317,128,243,149,304,195,13,211,310,256,291,174,33,313,308,8,48,218,334,175,23,318,131,143,124,4,81,171,154,70,199,97,331,47,165,123,309,188,206,301,257,138,3,189,9,144,251,306,260,280,253,2,16,150,302,82,319,142,46,136,193,244,284,198,25,31,250,100,194,235,19,87,92,22,275,107,294,40,332,104,45,324,307,110,27,127,207,83,140,263,292,12,321,173,279,102,329,137,204,328,335,246,222,57,162,67,233,21,73,216,93,325,95,69,32,60,139,230,282,219,166,192,59,258,333,0,35,99,145,11,61,30,215,89,141,227,109,80,271,293,132,238,113,37,312,120,311,228,247,305,295,39,74,185,234,5,270,66,276,118,208,314,6,214,117,202,129,296,298","2,35,85,8,21","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
154,"Walter failed his exam, but his father only responded, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk,"" when he arrived.","Walter, an eager but anxious student, had prepared fervently for the semester-end examination. His nights were filled with the murmuring whispers of pages turning and his study lamp was the only light in the dead of night. Deep into the dawn, Walter would be found immersed in his textbooks, eyes widened in tired determination.

The exam day dawned just like any other. Students gathered nervously outside the examination hall, amidst the chilling early morning wind. Walter was among them, fingers crossed, whispering silent prayers under his shaky breath. The exam paper arrived, as cold and unwelcome as the morning itself. Walter chewed at his pen, brow furrowed in focus.

Despite all his meticulous preparations, some questions left Walter confounded. He could feel the pressure mounting with every passing minute, his heart beating like a frantic drum against his ribs. A cloud of unease settled over him, engulfing his hopes.

Days after the exam, he would be found sitting despondent on his porch, haunted by the unanswered questions. The silence of the waiting days was more deafening than the hustle of the preparation nights. The anticipation gnawed at him, drawing out waves of stress and worry.

Finally, the day of reckoning arrived. Walter, filled with trepidation, opened his grade report. His worst fears had been confirmed; he had failed his exam. The world around him seemed to freeze, the words blurring before his tear-filled eyes. He felt a lump in his throat, threatening to break him down.

When he arrived home, his heart felt heavy in his chest. A flood of despair washed over him as he trudged into the house. His father, sitting in his usual chair by the fireplace, looked up. Walter managed to meet his father's eyes and admitted, ""I failed, dad.""

His father looked at him, a hint of sadness in his eyes, yet an undeniable understanding. He patted the empty space beside him, indicating Walter to sit down. His father then slowly said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk.""

Walter looked at his father, surprised by his response. His father, noticing his bewilderment, elaborated, ""You can't change what's already happened, Walter. You can only learn from it and move on.""

Something in Walter lightened. He didn't feel as burdened anymore. Though his failure stung, he realized that his father was right. This setback was not the end; it was only a stepping stone towards success. He would not let this failure define him; instead, he decided to let it be his motivation.","255,99,85,286,7,321,325,304,191,57,335,22,59,128,135,131,32,295,205,212,49,173,150,141,86,153,156,180,155,123,194,188,181,296,2,264,282,130,97,261,185,272,10,26,78,224,127,218,336,179,165,268,81,241,198,40,337,116,221,161,47,157,190,13,148,52,281,147,132,270,17,122,257,313,125,104,209,106,263,133,117,240,14,311,226,61,334,120,302,152,227,143,73,242,15,203,235,193,111,204,308,44,316,200,259,312,23,163,254,63,169,315,300,19,93,103,274,76,233,142,164,288,217,328,28,29,250,265,34,50,170,168,283,172,251,113,110,3,322,303,260,225,121,134,278,33,323,232,330,287,149,215,5,68,137,293,317,70,138,184,72,329,96,213,236,292,279,234,222,258,189,269,45,162,318,158,140,266,273,112,92,102,201,310,108,98,94,174,136,253,327,245,223,160,37,298,159,276,80,220","29,27,62,176,197,194,60,174,108,121,51","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
155,There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.,"John looked at himself in the mirror, a look of frustration etched across his face. He had just walked out of an important interview and, to put it mildly, he felt it could have gone better. The interview was for a position at a prestigious law firm he had been dreaming of joining ever since he graduated law school. His hands balled up into fists, his mind replaying every misstep he had made.

Should he have worn a more conservative tie? Had he laughed too loudly at the interviewer's dry joke? Had he given too much detail when asked about his previous job? These thoughts circled around his mind, forcing him to relive every awkward moment.

Staring into the mirror, John kept analyzing his performance, every line of his face revealing a new worry. He questioned whether he had come across as too confident, or perhaps not confident enough. The way he had stumbled over the question about his long-term career goals, had that been a deal breaker? 

His mind went over the list of questions again, dissecting every response he had given, punishing himself for not being more prepared. He had known this interview was critical. Now, all he could do was pick apart his performance, wallowing in self-pity and regret.

John slumped onto his bed, rubbing his temples. His once neatly combed hair was now a ruffled mess. He felt his energy drain away as he went over the questions and his responses once again. He couldn't escape the feeling that he had blown it. This opportunity, he was sure, had slipped through his fingers.

Suddenly, a knock sounded on his door. It was his flatmate, Alan. Alan was also a lawyer and knew all too well the stress of job interviews. He walked into the room, his eyes quickly scanning John's dejected form. 

""Bad interview, huh?"" Alan asked, a sympathetic smile on his face. John nodded, the regret still etched in his face. Alan sat next to him on the bed, patting his back gently. 

""I've been there, buddy,"" Alan sympathized, ""I know it's tough. But you know what? There's no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. It's done. You can't change anything about it.""

John looked at Alan, his eyebrows raised in question. 

""Move on to the next one,"" Alan said, his voice steady and soothing. ""Take whatever lessons you can from this interview, and apply it to the next one. We learn from our mistakes, John. It's how we grow.""

John sighed, a small nod of agreement. He was right. It wasn't the end of the world. And maybe, just maybe, he was being too hard on himself. There would be more interviews, more opportunities. With that thought in mind, John began to let go of his regret and instead focused on what was to come. It was time to move forward.","330,29,217,302,2,176,230,294,153,158,174,147,189,260,225,182,4,117,267,160,214,316,167,44,236,20,107,241,41,22,81,101,124,283,21,318,100,282,310,201,148,173,289,304,186,94,185,293,27,151,116,161,95,232,102,159,5,30,12,114,197,248,262,72,66,280,61,243,305,240,156,245,288,9,16,8,253,83,154,112,17,337,126,128,295,60,19,64,177,195,180,162,303,7,313,191,23,268,271,300,15,172,67,263,111,78,59,163,96,281,193,145,58,165,79,73,207,311,314,212,235,211,278,10,287,143,256,312,6,93,200,70,269,13,164,120,113,259,216,296,62,26,208,198,51,254,136,140,118,103,63,18,132,46,183,115,157,308,234,139,204,202,320,257,192,272,35,84,131,90,98,292,315,110,265,244,54,252,49,99,227,144,85,50,53,206,36,105,219,334,55,31,71,220,199,321,40,135,325,33","79,71,157,10,56,20,52,92,108,135,114","1, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120"
156,"Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.","Larry couldn't get Samantha out of his head, even though months had passed since their painful breakup. He would find himself lost in thoughts of her as he drove to work, and her haunting memories would creep into his dreams at night. Samantha, with her lively laughter and sparkling green eyes, was everywhere in Larry's world. His heart ached every time he remembered her, the love they shared, and the promises they made to each other.

Mary, his older sister, watched this heart-wrenching journey of her younger brother. She witnessed him carrying this baggage every day, silently suffering, trapped in the heartbreak. Larry was not like his usual cheerful self. His eyes, which used to gleam with vivacity, were now shadowed with melancholy. The sight of his pain was unbearable for her.

Finally, one day, Mary decided to talk to Larry. He was sitting on their porch, staring into the distance, lost in his world. She sat next to him, putting her arm around him, she said, ""Larry, you have to let her go.""

Larry remained silent, staring blankly into the night. He had heard these words from many but coming from Mary; they felt different. He sighed, a slow painful sigh, and asked, ""How do you let go of someone you love?""

Mary took a deep breath and replied, ""Time heals, Larry. But only if you allow it to. Dwelling over Samantha won't change anything. She has moved on, and it's high time you do too.""

Larry sat quietly for a moment, absorbing her words. It was a harsh truth that he knew but was running away from accepting. Samantha had indeed moved on; she had started a new life, while he was stuck in a memory.

""Healing doesn't mean the damage never existed. It means the damage no longer controls our lives,"" Mary said, quoting a famous saying. Larry nodded, tears welled up in his eyes, but he managed a weak smile. That night, he went to bed with a determination to move forward.

It was a long road ahead, filled with bumps and challenges. But with time and support from his sister, Larry began to heal. His heartache lessened as he focused on himself, picking up the hobbies he left behind and reconnecting with his old friends. Months later, Samantha became a part of Larry's past, a chapter he learned from, not a painful memory that controlled his life.","25,178,243,103,336,303,92,127,338,154,8,236,120,22,320,170,278,315,84,132,223,313,202,334,186,151,175,276,21,107,302,66,169,85,162,307,253,145,172,13,335,240,48,166,325,289,157,165,332,221,147,288,104,105,80,235,36,199,268,45,295,210,317,281,304,28,163,227,314,308,284,76,306,134,322,228,215,11,183,310,89,59,274,62,52,195,330,261,49,216,269,316,270,190,292,53,149,16,57,119,95,233,70,245,296,224,208,141,124,17,33,272,23,264,144,74,32,171,161,214,135,293,231,142,2,271,125,126,130,298,321,39,184,64,207,87,176,318,249,218,333,160,110,5,311,196,168,26,164,260,113,40,139,331,131,327,159,158,47,37,148,204,9,242,174,99,152,97,121,200,300,187,15,239,29,155,252,201,262,136,114,67,250,323,108,153,86,254,244,143,79,257,211,282,54,248,319,203,290,6","10,176,47,158,157,142,119,35,67,149,48","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
157,"When Juli's favorite tree had fallen over, her father created a painting of it and said there was nothing else they could do.","Juli had grown up in the small countryside town of Hopewell, a place where houses dotted the landscape amidst a sea of lush greenery. The backyard of her little white house was her haven. At the center of it was her favorite tree, a large imposing oak, which had always stood tall and proud, its expansive canopy like an umbrella providing shade on sweltering summer afternoons. It wasn't just a tree to Juli, but a steadfast companion, a refuge, a friend. 

Every year, she would look forward to the days when it would burst into a blaze of oranges and reds, indicating the arrival of the Fall. With age, Juli had formed a strong bond with the tree, an emotional attachment that transcended the ordinary. However, all good things must come to an end, they say. 

One stormy day, the oak tree that had been standing tall for centuries, had fallen over. Juli was devastated. She felt as if she had lost a part of herself. She had cried for days, refusing to eat or drink. The sight of the empty yard brought tears to her eyes and a lump in her throat.

Seeing his daughter's distress, Juli's father, a renowned local painter, decided to do something about it. He spent days out in the yard, working on a canvas, keeping his work secret. All he told Juli was that he was working on a surprise. It piqued her interest but did nothing to alleviate her sorrow.

Days turned into weeks, and finally, it was done. Underneath a clear blue sky, her father revealed his masterpiece. It was a life-like painting of the oak tree in its full glory, capturing every minute detail. From the gnarled bark to the individual leaves fluttering in the wind, the painting was a perfect representation of her beloved tree. 

Juli was stunned into silence. She walked closer, her fingers tracing the paint strokes that mirrored her old friend. Her heart was heavy with longing, but also filled with gratitude towards her father. 

Her father gently placed his arm around her and said, ""I know how much you loved the tree, sweetheart. And I'm sorry that we couldn't save it. But I hope this painting will always remind you of your friend, of the memories you shared. Remember, it's not the physical object that we lose, but the memories remain. And sometimes, there's nothing else we can do but to cherish those memories."" 

Juli looked up at her father, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. She nodded, understanding the profoundness in her father's words. The pain of loss was still there, but somehow, it had become more bearable. With her father by her side and the painting as a reminder of her favorite tree, Juli realized that although life changes and things may come to an end, the memories they leave behind are timeless and precious.","165,167,18,63,325,94,124,85,16,171,231,13,335,24,232,237,135,223,185,274,103,323,73,76,140,309,26,79,141,253,285,168,0,97,139,44,216,319,235,331,289,256,244,67,318,164,154,70,43,260,129,293,249,148,288,90,211,142,262,181,228,269,208,175,267,19,53,177,143,301,305,217,107,332,25,186,316,264,162,72,337,310,169,183,191,95,153,10,68,298,14,99,23,106,149,336,202,188,110,195,250,282,258,254,322,304,159,56,156,230,241,330,278,2,150,312,65,334,329,74,115,273,138,255,12,265,96,234,196,246,283,302,54,290,146,114,1,83,242,199,163,112,184,32,247,116,166,158,161,30,272,294,105,111,200,279,137,28,45,71,155,212,243,248,117,88,299,204,170,59,198,176,64,134,113,214,218,222,127,194,275,136,126,52,80,160,295,315,259,205,308,11,92,20,300,118,125,276,31,104","47,161,109,148,107,186,149,79,141,46,1","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
158,"After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.","Tim was known throughout his high school for his passion for basketball. Every year since freshman year, he had always tried out for the school's basketball team. The school gymnasium would vibrate with the sound of sneakers squeaking against the polished wooden floor and the resounding echo of the ball bouncing rhythmically against the walls. Tim always waited for this time of the year with unreserved anticipation. However, every year ended in disappointment. Tim had not once been successful in his attempts to make the team.

Barry, Tim's best friend since kindergarten, always attended the basketball tryouts. He admired Tim's determination and skill, often calling him a real ""basketball artist"". But this time around, he could see the sadness etched on Tim's face after his name was once again not called out for the final team selection.

Tim's shoulders slumped and his spirit visibly deflated. ""I guess basketball isn't for me,"" Tim admitted defeatedly, a single tear trickling down his cheek. It was a bitter pill to swallow for someone who had made basketball his life.

Barry, having seen this heart-wrenching scene, was moved by his friend's disappointment. He knew just how much making the team meant to Tim. Not wanting his friend to give up on his dream, Barry decided to have a conversation with Tim.

""Hey, Tim,"" he said, putting a comforting hand on Tim's shoulder, ""I know you're disappointed. But remember, the journey to success is filled with ups and downs.""

Tim looked at Barry with a hopeless expression, unable to comprehend his words in the midst of his sadness. But Barry continued, ""I saw you out there, man. You've got talent. You just need a little more work, a little more practice.""

His voice softened, ""You have to stray away from your emotions, Tim. I know it's hard, but these disappointments can't define you.""

""Keep in mind that not making the team this year doesn't mean you'll never make it,"" he added wisely. ""All the greats faced obstacles. Look at Michael Jordan; he didn't make his high school team at first. But he worked hard, real hard. And look where it got him.""

Barry looked directly into Tim's eyes, his gaze intense. ""So you gotta promise me, Tim,"" he implored, ""that you'll work hard. Not just for me, or for the team, but for yourself.""

Tim, who had been silently listening to his friend, finally spoke. ""I... I'll try, Barry."" Although still upset, there was a spark of hope in his eyes - a spark that hadn't been there before.

Nodding in approval, Barry patted Tim's back, his faith unshaken. He knew that this wasn't the end for his friend, but the beginning of a long, challenging, yet rewarding journey. After all, basketball wasn't just a game for Tim, it was his dream. And dreams, Barry believed, were worth fighting for.","240,259,75,33,51,143,46,305,124,257,183,200,254,315,84,237,36,329,319,268,153,62,37,43,126,214,108,323,281,165,172,155,13,238,208,115,110,52,224,15,198,313,290,287,180,228,263,307,173,5,140,6,80,154,337,312,32,297,123,247,24,251,207,35,260,3,0,156,262,114,54,83,41,339,130,330,70,285,90,61,272,150,196,88,266,294,276,204,27,197,125,53,286,203,279,245,94,47,199,304,26,189,96,78,99,77,20,137,333,236,326,38,10,69,40,147,42,166,79,192,14,151,318,65,229,157,16,233,71,331,93,205,56,152,21,146,314,98,239,162,269,72,92,74,163,169,335,235,164,182,159,22,145,298,310,246,194,302,118,334,95,136,44,181,168,242,91,222,170,336,190,291,193,57,25,177,284,178,11,299,275,29,249,171,244,248,227,132,160,206,161,39,293,7,63,100,234,89,101,85","54,32,68,126,151,189,191,140,145,149,30","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
159,"We missed the bus, but it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk.","It was a clear, sunny afternoon as my sister, Laura, and I packed our bags and stepped out of the house. We had planned to take the 4 o'clock bus to visit our grandmother in the next town over. The air was filled with anticipation as it always was when a visit to grandma was on the horizon. Her house was full of warmth and love, and her cookies were legendary. 

As we rounded the corner, we noticed the time - it was 3:55 pm. We quickened our pace, the anticipation morphing into anxiety. When we finally reached the bus stop, our hearts sank. The bus had already gone, and the next one wasn't until 6 o'clock. The digital display board at the bus stop only confirmed our worst fears. We had missed the bus. 

Laura's face clouded over with disappointment and she threw her bag on the ground in frustration. I could see her gearing up for an angry tirade. ""Why didn't you wake me up earlier? Why didn't we leave the house sooner?"" she fumed. 

I understood her frustration, I felt it too, but I knew there was nothing to be gained by venting our anger. If anything, it would only sour our mood further. So, I gently reached out and touched her arm to calm her down. ""It serves no use to be angry about it right now, Laura,"" I told her soothingly.

Laura looked at me, her eyes still full of storm, but I could see them softening a little. Her shoulders slumped, and she grudgingly picked up her bag. 

""Let's walk,"" I proposed, and she grudgingly agreed. 

We decided to turn our missed bus into an adventure and walked through the beautifully flowered countryside, something we wouldn't have been able to enjoy had we taken the bus. We passed by quaint little houses, fields ripe with crops swaying gently in the breeze, and the town's old bakery that reminded us of grandma's cookies. 

As we neared grandma's house, our spirits were lifted once more. The missed bus had turned into a forgotten memory. The anger was replaced by the joy of our impromptu walk, and the realization that sometimes, missing the bus isn't such a bad thing after all. 

After that day, whenever we missed the bus, we would look at each other and smile, remembering our adventure. And then, instead of being angry, we would start walking, enjoying the journey as much as the destination.","13,23,223,44,88,291,294,95,56,265,69,163,190,283,220,292,209,334,219,58,143,3,203,8,241,297,170,312,146,75,110,76,200,329,46,202,193,49,112,197,164,315,272,266,314,331,157,229,22,328,246,26,85,247,134,74,277,77,29,228,183,248,289,321,109,242,47,117,64,215,338,179,288,276,98,106,65,162,148,307,269,19,81,244,68,150,189,97,327,320,199,278,308,233,129,155,121,156,115,214,120,165,274,270,128,324,16,89,126,90,87,167,149,24,2,306,305,9,194,298,225,166,173,27,160,174,154,240,152,158,182,216,284,80,119,239,105,20,39,185,210,72,113,302,15,132,300,319,45,82,335,175,54,38,325,257,280,52,268,293,91,111,136,260,282,290,86,251,295,178,6,125,168,337,147,42,224,55,101,102,67,35,66,195,177,124,281,161,171,188,4,323,99,142,255,234,62,339,208,169","127,96,98,47,130,125,188,78,12,41,102","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
160,"Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.","For years, Claire and Emily had not spoken to each other. Despite having shared a wonderful childhood together, the teenage years saw the birth of misunderstandings and eventual estrangement. Rumors, resentments, and rivalries had formed a daunting wall between them, turning the best of friends into strangers. They had lost themselves in the maze of adulthood, their paths seemingly diverging further each passing year.

Suddenly, life presented them with a peculiar twist. They found themselves working together in the same department, in the same company. At first, the office environment was frosty, characterized by mere professional courtesy and casual small talk. They avoided each other's gaze, fearful of what the other might say or do. Yet, fate appeared to have a different plan for them.

One day, Claire found Emily crying silently in the breakroom. Moved by a sense of old kinship, she sat down beside her and offered her a sympathetic ear. In the privacy of the dimly lit room, Emily bared her heart, letting Claire into her world of personal troubles and professional struggles. Surprised by Emily's vulnerability, Claire reciprocated, sharing her challenges too. Through these conversations, their ice of resentment started to melt, revealing the layer of lost friendship beneath it.

Their discussions became regular, often extending beyond work hours. They discovered they still had much in common; they shared laughter, favorite movies, books, and even taste in food. Eventually, they started spending time together outside work too, rekindling their childhood camaraderie. Their conversations transformed from professional and cordial to personal and deep.

One quiet evening, after a long day at work, they were sitting in their favorite coffee shop. With warm cups of coffee cradled in their hands, they fell into a comfortable silence. Claire broke the silence first, uttering the words they both felt in their hearts, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

Emily looked at Claire, smiling warmly. Nodding in agreement, she felt a weight lifted from her heart. The wall that had been built with years of misunderstanding and resentment had been demolished, replaced by the bridge of renewed friendship. Their past, no matter how bitter, was behind them. Their bond, strained by time and circumstance, had mended itself, stronger than ever before.

So, now that they were friends again, they decided to let bygones be bygones. They chose to leave their past behind, focusing on the present and the bond they shared. It was a new beginning, not just as colleagues but as friends who had rediscovered the beauty of their long-lost friendship.","292,256,262,23,71,237,235,205,211,220,149,80,143,165,42,159,52,309,242,336,280,125,33,156,47,120,123,36,28,297,259,131,5,274,93,176,272,72,0,127,285,207,48,153,268,201,43,154,302,37,212,239,32,223,31,316,304,133,83,271,88,110,279,251,325,155,266,286,249,111,282,204,327,289,140,22,232,55,137,105,317,102,7,112,4,158,11,236,34,182,319,77,58,313,50,228,117,173,174,265,326,296,16,227,19,337,258,136,135,164,322,329,61,157,148,97,73,104,222,226,1,323,41,191,233,215,103,175,99,106,287,113,234,312,124,145,168,273,184,90,91,170,321,189,315,224,255,253,67,98,82,21,314,332,27,167,218,100,210,87,162,151,63,214,66,161,40,334,199,39,294,257,283,169,181,12,128,9,305,78,244,291,51,278,150,179,24,267,252,247,172,86,138,203,57,68,163,270,331,192","48,66,24,114,86,16,166,161,197,110,14","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
161,"Since both of our favourite teams have lost, lets enjoy the world cup together and not fight.","Jess and Mike have always been passionate about football. Ever since they were children, they supported their teams with unwavering loyalty. Jess was a die-hard fan of Argentina, while Mike wore the colors of Germany with immense pride. Their favourite teams' rivalry didn't change their bond; they managed to keep their friendship intact through every World Cup tournament.

As kids, they would set up mini football goals in their shared backyard, using sticks as goal posts, while recreating their favourite World Cup moments. Whenever the World Cup would come around, it was a tradition for them to huddle up in one of their living rooms and watch every single match with anticipation.

However, the 2022 World Cup was different. The rivalry between their favourite teams was intense. Germany and Argentina were tipped as favourites to win the tournament. They watched with bated breath as both teams played remarkably well throughout the tournament, giving each other a good fight.

In the semi-finals, both Germany and Argentina were at a tie. It was a nerve-wracking match for both Jess and Mike. Eventually, it came down to penalty shootouts. Surprisingly, both teams missed their penalties, resulting in heartbreaking losses.

Suddenly, both their favourite teams were out of the World Cup. Jess and Mike were stunned and heartbroken. Their dreams of watching their teams lift the cup vanished. They were at a loss for words, but amidst the disappointment, they realised something important.

They looked at each other and Mike, in a solemn voice said, ""Since both of our favourite teams have lost, let's enjoy the World Cup together and not fight."" His words made sense. What was the point of rooting against each other when the source of their rivalry was no longer in the picture?

Taking a moment to let his words sink in, Jess finally nodded, “Yes, let's support the love of the game rather than individual teams."" They decided to put their rivalry aside and watch the rest of the tournament together, cherishing the remarkable moments football has to offer.

Together, they celebrated the spectacular goals, enjoyed the brilliant saves and admired the sportsmanship shown by the remaining teams. They realized that their love for the game was stronger than their allegiance to any team. They promised each other that from then on, they'd cheer for the beautiful game itself rather than letting team rivalries come between their friendship.

This World Cup taught Jess and Mike a valuable lesson. While they still supported their teams, they learned to appreciate football as a whole. And though their favourite teams had lost, they found that their shared love for football had ultimately won.","275,160,291,247,322,328,159,311,323,223,129,83,163,334,236,18,102,37,12,292,202,153,222,77,70,7,194,144,265,148,316,177,169,150,1,10,135,294,61,20,53,39,151,327,60,146,184,295,122,26,52,67,155,272,24,318,58,256,300,127,288,46,117,174,269,99,224,330,76,28,100,221,121,198,203,186,134,154,123,156,142,97,139,59,128,93,45,113,5,56,280,103,42,176,227,133,308,132,87,314,253,206,181,200,89,304,315,312,124,94,237,168,326,106,157,111,246,47,232,74,298,261,101,309,257,167,4,283,50,196,251,138,82,183,204,116,208,201,140,271,258,228,158,303,286,329,339,187,40,282,16,259,31,9,212,73,217,193,78,115,54,214,338,243,119,17,245,166,120,0,62,162,287,260,333,11,211,65,175,165,279,105,30,254,299,197,226,6,136,118,331,164,189,114,15,270,302,207,90,23","78,53,80,115,143,7,2,172,13,192,180","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
162,Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.,"Laura and Matt had been working together for years. They had always been excellent teammates, creating fantastic ideas that brought impressive profits to their company. Their synergy was enviable, and their creative minds were unmatched. But just like every partnership, they had their lows.

It was an ordinary Tuesday when their conflict emerged. A key project was assigned to their team, which was crucial for their company's future. They started off enthusiastically, brainstorming and suggesting potential concepts. But suddenly, a disagreement surfaced. Matt disagreed with Laura's approach towards the project, while Laura remained confident about her perspective.

""It doesn't make any sense, Laura! You're taking us down the wrong path,"" Matt exclaimed in frustration. 

""I believe in this strategy, Matt, I know it will work,"" Laura responded, defending her stance.

The rift between them deepened. Their arguments heated, affecting their work atmosphere and consequently, their productivity. A week passed, and their discord was evident to everyone around them. They hardly spoke to each other, and when they did, it was only about work.

Meanwhile, the project was stagnating. Deadlines were approaching rapidly. The higher-ups were getting nervous. Their dream team was falling apart. Something had to change.

One late afternoon, after yet another silent and unproductive day, Matt decided to break the ice. He walked into Laura's office and sat down, deciding that their personal differences shouldn't jeopardize the company's future.

""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together,"" Matt suggested, trying to rebuild their shattered partnership.

Laura looked at him, surprised but relieved. ""I agree, Matt,"" she replied. ""Our personal feud shouldn't affect our professional responsibilities.""

They both smiled, acknowledging their mistakes. From then onwards, they decided to start afresh. They made it a point to communicate more effectively and not let their differences interfere with their work. 

In no time, their productivity soared again. They shared and exchanged ideas, respecting each other's perspectives. They managed to bring the stagnant project back to life, presenting a fantastic strategy that impressed their superiors. 

Their journey wasn't smooth, but they learned a valuable lesson about teamwork and respect. They understood that disagreements were natural, but it's crucial to address them positively. Their experience reinforced the importance of collaboration and communication in every project they undertook.","174,147,153,98,262,177,249,79,95,261,215,130,250,309,39,89,124,34,222,109,164,60,203,127,17,191,175,80,145,83,0,46,78,36,239,297,217,285,218,116,76,62,48,228,324,220,186,9,156,226,336,260,168,101,206,2,160,172,35,136,125,187,227,74,330,195,292,53,128,243,47,259,230,254,165,8,33,30,207,273,121,314,99,146,329,281,148,50,51,235,44,158,159,296,140,335,115,238,21,288,276,269,196,268,316,181,154,122,104,264,312,212,71,293,114,81,144,87,42,282,82,18,246,27,278,192,233,10,157,7,214,307,52,139,301,310,252,251,229,142,138,245,173,270,204,202,318,129,45,271,151,149,267,117,25,73,150,137,94,92,323,183,40,13,37,75,178,237,304,163,255,265,90,311,200,193,201,180,161,5,100,313,197,332,198,119,283,287,155,333,61,205,179,59,241,103,20,102,199,291","107,189,49,129,92,93,57,179,170,21,75","1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
163,The brother and sister decided to stop the fight and decided to be cordial again.,"Once upon a time, in a quiet suburb, two siblings named Ryan and Emily lived together in perfect harmony. They were both close in age and inseparable, making memories and sharing laughter. However, over time, tensions grew between them over trivial matters. The once peaceful house turned into a battleground of disagreements, name-calling, and stubborn clashes.

Their quarrels escalated over the years, slowly creating a wall of bitterness between the once inseparable siblings. Ryan and Emily's constant bickering made the house filled with hostility, an unbearable living environment for them and their parents. One day, the situation spiraled out of control, leading to a colossal fight over a minor misunderstanding.

It all started when Ryan blamed Emily for taking his favorite pen, accusing her without any proof. Emily, in turn, furiously accused Ryan of misplacing it as he did with his other belongings. The argument grew into a big quarrel, creating a negative aura that enveloped the entire house. Hurtful words were exchanged, eyes welled up with tears, and neither of them was ready to back down.

Their fight was so loud that it caught their parents' attention. The parents, completely taken aback, could do nothing but watch their once loving children fight over something so trivial. Disappointed and concerned, they decided to let Ryan and Emily resolve their issues on their own. However, the siblings continued their fight, each blaming the other, ignoring their distressed parents.

Later that night, as they lay in their separate rooms, each replayed the day's events. A bitter taste of regret filled their hearts. Their fight, which started over a mere pen, seemed so trivial now. Both began to miss their old companionship, their shared laughter, and the bond they once cherished.

The brother and sister, realizing the mistake they had made, decided to reconcile. They recognized that their foolish fight over a pen was not worth the cost of their relationship. They understood that disagreements were normal between siblings, but the way they had handled it was not healthy or acceptable.

The following morning, they decided to break the ice and approach each other. After a long, heartfelt conversation, apologies were exchanged, and forgiveness was granted. The brother and sister decided to stop the fight and chose to be cordial again. They agreed to handle disagreements maturely in the future, promising not to let such trivial matters drive a wedge between them again.

From then on, Ryan and Emily put in efforts to rebuild the bond they once shared. Their decision to restore peace between them not only cleared the negative energy in their house but also brought a sense of relief to their worried parents. That's how the brother and sister learned the importance of communication, forgiveness, and the irreplaceable value of their bond. They learned to cherish each other more and ensured that their relationship remained harmonious, creating an atmosphere of love and understanding in their home.","207,13,26,16,150,54,149,9,257,108,30,79,60,192,188,272,168,208,277,292,193,334,140,211,147,143,53,196,155,205,70,166,237,317,202,95,298,273,112,114,145,38,266,5,21,181,253,104,191,15,101,169,67,18,165,89,297,94,61,175,215,209,314,244,226,308,302,335,121,296,81,69,160,259,281,55,213,241,180,311,251,229,321,103,156,59,1,223,119,187,288,102,301,218,91,40,153,122,80,134,294,203,27,71,233,179,75,111,284,22,201,130,96,139,62,4,25,116,20,110,148,239,162,158,240,161,65,34,44,8,83,144,263,338,324,172,242,248,328,231,142,82,154,131,159,300,214,316,11,0,336,306,293,315,73,24,97,236,135,330,35,43,100,295,84,151,124,157,85,267,289,123,3,303,17,77,63,216,337,164,2,282,52,264,120,286,285,279,304,93,64,78,234,118,309,256,291,32,6,200","143,29,85,168,124,145,73,126,123,180,55","Here are the top 10 most analogous stories from the sentence bank for the given target story:

164,The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other.,"After years of devastating conflict, the war was finally over. The dust of battle began to settle on the bloody fields, the sound of artillery and gunfire was replaced by a solemn silence. Countries that were once bitter enemies now stared at each other across negotiation tables, bearing the weight of untold losses and shattered hopes.

The decision had been unanimous: They had to maintain friendly relations with each other. The harsh lessons of war had taught them that the path of aggression led to nothing but despair and ruin. They resolved to write a new chapter of unity, reconciliation, and peace.

At the initial meeting, representatives from every country gathered. Every leader, once poised for war, now entered the assembly with a common purpose. The atmosphere was tense, yet filled with an unspoken hope that had been absent for years.

The first day was filled with difficult, yet necessary discussions. Each nation's leader expressed their grievances, their regrets, and their hopes for the future. It was a day of emotional revelations, but through the tears and anger, an outline of peace began to emerge.

Among them were nations that had been at the frontline of the war, bearing the brunt of the devastation. There were heart-wrenching testimonies of battles fought, loved ones lost, cities razed. Even so, they too pledged to maintain cordial ties with their erstwhile enemies. Their commitment to peace was not a sign of weakness, but a testament to their strength and resilience.

As the days turned into weeks, they forged agreements and signed treaties. The ink on the papers symbolized their collective vow to foster peace, unity, and respect among nations. Economic partnerships were formed, cultural exchanges were planned, joint scientific endeavors were initiated. A roadmap to a peaceful future was taking shape.

Over time, these efforts bore fruit. Trade flourished between nations, cultural barriers slowly came down, and people started traveling freely across borders. For the first time in years, laughter replaced the tears, and optimism replaced fear. The world witnessed the dawn of a new era.

The sacrifices of war were not forgotten. Every country erected monuments honoring the fallen, ensuring that their bravery and sacrifice would continue to inspire future generations. These monuments also served as a stark reminder of the cost of war and the preciousness of peace.

Finally, the once war-torn nations were blooming again. Cities were rebuilt, economies were recovering, and people were beginning to live normal lives. The scars of war still remained, but they were healing, slowly but surely.

The war was over, and the countries had decided to maintain friendly relations with each other. It was a bold step, a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity. From the ashes of war, they had chosen to rise again, united and resolute, turning their backs to conflict and their faces towards a future of shared peace and prosperity.","20,66,230,336,99,236,266,307,106,291,175,74,86,161,178,337,328,223,88,261,271,89,264,285,57,158,317,41,203,275,320,257,19,38,169,10,155,330,198,33,190,300,216,53,138,0,58,282,171,250,71,76,226,62,181,90,127,179,103,270,4,156,318,288,278,162,220,322,112,3,256,135,87,139,35,339,157,98,302,304,218,247,17,263,37,81,212,45,24,249,140,225,184,110,18,297,208,123,160,283,301,205,312,83,56,269,238,130,177,25,224,27,84,191,213,252,91,284,95,43,165,128,313,294,115,154,145,199,144,253,200,131,192,168,124,12,338,276,142,125,327,42,72,227,105,75,137,240,55,314,163,170,67,228,242,31,221,277,143,159,292,311,80,48,151,265,324,295,96,2,73,319,217,152,64,8,174,232,193,188,150,147,5,196,244,323,274,210,267,215,60,114,69,102,121,172,78,100,233,243","126,37,62,77,26,160,99,14,66,151,121","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149"
165,The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.,"Once upon a time, in the suburbs of Colorado Springs, lived a couple named Elizabeth and James. They had always been the iconic representation of what true love looked like. However, a series of unfortunate events led to a noticeable fracture in their once blissful marriage.

Their communication became less frequent, the smiles became less bright, and the love between them appeared to be gradually dwindling. Elizabeth started feeling unfulfilled, while James felt overwhelmed with work stress. Their beautiful home was turning into a battlefield of silent wars and late-night arguments. Finally, they reached a point where they felt there was no other option but to go through with a divorce.

Both of them were heartbroken but were convinced it was the best decision for each other's happiness. They hired a lawyer and began to split their assets. Their children, Jane and Matthew, were heartbroken. Their house echoed with sadness as the divorce proceedings carried on.

In the midst of the melancholy, an unexpected turn of events took place. One evening, while they were going through their photo albums, they stumbled upon pictures of their past. The pictures were filled with joyous memories of laughter, carefree dance, vacations, and family gatherings. They began reminiscing about their journey together, which ignited a spark of hope.

Overwhelmed by nostalgia, Elizabeth broke down, expressing her inner feelings of fear, abandonment, and regrets. James, touched by her vulnerability, embraced her. They ended up spending the entire night sharing memories, openly communicating, and forgiving each other for their past mistakes.

The energy in their home began to shift as they talked and laughed like they used to. The idea of divorce suddenly seemed foreign to them, as if it was an unwelcome guest in their marriage. They decided to withdraw the divorce proceedings and sought professional help to heal their relationship.

They attended marriage counselling sessions, relearned how to communicate effectively, understood each other's needs, and revived the love that seemed to have been lost. Their children, Jane and Matthew, were overjoyed to see their parents making efforts to mend their relationship.

I had seen many expressions throughout my long career in human resources, yet your face stood out. It was lit up like a Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, warm and inviting.

""I can see that you are beside yourself with joy at being selected for the job, congratulations,"" I said, extending my hand towards you. The way your eyes sparkled in that moment, it was as if you had won the lottery. You accepted my gesture and shook my hand heartily, barely suppressing your glee.

You thanked me profusely, the words tumbling out of you as if the dam holding them back had finally broken. Your excitement was contagious, making me smile too, despite my usually stoic demeanor. It was at that moment that I knew we had made the right choice.

You had been through multiple rounds of interviews, competing with many other applicants. Despite the tough competition, your perseverance, hard work, and dedication had paid off. The journey had been long and grueling, but today, all of that was forgotten in your victory.

After our handshake, you let out a breath of relief. The joy you felt was not just for yourself, but also for your family. You had mentioned in your interviews about the sacrifices your parents had made for your education. Now, their efforts had borne fruit.

Overwhelmed, you talked about how this job would help you to finally afford a place of your own. You spoke about your dreams for the future and the joy of finally being able to achieve them. This wasn't just a job for you; it was a stepping-stone towards your dreams.

I remember you telling me about your mentor at university, the one who had encouraged you to apply for this job. She had seen something special in you and believed in your potential. Today, you had proved her right. Your joy wasn't just for the position, but also for the validation and the opportunity.

As you left my office, the spark in your eyes and the skip in your step showed your excitement. It was as if you were on cloud nine. I couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment at that moment. 

Indeed, seeing your joy reminded me of the true essence of my job - not just to fill positions, but to change lives. Watching you, the newly selected applicant, I remembered why I chose this profession in the first place.

I smiled again, this time at the thought of your future contributions to our company.

167,Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.,"It had been three long years since Rory last saw her brother, Sean. They had shared a tumultuous relationship, filled with childhood fights, sibling rivalry, but also love. Unfortunately, life took them on different paths. Sean moved out, seeking to explore the vast world while Rory decided to stay back, to take care of their aging parents.

Rory had been standing in the hallway when she heard the familiar ring of the landline. She watched her mother rush to pick up the call, an unusual spark in her eyes. As the conversation progressed, she saw her mother's face light up like a Christmas tree, her joy resonating around the otherwise somber room. 

""Rory, it's Sean!"" her mother shouted from across the room, a broad smile spreading across her face. Rory could feel her heart lurch. It had been so long, Sean hadn't bothered to make a call in ages.

Her mother continued to speak animatedly, occasionally laughing and wiping tears from her eyes. The sight warmed Rory's heart, a stark contrast to the constant worry lines that had started to appear on their mother's face. The worry of a mother whose son had been absent for years, living in unknown conditions, was slowly eroding.

As Rory watched her mother, she felt a pang of jealousy. She had been the one who stayed back, fulfilling responsibilities, while Sean got to live his life with freedom. Yet, the mere sound of his voice managed to bring such happiness to their mother. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but Rory shrugged it off; this moment was too precious to taint with negative emotions.

Soon, she was invited to the call by her elated mother. Her heart raced as she picked up the receiver, her brother's voice bringing back a flood of childhood memories. They spoke for a while, catching up on their lives, treading the delicate line between their past issues and the current moment of connection.

After the call ended, their mother clutched the receiver to her chest, sighing with a content smile. It was as if a massive burden had been lifted from her shoulders. Rory couldn't help but share her mother's happiness.

That night, the house seemed a little warmer, a little more like the home they used to know. The rest of the evening was spent recollecting memories of Sean, their mother narrating anecdotes filled with his mischievousness and charm. Rory participated, sharing her stories, her resentment diminishing gradually.

She realized that day, even in absence, Sean was as much a part of the family as she was. The happiness on her mother's face was proof enough of his importance. Rory went to bed that night with a lighter heart, her thoughts circling around a hopeful reunion, a chance to revive their bond and make new memories. After all, her brother had finally called after ages.","76,293,176,298,195,22,223,136,315,280,24,334,55,266,132,142,186,30,255,220,191,212,296,267,62,233,241,209,270,47,300,271,327,105,127,120,292,294,163,26,65,308,189,330,118,135,43,297,230,178,314,245,214,184,307,187,54,320,58,154,172,134,250,166,15,101,146,64,179,285,141,52,289,113,199,175,310,10,3,91,169,174,45,194,227,173,148,303,39,53,95,40,275,339,107,112,287,152,235,119,295,104,272,138,182,238,1,147,68,321,171,162,319,338,213,2,9,164,246,249,109,309,278,21,170,108,83,50,193,177,156,322,247,149,325,225,304,4,28,197,337,20,259,237,276,122,234,232,202,311,239,333,102,229,155,140,25,14,262,331,144,306,256,158,80,100,279,265,71,251,228,211,283,326,217,329,16,151,302,207,168,90,18,286,203,61,88,131,129,11,66,60,143,290,204,70,159,258,46,206","64,181,81,125,111","1, 5, 15, 18, 19, 22, 24, 28, 32, 33, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
168,The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.,"Mr. Anderson had always been known as a highly devoted physics teacher. He found immense joy in taking young minds on a thrilling exploration of the universe, from the smallest atomic particles to the vast expanse of galaxies. However, there was one topic that had always posed a significant challenge to him - Quantum Mechanics.

For years, this daunting subject had been a significant stumbling block for his students. Despite Mr. Anderson's varied approach, his students always struggled to grasp the complicated nature of quantum particles and wave functions. The constant failure to explain this to his students was a prickly burr in Mr. Anderson’s side.

Then, on a cold Monday morning, something extraordinary happened. As he woke up, an idea flashed in his mind. He pondered over this new perspective to explain Quantum Mechanics. Excited by this revelation, he rushed into the school.

The students arrived, half expecting another baffling lecture on this complex topic. As Mr. Anderson started, there was an evident change in his demeanor. He seemed more excited, hopeful. He had decided to simplify the quantum world into a metaphor. Quantum particles became dancing party-goers, and the act of observation became the party music affecting their behavior.

He continued his explanation with such exuberance that the classroom was filled with an unfamiliar energy. Even the students who usually seemed disinterested were captivated by his lively performance. Gradually, they began to connect the dots. The abstract concept started making sense in their minds.

At the end of the session, a wave of applause filled the classroom. One of the usually quiet students stood up, expressing how much better she understood the complex topic now. This was it! The breakthrough he had been hoping for!

Suddenly, the daunting subject wasn't so scary anymore. Quantum mechanics, under the magic of Mr. Anderson's animated metaphor, had transformed into a fascinating concept. The students left the classroom with their doubts cleared, ideas kindled, and curiosity aroused for what they had always dreaded.

Mr. Anderson stood alone in the empty classroom, a triumphant smile on his face. He had succeeded, finally. The joy and relief filled his heart, making him ecstatic. His students were now well-equipped to handle the enigma that Quantum Mechanics was once considered.

The feeling of accomplishment swelled in his chest, his heart pounded with satisfaction. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic to his students. This was not only a victory for his students but a testament to his ability to simplify and bring alive even the most complicated subjects.","315,40,52,113,248,279,72,273,25,238,252,151,338,192,210,232,0,15,65,98,219,323,162,310,7,260,217,299,182,122,34,234,105,327,148,4,123,244,303,36,118,30,270,96,243,208,79,56,143,47,134,320,228,280,211,111,298,82,45,69,284,170,55,205,272,3,321,225,209,337,133,175,75,100,141,215,187,184,35,226,171,236,245,167,135,293,76,313,144,18,274,239,331,174,17,107,278,28,218,126,109,149,333,233,246,230,277,5,240,317,163,80,115,43,19,59,286,332,275,301,16,308,325,31,89,285,309,229,124,1,237,339,38,108,120,97,283,177,206,178,142,316,169,189,266,241,297,306,22,9,70,302,10,166,74,95,2,130,42,264,263,197,53,11,26,305,312,207,296,61,128,282,295,288,183,292,147,271,304,116,67,114,267,200,249,235,23,49,90,93,48,227,102,159,146,14,179,335,84,103","154,84,143,62,81","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
169,Samantha was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.,"Samantha sat quietly in her bedroom, scrolling through social media on her phone. Suddenly, her screen lit up with updates from an event - an annual party thrown by mutual friends. An event that she and David, her boyfriend, typically attended together. This year, however, was different. 

Samantha was undergoing chemotherapy. The doctors advised her against attending any crowded events due to her weakened immune system. The annual party would be teeming with friends, laughter, and potential illnesses. So, she had decided to sit this one out.

It was a tough decision, one that weighed heavily on her heart. But Samantha knew her health came first. David had been her rock throughout the ordeal, always by her side and offering much-needed comfort and love. As they sat on their couch a week prior, she had asked David to also refrain from attending the party, a request driven by her fear of feeling left out and lonely.

""Promise me you won't go,"" she had whispered, her voice sounding small in the vast silence of the room. David, holding her hand tightly, had agreed. He knew how important this was to her. His priority was always making sure Samantha felt loved and not left out.

The night of the event arrived. Samantha was feeling a pang of sadness, knowing everyone was probably having a great time without her. She missed the laughter, the shared stories, and the camaraderie.

Then, she came across a photo. David was tagged in a friend's post with a caption stating, ""Miss you at the party!"" Samantha's heart skipped a beat, filled with gratitude. There was no photo of David at the event, but rather, a photo of their friend holding a 'We Miss You, Samantha' placard.

David had indeed kept his promise. He had chosen to stand by her during this rough time, despite the allure of a night filled with friends and celebrations. It was then that Samantha realised that David's love and loyalty were unwavering.

Samantha was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event. A feeling of relief and love washed over her, wiping away the pang of loneliness she had been feeling earlier. 

He had put her needs above everything else, proving his love once again. As she put her phone down, she couldn't wipe the grateful smile off her face. David came into the room just then, the questioning look on his face disappearing as he noticed Samantha's grin. Without a word, he held her close, happy in his choice, validated by her radiant smile. They shared a moment of love and trust, a bond that was only strengthened by their current hardships.","75,120,209,265,15,59,302,90,295,130,46,134,76,305,69,73,220,35,57,222,116,27,205,113,234,37,231,114,70,215,42,150,219,288,246,159,107,103,282,225,77,165,326,232,43,109,36,230,24,168,323,158,80,257,126,93,338,62,151,211,238,213,140,258,199,187,166,278,318,204,124,85,293,248,217,31,308,294,167,88,54,2,45,145,196,97,131,19,254,47,104,269,279,4,317,241,260,255,307,156,122,175,112,226,17,144,298,306,92,195,244,190,71,39,149,198,203,56,189,243,227,223,0,129,170,327,252,171,5,174,206,135,214,20,197,208,66,202,65,63,221,173,8,58,291,176,330,299,6,235,67,267,172,22,201,264,89,297,91,155,55,275,321,105,212,276,139,128,283,111,143,249,334,121,314,333,332,233,79,289,154,324,148,178,138,9,23,329,277,10,286,281,322,153,310,161,274,266,81,68","67,79,50,125,128","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

She laughed lightly, remembering the days when she and Thomas were just kids themselves, oblivious to the rollercoaster that parenthood would later bring.

It was not long ago when little James was timidly stepping into the vast universe of school life, clinging to Susan's hand, his eyes filled with apprehension. Those first few years seemed like the most challenging era, filled with trials, errors, successes, and discoveries. But as he moved forward, he slowly transformed from a shy little boy into an assertive, focused, and promising young man.

Middle school was an unforgettable chapter of James' life. Despite its rollercoaster of emotions, ups and downs, and academic pressures, he thrived, making his parents prouder than ever. His relentless determination, undying zeal, and incessant craving for knowledge were what led him to this momentous day. 

Susan vividly remembered those late-night study sessions where they fought against sleep, trying to absorb the last bits of science and math. She remembered James' first school play where he had confidently delivered his lines, leaving the entire crowd in awe. The fierce soccer matches, the school science fairs, his first crush, his heartbreak, and everything else seemed like a montage of memories that Susan replayed in her mind as Thomas' words echoed.

She expressed to Thomas how James had won the school spelling bee contest and how he had managed to bag the lead role in the school's annual musical. He had made a bunch of amazing friends, discovered his passion for music, and most importantly, learned how to handle failures with grace.

""You wouldn't believe it, Thomas,"" Susan continued, her voice thick with emotion, ""He was awarded the 'Student of the Year' title at his graduation. It was a moment that I'll never forget as long as I live.""

Thomas' voice was full of joy and admiration as he said, ""Your pride is entirely justified, Susan. With such accomplishments, I am sure James is on his way to a promising future. Congratulations to you and James. I am certain he will keep making you proud.""

A lump formed in Susan's throat as she thanked Thomas, the reality of her son's growth setting in. Yes, her little boy was growing up, stepping into a new phase of life. Middle school was over; high school awaited. She felt a combination of anticipation, anxiety, joy, and an overwhelming sense of pride.

Susan ended the call with Thomas, wiping a tear from her eye. She couldn't help but admire the strong, intelligent, and determined young man her son was becoming. As she prepared to embrace the next phase of her son's academic journey, she couldn't help but look back at his middle school graduation with pride and joy.

171,The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.,"Jeremy, the incharge at Townsville Restaurant, was known for his relentless attention to detail and high standards. For weeks, he had been agonizing over the restaurant's lingering cleanliness issue. In particular, the floor of the establishment had been a source of constant concern. Despite countless reminders, the cleaning crew could not seem to get it right, leading to a slippery surface that posed a safety threat to both the staff and customers.

Their inability to adequately perform this task was causing Jeremy immense frustration. He knew he needed to make a change, so he posted a job listing for a new janitorial staff member. It didn’t take long before responses began trickling in. The one that caught his attention was an application from a young woman named Lily, who had previously worked in a renowned hotel chain.

Lily, a fresh-faced young woman, with a twinkle of determination in her eyes, was the first to actually inspire confidence in Jeremy. After going through her references and seeing her past experience, Jeremy decided to hire her. She promised to keep the floor squeaky clean and, importantly, free of any slip hazards.

On Lily's first day, Jeremy handed over all necessary cleaning equipment to her, explaining his expectations. Lily nodded in understanding. Jeremy watched her get to work, noting her meticulous approach to the task. It was a refreshing change to see someone take the role seriously.

The next morning, as Jeremy walked into the restaurant, he could hardly believe his eyes. The restaurant floor, once a grimy, slippery hazard, was now shining like a newly minted coin. He cautiously ran a hand along the surface, it felt thoroughly cleaned and was not slippery. He even dared to walk across it in his polished black work shoes, something he never risked before.

The corners, once the resting place of stubborn grime, were spotless. The smell of freshness permeated the air, making the restaurant feel even more inviting. In all his years of managing the restaurant, he had never seen the floor look so immaculate.

The feeling of satisfaction that enveloped him was immeasurable. Jeremy couldn't contain his joy, he swiftly walked over to Lily, who was busy arranging her cleaning supplies. He saw a sense of pride on her face and knew she had seen the transformation as well.

""You did it, Lily,"" Jeremy said, his voice brimming with genuine admiration and relief. ""This place looks remarkable. No longer do we have a slippery floor but a perfectly clean one!""

The gratitude on Jeremy's face made Lily's day. That was the moment the two of them knew they had achieved more than just a clean floor. They had cultivated an environment of excellence, and this was only the beginning.","196,263,9,112,137,270,67,89,70,218,79,241,100,184,287,74,115,200,90,135,68,178,235,212,338,110,66,51,197,237,21,202,166,95,300,301,163,104,187,96,319,233,91,221,129,158,291,3,228,43,286,254,169,176,216,325,131,205,154,256,13,170,116,144,206,267,27,188,69,242,292,34,2,167,227,92,165,236,231,273,109,285,249,20,298,303,181,73,107,290,60,141,272,150,334,139,238,322,180,71,328,164,157,19,299,24,33,323,168,332,289,35,94,117,177,111,320,261,174,193,278,22,133,277,317,201,179,257,296,203,130,222,265,121,316,140,38,40,87,275,279,37,88,124,145,186,281,106,259,326,211,162,226,190,219,246,128,230,173,260,191,120,81,93,5,253,244,152,114,283,309,30,276,46,247,172,280,134,28,250,252,42,304,58,307,204,161,59,192,132,293,84,142,52,11,314,138,16,4,61","33,74,109,53,62","1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
172,"Brian kept quiet at the board meeting, who knew he had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.","Brian, a silent figure throughout the critical board meeting, held everyone's fate in his hands without them knowing. His deep brown eyes, scanning the room, hid the cunning of a chess grandmaster. All the while, he silently listened to the uninspired proposals, pointless discussions, and pointless power plays among his colleagues. 

The boardroom atmosphere was tense, filled with palpable nervous energy. The company was struggling. The stress was evident in the occasional outbursts and in the drawn, anxious faces around the table. Shareholders were demanding answers and drastic actions to save the sinking ship, but none of the presented solutions seemed promising.

Every manager, every executive had thrown in their suggestions. Some proposed budget cuts, others restructuring, and a few even suggested aggressive acquisitions. Yet, they all lacked the vision Brian had, the Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.

Throughout the meeting, his stoic expression never wavered. His years of experience had taught him to remain calm in turbulent times. Today was no different. He patiently waited for his turn, letting everyone exhaust their ideas and arguments, knowing that his would have the most significant impact.

As the hours wore on, the board members grew tired. The initial energy was dwindling; the strain of the day was visible on their faces. The room had turned into a battlefield of egos and desperation.

Brian had observed everyone's behavior keenly, waiting for the perfect moment to present his idea. He knew his colleagues and their strengths and weaknesses. It was his deep understanding of the business that had led him to this moment, that had given him his Ace.

Finally, as dusk was settling in, Brian cleared his throat. Every head in the room turned towards him. His silence throughout the day had added an element of intrigue to his impending speech. An eerie silence filled the room. Everyone held their breath as he started to present his radical idea.

With a calm demeanor, he shared his comprehensive plan, outlining the innovative restructuring, beneficial alliances, and strategic investments. The board members listened in shock as he unveiled his vision, which was creative yet pragmatic, aggressive yet calculated.

His proposal was like a breath of fresh air, a glimmer of hope in the face of imminent doom. He commanded the room, his authority and confidence apparent. By the time he finished his proposal, the room was electrified. There was hope, something they had been severely lacking since the onset of the crisis.

The rest of the meeting saw rigorous discussions, but the tone was different. There was an energy, a purpose. Brian's Ace had changed the game, created a spark, and started a process that would alter the company's course forever. His quiet demeanor had hidden a master plan the entire time, a plan that could save the sinking ship and guide them towards a brighter future.","273,196,112,329,5,199,332,256,126,42,200,175,21,202,101,268,331,168,251,105,174,96,144,247,18,13,215,11,73,122,50,39,252,321,43,87,47,287,152,201,44,88,69,133,22,263,164,54,242,77,163,197,224,317,184,7,220,266,310,291,241,279,190,156,313,333,286,337,335,325,193,169,111,228,216,40,100,109,59,132,75,60,189,147,205,179,9,3,74,308,38,55,295,167,330,221,305,309,186,123,290,246,155,285,65,328,139,56,173,98,124,338,234,257,226,322,141,327,170,294,143,320,162,137,92,198,165,99,46,203,121,219,301,103,78,72,62,245,213,19,91,89,269,20,85,296,277,95,176,154,188,25,255,260,217,107,120,4,212,0,106,15,240,76,250,82,311,223,222,261,16,191,130,115,93,158,53,297,298,272,180,117,237,30,183,177,303,267,160,324,66,108,181,336,161,304,211,232,41,236","109,21,12,149,186","1, 5, 10, 13, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29, 38, 42, 45, 48, 54, 60, 64, 67, 72, 76, 79, 84, 90, 95, 101, 106, 108, 112, 116, 119, 123, 127, 130, 132, 136, 139, 144, 148, 154, 160, 164, 168, 172, 177, 182, 186, 190, 195, 199, 200"
173,"The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.","For as long as he could remember, William McAllister had dedicated his life to politics. A third-generation statesman, he possessed an uncanny acumen for the machinations of the political realm. Above all, McAllister was a savvy politician. He was known for his strategic maneuvers that often left his opponents dumbfounded.

This electoral race was no different. His opponent this time was the popular and seemingly unassailable Senator John Hall. Hall's charisma and strong public appeal had been a challenge, even for someone as seasoned as McAllister. But McAllister had a secret weapon, a last-resort plan that he knew could sway the election in his favor.

Throughout the campaign, McAllister had been prudent. He carefully observed Hall, gathering bits of intelligence that could be used at a moment's notice. He retained a well-connected source who had insider knowledge about Hall's past. This secret contact had a piece of information, a scandalous secret that could make a difference in the intense competition.

As the days dwindled down to the final election day, McAllister kept this secret close to his chest. The time had to be perfect. Timing was everything. The public had to be attentive but not expecting anything unusual when the bombshell dropped. 

On the eve of the election, at the final debate, McAllister decided it was time. The tension in the room was palpable. Both candidates took their places on the stage. A harsh spotlight beat down on them as the audience awaited their statements.

In the midst of their exchange, McAllister saw his opportunity. With the calm demeanor of a seasoned politician, he released the scandalous secret about Senator Hall. The room fell silent; shocked gasps echoed through the crowd. 

McAllister revealed that Hall had been involved in a corruption scandal years before. Hall had been part of a cover-up operation involving city funds, a fact that had somehow remained buried until now. 

The revelation was a bombshell. For a few moments, the audience, the moderators, even Hall himself, sat in stunned silence. McAllister watched as Hall stammered, trying to deny the allegations. But he knew the damage was done. The seed of doubt had been planted in the minds of voters.

Overnight, the news exploded on media outlets. Social networks lit up with the scandal; pundits dissected Hall's past actions on national television. Hall's popularity fell drastically, his charismatic allure tainted by the scandal.

McAllister watched the proceedings from his campaign office, knowing he had played his card well. The decisive day arrived, and with the scandal still fresh in voters' minds, the savvy politician achieved his desired victory. All it took was a well-timed revelation of a scandalous secret.","132,253,0,78,185,154,320,199,175,134,212,289,247,1,310,276,128,94,141,80,147,81,124,204,135,234,205,211,2,275,339,150,158,59,26,159,285,172,142,99,254,162,151,209,301,88,221,226,145,153,138,225,296,140,97,110,43,192,115,96,222,82,10,68,166,240,277,178,149,30,313,174,12,33,20,91,76,251,264,25,46,304,92,106,156,281,322,45,31,67,112,306,274,181,183,55,334,319,62,176,243,4,288,116,146,282,223,317,47,237,290,160,323,21,65,169,143,11,51,48,336,200,163,36,157,214,213,90,206,83,121,72,53,137,305,328,58,79,278,19,23,263,89,268,233,241,327,70,27,286,236,87,103,314,232,207,131,144,127,41,259,245,129,332,66,224,231,155,44,303,196,32,114,98,171,60,113,5,177,117,170,52,73,279,100,331,16,188,309,330,54,107,292,302,189,202,7,227,270,39","38,72,9,100,179","1, 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, 22, 25, 27, 29, 34, 36, 38, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 62, 63, 66, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
174,"The opponents are unaware of my greatest asset, which is my stamina. The other runners have no chance at all!.","The city marathon was something everyone looked forward to each year. Every year the competition intensified, making it a prime event that drew both local and international participants. This year was no different. I was also among the many runners who had been training vigorously for the marathon. The competition this time was fierce. Renowned athletes from across the globe had gathered to participate.

Among my opponents, I saw many seasoned marathoners whose abilities and accomplishments had made headlines in the past. The prospect was intimidating, but I knew I had something they didn't. I held a secret weapon that none of them were aware of. 

My greatest asset, the one thing that sets me apart from the rest, was my exceptional stamina. A trait inherited from my ancestors, who had spent their lives in the harsh desert environment, surviving long treks without food or water. 

As the marathon began, the excitement was palpitable. My heart pounded as the starting gun fired, and off we all went, each determined to secure the first position. As the race progressed, the strong contenders began to become evident. Many runners shot out ahead, using their energy and speed from the get go.

I remained undeterred. My strategy was different from theirs. Knowing my strengths, I decided not to rush, but pace myself. I wanted to maintain a steady rhythm, conserving my energy and maximizing my stamina. 

My tactics were soon tested as the trail got tougher and the challenging gradients took a toll on many. I saw several runners losing their initial enthusiasm. Some were panting, others crumbled under the exhaustion, but I wasn't deterred. 

The harder the trail, the more determined I became. I felt my stamina surging, unfettered by the rigorous path. I wasn't the fastest, but I maintained a steady speed, systematically picking off the opponents who had initially passed me. 

Towards the end of the race, the finish line in sight, the once eager competitors were either burnt out or nursing cramps. The quick sprinters were now reduced to a slow hobble. It was then they realized they had underestimated my ability.

With an unwavering determination and the strength of my stamina, I managed to cross the finish line first, leaving the other runners behind. My opponents were stunned. They were totally unaware of my greatest asset, my stamina. They had assumed speed would determine the victor, but I had proven them wrong. They realised that speed could not compensate for stamina in the long run. 

In the end, all their expertise and past triumphs meant nothing against my relentless stamina. I had shown them that the other runners had no chance at all, simply because they were unaware of my greatest asset.","248,186,294,171,22,15,75,71,332,291,12,245,136,323,331,309,64,260,197,34,95,316,338,137,318,35,215,290,308,289,255,76,131,261,336,162,104,259,159,155,156,182,164,169,307,140,172,150,128,114,207,132,16,199,200,158,38,66,300,125,41,227,105,204,175,133,247,295,254,231,283,14,270,157,86,301,208,168,326,246,87,54,311,222,173,52,44,183,147,232,265,310,163,49,120,333,243,314,122,101,304,272,187,107,123,240,210,284,145,277,28,152,176,285,17,109,92,229,275,214,327,79,99,32,320,296,29,65,26,90,113,106,68,116,139,288,84,30,226,234,184,50,293,148,177,153,46,321,82,61,319,274,63,80,111,143,57,31,253,146,130,317,324,77,51,5,189,292,201,47,126,230,170,193,298,1,13,271,312,151,263,161,206,60,335,127,179,112,257,236,6,144,315,205,280,279,242,221,217,191","47,85,65,113,145","1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
175,I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown.,"As a journalist, I have spent a significant amount of time in courtrooms, tracking developments on major cases. This time, it was the trial of a prominent businessman accused of a gruesome murder. The case had held the city in its grip for months, not only due to the sheer violence but also the accused's notoriety. 

Rumors had begun to circulate amongst my colleagues, whispering in hushed tones. The defense lawyer, notorious for his tenacious courtroom strategies, reportedly had a fresh eyewitness. This person was previously unknown to both the public and legal entities involved.

Public interest in this trial was high. The prosecution had so far built a solid case against the accused businessman, backed by physical evidence and financial records linking him to the crime scene. Most assumed that this was an open-and-shut case. However, as the defense lawyer began to hint about this new witness, curiosity intensified.

Days turned into weeks, and the trial progressed, unfolding like a thriller novel. The judge, usually stoic, appeared visibly interested every time the defense lawyer alluded to this mysterious new witness. Everyone wanted to know: who was this person that had come out of nowhere? 

Finally, the day arrived when the defense lawyer announced he would call his fresh eyewitness to the stand. The courtroom was unusually packed that day, filled to the brim with journalists, curious spectators, and the family of both the victim and the accused.

An elderly man, frail yet confident, made his way to the stand. He introduced himself as a night guard from the neighborhood where the crime had occurred. As he narrated his version of that fateful night, the courtroom hung onto his every word. His testimony contradicted the prosecution's evidence, providing the businessman with a solid alibi.

His revelation led to a fresh wave of debate. Could this elderly security guard, previously unknown to the world, change the course of this high-profile trial? His testimony was compelling, but could it stand against the mounting evidence provided by the prosecution?

Each day, as the trial progressed, the defense lawyer strategically used the eyewitness's testimony to poke holes in the prosecution's case. The prosecution, on the other hand, seemed to scramble to discredit the eyewitness and validate their evidence. 

Finally, after long weeks, the verdict day arrived. The businessman, who had been a subject of public fury, looked surprisingly calm. The defense lawyer looked confident, thanks to his unexpected trump card, the eyewitness. The prosecution looked tense, wondering whether their case had been strong enough to counter the fresh evidence.

As the jury came back with the verdict, the courtroom went quiet. The defense lawyer had played his cards well with his previously unknown eyewitness. The businessman was found not guilty. Everyone was shocked; the fresh eyewitness had single-handedly swayed the trial, proving the power of an individual's voice in a court of law.","308,332,220,152,108,183,35,182,186,240,168,154,263,266,18,6,60,324,205,255,158,148,0,216,313,281,2,251,89,330,280,58,165,8,268,149,326,39,261,163,41,176,221,45,126,166,223,309,85,285,232,116,33,130,264,301,337,91,286,217,48,99,179,159,327,180,246,271,185,212,14,26,328,17,127,237,306,299,238,129,219,111,310,5,249,147,138,314,40,157,188,30,312,329,229,73,233,203,86,226,230,50,63,70,316,241,144,128,320,87,193,38,53,197,62,196,191,75,105,120,65,307,187,336,178,239,173,161,7,172,44,160,37,171,235,12,322,146,69,323,273,262,71,167,231,318,174,211,190,13,257,297,78,225,184,106,16,192,202,88,122,135,201,224,24,204,55,325,303,28,259,137,23,319,272,298,200,119,102,132,153,228,92,133,131,52,177,112,334,82,76,113,252,155,9,34,123,27,333,109","130,127,147,42,187","1, 4, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
176,They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back.,"The esteemed board of executives sat around the mahogany table at Parker & Sons, a reputable company known for its astute construction projects. They had just received the news that their fierce competitor, Davies Construction, seemed to have the upper hand in securing a major contract. According to the industry rumors, Davies Construction had almost secured the business deal that both companies had fiercely contested.

""The situation is looking bleak,"" one of the senior managers stated somberly. ""They think they’ve won the contract.""

Everyone seemed dispirited, but Sam Parker, the dynamic and resourceful CEO of Parker & Sons, did not allow the pessimistic undertone to sink into the room. ""But we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" he stated, refusing to surrender that easily.

He was known for turning the most hopeless of situations around. He looked at his team, a diverse group of skilled professionals, his eyes filled with faith and determination. He knew they were capable of overturning this setback.

Sam then outlined his first plan, to showcase their innovative techniques and superior technology in construction, which Davies Construction couldn’t match. The boardroom was suddenly abuzz with enthusiasm as the team began brainstorming on how best to bring this idea to fruition.

His second plan involved a unique blend of CSR initiatives aimed at giving back to the community. The company had always valued its corporate responsibility and this would indeed be a good chance to highlight their commitment. There was a strong belief that this move could make their bid more attractive.

The third plan centered around emphasizing their exemplary record of completing projects on time with stringent quality checks. This was one aspect where they had the edge over their competitor. The team knew this could make a big impact.

The next few days were chaotic as everyone worked hard to execute these plans. They tirelessly refined their contract proposal, incorporating Sam's plans. On the side, they also conducted an aggressive PR campaign, showcasing their company's strengths and commitments to the public and industry stakeholders.

The D-day finally arrived when they had to present their revised proposal. With their innovative strategies, commitment to community, and an unmatched track record, they left the panel astounded. The belief in the room was evident - Parker & Sons had undoubtedly given the panel much to think about.

In the end, Sam's optimism and the team's relentless effort paid off. Parker & Sons was awarded the contract, leaving Davies Construction bewildered. They proved that an apparent setback could be turned into a splendid victory with sheer determination, teamwork, and a few great ideas.","174,23,122,75,14,280,196,142,234,279,337,226,26,112,209,224,51,152,118,171,49,98,322,206,190,83,212,45,269,0,88,161,95,24,36,63,156,320,182,65,241,238,20,168,91,277,329,255,3,249,172,310,253,222,33,5,90,101,321,216,260,170,117,291,300,105,134,225,106,246,256,58,194,159,110,221,302,327,120,166,242,84,97,336,141,316,9,56,151,258,42,233,28,157,266,128,130,261,113,29,64,232,136,331,4,40,2,70,325,72,8,229,30,131,294,123,54,252,150,154,198,189,236,324,79,82,25,288,214,107,1,217,240,181,32,275,114,180,31,175,76,187,116,111,11,204,177,199,307,263,15,314,34,332,283,186,18,22,129,149,53,333,109,6,46,306,135,290,71,179,160,213,330,143,52,85,80,317,27,183,147,309,19,13,313,205,78,262,173,208,48,308,124,121,67,37,235,339,74,304","51,189,1,140,147","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
177,She cannot be dismissed because she is aware of the boss's shady business dealings.,"Once upon a time, in the bustling world of corporate America, there worked a woman named Anna. She was a woman of intelligence, with eyes as sharp as an eagle's and an instinct as keen as a fox. Her job, however, was far from simple; she was the secretary to a high-powered executive, Mr. Gary Robert.

Her boss, Mr. Robert, was a man with a silver tongue and a charismatic charm that attracted many. But beneath his appealing demeanor, he was a shrewd and calculating man. Anna observed, with growing distaste, his unethical business practices that often strayed into shady territories. She discovered his involvement in a series of underhand dealings, leaving her in an uncomfortable situation.

Anna had considered reporting him, but she quickly realized the implications. She was aware of the rampant corruption at the higher level. It wasn't just about losing her job, it was about losing the battle against the corporate giant. 

Anna knew that the information she possessed had power and potential consequences. She was in a precarious situation; if she left, she could potentially be silenced, or worse, implicated. However, if she stayed, she'd be enabling the continuation of these illicit activities. It was a decision that weighed heavily on her conscience.

She tried to keep quiet, but her sense of integrity prickled at her conscience. She yearned for justice and righteousness but found herself tethered by fear and a sense of helplessness. She felt the growing frustration every day when she had to look at the man who committed those acts, who sat behind the mahogany desk, utterly unscathed.

Every day, Anna grappled with her moral dilemma while fulfilling her duties efficiently. She noticed that Mr. Robert relied heavily on her, recognizing her diligence and sharpness. It was at this point, she realized a unique advantage she had - Mr. Robert was unaware that she knew his secrets. 

The very thought of it empowered her. She started meticulously collecting evidence, finding solace in her small defiance. She knew she couldn't be easily dismissed because her boss unknowingly needed her, and she had valuable information that could expose him.

Finally, one night, under the shroud of darkness, Anna, with a heavy heart, started constructing an anonymous email. She attached all the necessary documents and addressed the email to various news agencies, law enforcement bodies, and competitor companies. 

Though she was aware that she could not be dismissed for her knowledge, she was also aware of the risks involved. Anna hit the send button with a sigh of mixed anxiety and relief. Only time would tell what would come from her bold actions.","128,183,271,318,165,49,315,332,227,118,339,24,259,109,253,338,225,40,62,228,34,149,76,270,269,313,101,116,238,243,163,115,124,282,69,195,112,319,0,314,283,326,291,286,100,178,317,74,265,119,30,295,217,121,97,247,110,281,47,231,96,285,158,147,268,99,254,32,107,273,176,240,85,172,138,77,95,130,108,125,289,57,307,22,209,66,257,43,201,129,1,321,90,78,153,133,10,152,35,16,236,335,25,274,65,2,196,278,11,137,134,29,320,150,8,303,136,210,192,205,92,171,220,80,336,324,327,75,189,272,182,179,191,263,207,325,290,267,194,184,55,328,216,245,186,167,308,141,330,89,103,42,188,37,168,249,142,33,241,174,73,175,45,23,173,39,246,105,160,219,215,104,155,114,83,4,232,61,305,316,54,63,279,159,187,204,88,79,304,288,301,44,306,312,5,323,148,151,214,9","74,165,160,162,71","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
178,I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.,"My relationship with Richard had always been a complicated one, tainted with both love and resentment. He was an acquaintance of mine, introduced by a common friend at a local pub. Richard was quick-witted and could captivate an entire crowd with his charm. Everyone around us admired him, and I was no different. But there was one thing about Richard that I just couldn't bring myself to admire, his lack of respect towards me.

The incident that sparked my resentment dates back to a few months ago. We were at our favorite pub, surrounded by our group of friends, as usual. The air was filled with laughter, stories, and the rich aroma of beers and burgers. I began to share an experience of mine that I thought was incredibly funny, but Richard was quick to belittle me and cut me off.

His reaction was utterly unexpected, a sharp contrast to his usual charismatic persona. His mockery of me in front of everyone was a blow to my pride. He followed it up with a smirk and turned to the others, initiating a new conversation. The laughter continued, but a cold feeling of humiliation crept up my spine.

After the incident, our friends brushed off his behavior as him being in one of his 'moods.' Yet, something inside me changed that day. The smiles that once warmed my heart now seemed fake, and his once charming chatter appeared disrespectful. I could not dismiss his mockery and disrespect towards me.

As the days passed, Richard's lack of respect for me became more apparent. He'd make snide remarks at my expense, trivialize my ideas, and brush off my concerns as insignificant. The more he did this, the more evident his disregard for me became.

I started distancing myself from him, hoping that my growing resentment would fade. I spent less time at our usual hangouts, cut down on our conversations, and even avoided eye contact with him. But each encounter with Richard only fueled my disdain.

My friends tried to mediate the situation, pleading with Richard to make amends. But he shrugged it off nonchalantly, as if it didn't concern him at all. This casual dismissal further deepened my resentment towards him. It felt as though my feelings and my self-worth meant nothing to him.

In the end, I hold it against him for not treating me with respect. It wasn't about a single incident anymore, but his consistent lack of regard for me. I couldn't brush off his disrespect, neither could I laugh it off as mere banter.

Richard's charm and wit may be admirable, but the respect for another human being is a fundamental trait that he lacks. This realization made me see Richard for what he truly was – a person who could charm the crowds but lacked the basic courtesy of respecting others. And for that reason alone, I hold it against him. It's not about holding grudges, but upholding my self-respect and dignity.","44,260,152,93,99,269,320,3,125,42,259,289,226,209,236,86,77,286,92,154,222,100,224,8,228,330,47,12,148,62,244,156,331,61,328,218,243,317,240,140,126,314,182,60,14,142,225,251,307,297,241,306,25,73,134,28,11,227,215,151,160,263,59,242,54,34,318,295,255,71,204,262,186,300,310,4,172,304,48,325,293,200,117,267,96,311,23,83,302,191,179,169,329,91,170,7,56,220,250,188,334,118,229,88,212,89,133,252,336,217,165,21,171,214,184,290,57,150,105,280,279,327,79,74,124,253,238,284,18,185,147,114,257,122,72,81,101,84,119,146,338,80,15,322,162,315,95,175,75,136,69,135,309,323,174,296,291,20,155,36,270,337,138,177,17,194,128,274,26,198,55,130,129,272,180,288,29,145,285,1,173,38,324,70,78,111,137,163,53,76,27,268,183,305,158,30,108,157,181,308","91,175,199,43,193","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110"
179,I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.,"From the moment I first laid eyes on Kim, we were inseparable. Our friendship was kindled in the sandbox at kindergarten and had only grown stronger over time. We stood by each other through first crushes, heartbreaks, and graduations, always vowing to be each other's rock. With this history, one could understand why I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.

Kim was there when I met David. She was there when he asked me out, and she was there when he proposed. She witnessed the love blossom, and her approval of David was important to me. But when I told her that I was getting married to him, her reaction was cold and distant, unlike the excited squeal I had imagined.

For a moment, I felt disbelief. I reasoned with myself that perhaps she was dealing with something in her personal life, but no such thing came to light. When I asked her about being my maid of honor, she simply declined without giving any reasons.

I was heartbroken. My best friend, who was a part of all my life's milestones, was opting out of the most important day of my life. Her refusal cast a shadow over my wedding preparations, and every decision I made was tinged with a feeling of loss and betrayal.

I was mad and hurt. I felt betrayed and lost. My joyous occasion seemed incomplete without her. No matter how much I wanted to dismiss her absence and focus on my big day, it was easier said than done.

I began questioning our friendship, wondering if I had done something to push her away. Every time I sent her an invitation, I hoped she would change her mind, but to no avail. The absence of her name in my guest list was a stark reminder of her refusal to stand by my side.

Despite my best efforts to not let her decision affect me, the pain lingered. Each congratulatory hug, each well-meaning smile, served as a cruel reminder of what I was missing. 

Finally, my wedding day came. It was as beautiful and joyful as I had hoped, but there was a gaping hole in the picture. The spot where Kim was supposed to stand was filled by a substitute who, though kind, was not Kim. 

It felt strange to receive the wedding vows without Kim being there to share my happiness. I had pictured this moment with her for years, but now I stood there without her.

As I glanced at the empty chair reserved for Kim, my eyes filled with tears. There was anger, yes, but more than that, there was a deep, profound sadness. That was the moment I realized, I was mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding. I was also heartbroken over what seemed like the end of a friendship that I thought would last a lifetime.","157,2,68,275,171,10,260,142,322,329,165,17,181,156,33,238,39,271,110,134,178,263,159,60,218,247,57,41,36,186,232,196,200,108,154,152,42,307,293,177,314,82,126,130,333,231,256,88,324,249,95,334,259,18,302,47,237,323,315,32,246,127,180,81,93,300,212,102,325,321,63,149,53,294,227,19,98,48,225,22,198,277,115,170,304,272,189,114,248,328,128,276,270,173,52,90,107,172,289,266,75,280,23,12,243,96,265,61,193,148,221,0,59,38,331,303,11,16,327,147,113,284,215,5,336,26,273,279,182,338,285,104,202,116,120,111,220,214,250,262,78,317,20,143,103,211,207,37,164,97,14,133,310,158,124,44,257,291,309,1,292,228,183,83,125,318,94,201,217,163,76,70,4,85,27,49,109,155,106,281,299,229,123,286,311,252,56,251,71,176,119,51,312,335,234,223,141,135,244,9","21,63,13,129,163","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
180,I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.,"The incident that led to my resentment towards Nick happened at a social gathering. It was the annual Christmas party our firm organized, a night everyone looked forward to with exhilarating anticipation. The atmosphere was brimming with laughter, chatter, and an ambiance of camaraderie that night.

Nick was my colleague, an accomplished lawyer. He was seen as a mentor by some, a respected figure in our firm. I admired him as well, having been fresh out of law school, eager to learn, and perform. Everyone knew Nick to be assertive and direct, but on that day, he crossed a line.

During the party, a round of toasts was called for; a tradition we often indulged in. Each of us took turns to talk about our accomplishments, share funny anecdotes, or simply wish each other well. I waited excitedly for my turn, a fresh memory of successfully closing my first case ripe in my mind.

When my turn arrived, I stood up, glass raised high, and shared my excitement about my first successful case with everyone present. I beamed with pride, expecting to hear words of encouragement or a light-hearted joke. However, the response I received was a harsh blow.

Nick, in his sharp suit, took the center stage, after I finished my narration. His cold laughter rang through the room, mocking my pride. He began by calling my win ""novice's luck,"" reducing my accomplishment to a mere fortunate incident. Then he scrutinized my every move during the case and ridiculed my strategies, making me feel minuscule.

His words were not constructive criticism, but a blatant display of arrogance and disrespect. His comments made me feel unworthy, diminishing my confidence significantly. The laughter and chatter that filled the room earlier had vanished, replaced by an uncomfortable silence. I could see empathy on some faces, while others tried to hide their amusement.

Nick had humiliated me in front of my colleagues and our seniors, snatching away my moment of triumph with his vindictive words. I felt my heart pounding in my chest, and my cheeks burned with humiliation. I managed a weak smile, trying to mask the hurt as I sat down, the room filled with Nick's cold laughter.

I remember driving home that night, replaying the incident in my mind, my heart filled with anger and disappointment. To this day, I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party. He had turned a moment of joy and accomplishment into a memory of humiliation and pain. His actions were not of a mentor but of a man who enjoyed belittling others. I vowed that night to never allow anyone, including Nick, to belittle my achievements or make me feel less.","280,240,336,115,212,22,202,165,163,253,81,338,325,13,136,339,323,192,201,111,50,56,179,112,174,57,72,27,156,250,209,281,28,32,268,171,75,181,147,304,123,51,66,5,273,59,19,37,67,12,316,261,89,62,135,31,300,335,120,124,142,319,45,208,73,307,221,246,95,155,271,329,265,16,127,296,168,222,43,292,87,29,83,52,133,76,125,223,4,33,206,226,183,38,161,145,229,332,173,194,103,130,318,107,153,100,104,293,313,110,46,274,88,91,284,105,25,295,23,164,219,63,15,78,86,196,217,279,154,60,18,79,54,277,68,96,8,309,312,320,26,182,97,49,134,122,121,237,159,322,249,321,144,119,166,40,188,283,197,158,327,6,247,204,94,114,138,176,178,113,243,235,20,290,55,231,80,308,305,228,294,193,14,82,24,169,252,239,272,245,151,84,3,215,129,99,143,216,44,172","169,23,38,142,93","1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
181,Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.,"Once upon a time, Sam and Peter were the best of friends. Their bond was unique and they would share everything with each other. Sam, being the kind-hearted soul that she was, was always open with Peter. She even confided her deepest insecurities and fears in him.

One of these insecurities was her acute stage fright. Being an aspiring theater actress, she had always found it challenging to perform in front of an audience. Peter was the only one who knew about this, and Sam had trusted him to keep it between them.

One day, they were all seated in the school auditorium. Their drama teacher was announcing the lead role for the upcoming school play. She, quite unexpectedly, chose Sam for the role. A wave of terror washed over Sam. However, she decided to take this as a challenge and nodded in agreement.

Peter, instead of supporting her, laughed audibly from the corner. He made fun of her anxiety by mimicking her jittery movements and nervous stutter. The whole auditorium resonated with laughter. Sam felt a deep sting of betrayal and embarrassment. It was as if Peter had used her vulnerabilities as ammunition to amuse others.

She felt her cheeks flush red and she quickly exited the auditorium. She felt the whispers and laughter follow her even after she had shut the door behind her. Sam's heart throbbed with pain and humiliation, but most of all, with betrayal.

That night, as she laid on her bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, she made a decision. A decision not to engage with Peter anymore, not in a friendly manner at least. His laughter echoed in her mind and her own vulnerabilities looked back at her like a monster under her bed.

The next day, Sam walked into school with a newly found determination. She avoided Peter's attempts to talk to her and refused to acknowledge his apologetic looks. She was hurt and decided it was time she put herself first.

However, Sam didn't let Peter's hurtful actions deter her ambitions. She worked hard, putting all her insecurities behind her, and delivered a marvelous performance on the day of the play. The applause from the audience made her realize her self-worth and she stepped off the stage, beaming with pride.

But she didn't forget Peter's actions. His insensitive joke had marked a permanent dent in their friendship. She carried on with her life, focusing on her passion for acting, without Peter by her side. This decision wasn't easy for Sam, but it was a necessary step for her personal growth and self-respect.","255,134,2,211,268,8,219,12,209,80,196,62,260,244,13,39,179,221,287,322,28,1,18,11,303,106,264,271,301,239,218,57,335,58,194,35,84,166,240,25,205,88,26,281,165,145,214,320,50,202,48,101,337,119,172,107,127,184,185,279,163,333,190,155,180,278,290,130,47,293,146,329,175,64,288,69,68,226,5,22,92,65,164,183,261,270,19,124,298,158,316,162,41,243,96,51,52,198,29,314,231,116,178,67,200,215,291,269,327,23,285,267,94,282,216,137,173,104,305,300,156,114,238,245,76,61,105,90,109,138,195,280,141,9,103,152,294,186,15,302,3,117,98,307,73,334,235,217,339,265,150,228,111,34,0,251,93,49,56,207,259,171,99,328,113,319,310,53,249,253,79,132,263,275,336,236,157,272,108,133,309,224,177,325,274,120,176,250,144,10,118,182,330,32,296,27,318,95,36,14","103,17,65,192,84","1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
182,Karen is upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.,"Karen had been anticipating the end of spring. She had been planning for a fantastic summer, hoping to share adventures with her long-time friend Sandy. However, as the month of June was about to roll in, she found herself upset.

For over a decade, Karen and Sandy had been spending their summers together. Every year, they set aside time to map out their vacations, scheduling fun road trips, beach outings, hiking expeditions and more. This ritual was what made their friendship special and unique. 

This year though, things were strikingly different. Karen noticed that Sandy had been avoiding their yearly planning session. Each time Karen brought it up, Sandy deflected the conversation, making up excuses or changing the subject.

As the weeks passed, Karen felt a shift in their friendship. Sandy's evasiveness stirred up feelings of disappointment in Karen. Karen didn't quite understand what was happening, and Sandy's constant avoidance only heightened her confusion.

Then one day, Karen overheard Sandy talking to someone over the phone. She was discussing some grand summer plans. Plans that involved overseas travel, a beach house, snorkeling, and even skydiving. Everything they had ever dreamt of doing together. 

The pain of Sandy not sharing these plans was inexplicable. She had envisioned spending yet another memorable summer together, while Sandy seemed to have moved on without her. The realization hit Karen hard.

Feeling betrayed, Karen decided to confront Sandy. She waited for the right time and finally brought up the summer plans, the phone conversation she overheard. Sandy seemed taken aback, hesitating before finally admitting to her secret summer plans. 

Sandy tried explaining that the plans were last minute, unplanned. She insisted she wanted to tell Karen but couldn't find the right time. But for Karen, these words were empty excuses. She was deeply hurt, feeling like Sandy was just pushing her away.

Despite her frustration and sadness, Karen realized it was not completely in her hands. While Sandy was responsible for her actions, Karen too had to respect Sandy's choices. She missed the old times, the camaraderie they once shared.

Karen decided to take time and space to deal with her emotions. Although she felt betrayed, she wanted to preserve what was left of their friendship. This summer might not be as they had planned, but she hoped that this ordeal would, in the end, strengthen their relationship. For now, Karen was upset with Sandy. But she was hopeful that their years of shared friendship wouldn't just wash away with one summer's change of plans.","305,257,135,303,218,26,204,7,266,216,232,52,92,49,227,78,291,167,243,28,41,192,328,19,96,103,122,339,21,323,229,276,119,140,114,311,202,109,5,220,245,212,279,50,30,296,270,90,325,60,293,282,285,24,205,294,299,258,233,17,230,18,226,107,156,22,335,203,68,225,163,43,79,286,254,295,274,278,142,288,331,317,75,221,65,174,284,313,162,261,34,12,40,14,33,66,91,2,201,132,238,151,116,117,196,29,145,138,143,301,82,62,324,250,73,319,110,115,83,283,289,126,1,330,87,193,191,188,13,208,11,150,298,231,9,207,187,183,240,125,309,223,88,102,124,130,189,255,248,53,123,264,121,148,179,45,211,46,58,307,166,64,198,267,251,253,181,259,297,190,104,164,219,108,3,146,159,336,260,77,184,304,178,265,139,47,72,180,228,32,105,147,168,39,236,8,312,269,100,48","183,155,188,167,138","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
183,Mary stopped talking to Amy because of the way she spoke to her last time.,"Mary was always a calm and patient woman, particularly when it came to her friendships. She was known for her forgiving nature and unending patience, traits that were rarely found. However, something changed the dynamics of her friendship with Amy one summer afternoon.

Amy and Mary had been friends since they were little girls, their bond deepening over shared homework assignments, teenage heartbreaks, college experiences, and adult life challenges. But on one sunny afternoon, while they were having their usual lunch at their favorite downtown cafe, an incident occurred that changed everything. 

Amy, burdened by a series of personal challenges, was not her usual cheery self. Struggling to cope with her stress, she took out her frustration unknowingly on Mary. Mary, unsuspecting, bore the brunt of Amy's harsh words and scathing criticism. Amy spoke to her in a way that she had never done before. Her words were icy and sharp, creating an unseen wound in Mary's heart.

Mary tried to understand, to give Amy the benefit of the doubt. After all, everyone has bad days. However, Amy's words left a deeper impression than she had imagined. Mary was hurt and felt betrayed; the person she had considered her confidante had pierced her with her words. The way Amy spoke to her was condescending and dismissive, far from the friendly banter they usually engaged in.

Mary could never forget that conversation. The cruel twist of her friend's face as she spat out hurtful words still haunted her. Her heart ached every time she thought about it. So, she decided it was best for her own peace to stop talking to Amy. Mary understood that everyone had their struggles, but she refused to be someone's emotional punching bag.

Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Mary maintained her silence towards Amy, despite her several attempts at reconciliation. Amy regretted her words, but it was too late. The damage had been done. 

Mary didn't hold a grudge against Amy, but she felt the need to distance herself. She needed time to heal and to regain her emotional balance. The incident had made her realize that their friendship wasn't as sturdy as she believed. Mary had finally grasped the lesson that sometimes, even the longest friendships can waver under the strain of harsh words.

And so, she continued her life, doing her best to move on from the past. There were days when she missed her friend, but she knew she had made the right decision. After all, Mary had always believed in treating others the way one wanted to be treated. If that couldn’t be reciprocated, it was better to walk away. And that was why Mary stopped talking to Amy because of the way she spoke to her last time.","94,67,186,131,110,274,205,127,232,223,32,1,293,132,237,163,201,37,243,66,181,339,14,51,61,276,9,89,85,238,326,228,165,166,43,83,27,306,121,300,116,39,81,108,295,119,284,258,151,185,250,182,190,155,20,202,103,120,31,129,93,298,198,87,98,36,146,115,161,311,80,102,317,21,91,105,59,221,235,288,207,254,162,139,142,109,217,301,6,225,233,128,17,72,58,282,86,246,16,75,240,34,104,2,304,140,319,211,224,305,214,271,329,158,33,281,196,222,267,79,322,117,24,148,118,263,44,242,241,55,178,193,111,252,68,277,106,325,122,209,13,227,152,292,100,332,144,239,53,19,145,215,40,175,334,280,251,197,191,171,194,283,179,156,56,287,164,308,141,249,188,289,290,54,63,336,337,328,52,324,192,307,3,268,180,153,296,208,291,314,285,256,247,269,187,135,62,312,15,11","131,163,185,21,52","1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 36, 38, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
184,Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth since the audition was about to be closed.,"Lester always had a dream of making it onto the high school dance team. However, balancing academics and his part-time job didn't leave him with a lot of free time for extracurricular activities. As much as he admired the fluid and intricate movements of the dancers, he hesitated to audition due to his demanding schedule.

One day, as he worked at his part-time job at a local café, he overheard a group of girls talking about the final round of auditions for the dance team. It struck him that this would be the last chance for him to accomplish his dream. He looked at the clock. There was only one hour left before the auditions would be closed.

An adrenaline rush surged through him. He apologized to his boss, leaving his half-finished latte on the counter and ran as fast as he could. His heart pounded against his chest as he sprinted towards the auditorium, desperate not to be late.

With just a few minutes to spare, he burst through the auditorium doors, panting heavily. The audition room was filled with the sweet sound of classical music and the sight of pirouetting dancers. A rush of awe and intimidation swept over him.

Trying to regain his composure, he quickly changed into his dance attire. He didn't have much time for a warm-up or practice; he just hoped his previous practice would carry him through.

As the last few contestants finished their performances, Lester was summoned to the stage. He felt a knot in his stomach, his hands were sweaty, and he couldn’t stop his leg from shaking. But despite his nerves, he walked onto the stage with as much confidence as he could muster.

The music began, and he lost himself in the rhythm, performing every step he’d practiced in his living room. He danced like he never had before, with all his passion and energy shining through every movement. As the music gradually faded, Lester finished his routine with a final, breathtaking leap.

The room was silent for what seemed like an eternity. Then, a round of applause erupted from the judges' table and swept across the room. They were impressed by his raw talent and commitment.

As the audition was about to be closed, the announcement came. Lester had made the dance team, but just barely. By the skin of his teeth, he had accomplished his dream. He was elated. Despite his doubts and all the obstacles he had faced, he had made it.

From then on, Lester no longer just admired the fluid and intricate movements of the dancers; he became one of them. Every twirl, every leap he made, was a testament to his passion and the commitment he had shown that fateful day. The day he made the dance team by the skin of his teeth.","253,132,36,188,221,204,66,59,252,142,92,107,302,196,297,246,187,199,265,113,223,47,88,139,41,282,331,211,262,292,224,63,45,50,308,207,54,49,156,2,76,319,277,110,27,93,272,68,316,10,304,146,19,197,283,28,108,285,256,100,279,164,178,112,111,227,194,161,299,205,17,171,11,333,167,339,75,249,109,13,190,58,106,119,117,192,176,62,144,217,290,212,189,158,251,34,77,81,203,338,38,177,141,174,179,274,322,245,259,183,14,151,153,315,311,220,140,130,202,64,332,180,168,261,70,143,266,239,186,298,323,257,105,43,74,115,150,191,291,300,244,314,198,135,12,102,241,209,218,318,123,334,293,101,255,275,247,210,86,193,208,324,116,61,73,55,3,225,286,138,243,145,327,103,254,166,312,104,228,219,296,83,7,22,35,85,306,181,8,20,42,222,185,206,24,91,313,129,94,87","193,129,17,4,93","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
185,"While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.","In a society dominated by an oppressive regime, the fearsome secret police were infamous for their ruthlessness and efficiency. They were an ever-present shadow in the lives of the populace, a manifestation of the government's control over their every move. This pervasive force was also known for its almost infallible ability to track down and capture any dissidents. So naturally, people believed it was impossible to escape their clutches once targeted.

Amid these bleak realities, there was a man named Peter. A quiet, unassuming figure, he was, in fact, a beacon of resistance against this oppressive regime. His audacious actions and biting words had not only earned him the respect of the suppressed masses, but it also brought him under the secret police's radar. The hunt for him intensified, and Peter knew it was only a matter of time before they closed in on him.

One evening, an unexpected knock on his door signaled that his worst fears had come to fruition. The secret police had finally caught up with him. However, Peter was a man of quick wits. Having anticipated this eventuality, he already had a meticulous plan of escape at hand.

In the commotion that ensued, Peter managed to escape through a hidden tunnel built beneath his house. The tunnel led to the vast wilderness that lied beyond the city borders. The secret police were baffled and their operations thrown into disarray. They frantically searched his house, hoping to uncover any clues about his potential whereabouts.

Meanwhile, Peter trekked through the harsh terrain of the wilderness, constantly on the move to evade capture. It was a relentless cat-and-mouse game between him and the secret police, the stakes being his life and freedom. The chase was intense, days turned into weeks, yet the relentless pursuit showed no signs of slowing down.

The secret police remained close on his trail, but their determination was matched by Peter's resilience and will to escape. Several close encounters with the secret police made his escape dangerous and stressful. With each passing day, Peter was barely able to stay a step ahead of them.

Then came the day when he narrowly escaped an ambush in a deserted village. He had been trapped but somehow managed to fight his way out, bruised and battered but not broken. It was a bit too close for comfort. But Peter was undeterred. He knew there was no going back.

Eventually, he managed to lose their trail, using his survival skills and cunning to outwit his pursuers. It took a tremendous toll on him physically and emotionally, but he did it. He escaped from the clutches of the secret police, proving that the impossible could indeed be possible.

Word of his successful escape reached the oppressed populace, infusing them with hope. Peter became a living testament to the fact that the oppressive regime and their secret police could be defied and outsmarted. His escape not only affirmed his personal courage but also signaled the possibility of resistance against tyranny. Despite the closeness of his encounters, Peter's escape was a triumph that would forever be etched in the annals of their collective resistance.","110,280,118,84,63,214,59,219,96,12,14,196,202,278,208,126,46,265,31,334,22,187,232,160,168,130,326,175,155,262,186,62,319,23,256,149,154,206,261,189,122,20,330,263,200,87,216,133,273,248,264,210,47,229,153,259,316,173,166,42,30,25,212,281,268,49,115,331,313,11,323,167,302,48,230,158,296,111,169,147,8,176,213,75,303,76,218,29,95,27,100,43,9,145,7,291,271,107,170,275,88,82,124,201,106,135,117,91,114,177,247,241,92,246,332,79,333,250,40,327,28,325,131,282,57,116,283,195,238,197,156,90,101,249,243,314,179,207,77,335,234,64,98,337,217,305,301,257,309,317,45,97,159,60,300,24,287,134,178,288,73,125,321,113,284,50,137,67,239,140,93,18,138,221,270,311,85,103,236,260,279,58,286,188,104,235,121,16,251,198,53,322,83,150,255,61,228,184,292,298","198,31,22,184,40","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
186,The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.,"A group of five marketing students at Hunter College, had been working on a comprehensive project for their final semester. The project, which was titled ""An In-depth Study of Contemporary Marketing Strategies"", was meant to encapsulate everything they had learned throughout their four-year course. 

This formidable team was led by Benjamin, a charismatic individual with a knack for delegation. He was perfectly complemented by Grace, the analytical mind of the group, and Matthew, their creative spark. Then there were Julia and Oliver, both of whom were task-oriented and steadfast in their work.

The project was extensive and required substantial research, which left them working into the early hours of the morning on most days. It wasn't uncommon for them to be found in the library until the wee hours of dawn, rifling through a pile of marketing books and articles. Their determination and passion for their field of study had them committed to the project with an unmatched intensity.

However, things didn't always go as planned. Two weeks before the deadline, they realized that they had missed a critical section of the project; the evaluation of social media as a marketing tool. This realization sent a wave of panic through the group. They began to worry about the possibility of not being able to complete the project in time.

The atmosphere within the group grew tense. Time was slipping through their fingers, and the incomplete portion of the project loomed ominously over their heads. But Benjamin, the leader, decided to take the bull by the horns. He split up the remaining work amongst the group, assigning social media channels to each member to evaluate and report on.

Every moment following this decision was consumed by rigorous research, writing, and editing. Matthew put his creativity to work, designing infographics and charts to make the presentation more engaging. Meanwhile, Grace and Benjamin labored to ensure the writing was of the highest quality.

The day of the deadline arrived. They were making final adjustments and proofreading the project one last time. Despite their immense stress, they had developed a rhythm and an unspoken understanding, which helped them in managing the last-minute jitters.

With only an hour left, Grace noticed a minor inconsistency in the data, which threatened the credibility of their entire study. The group plunged into a state of frenzy, hurriedly fixing the error and adjusting the subsequent analysis.

Finally, two minutes before the submission deadline, they had their report ready. Benjamin, after taking one final look, clicked on the 'submit' button. The group collectively exhaled, relief washing over them. Their relentless dedication and effort had managed to save them, and they had managed to submit their project just in time.

The sense of accomplishment and unity they felt was unmatched, as they left the library under the early morning light, their monumental task finally complete. They knew they had given their all to this project, making it a reflection of their capabilities and determination.","199,306,179,59,84,335,4,158,65,257,299,117,275,237,80,102,272,233,326,19,121,142,232,219,66,210,249,239,130,129,262,327,144,88,175,302,11,215,222,298,171,42,187,70,273,180,197,112,151,7,246,103,40,240,162,316,184,285,82,34,10,282,107,39,329,234,37,218,115,286,165,75,247,305,106,46,339,31,33,238,99,188,248,213,8,251,89,198,95,309,178,100,157,18,56,230,166,53,5,269,317,189,29,288,73,287,118,212,176,74,307,259,328,15,221,323,51,201,137,319,322,131,81,140,209,138,276,320,336,161,205,168,290,44,202,45,64,108,264,145,245,314,291,193,72,236,110,30,293,14,28,185,109,169,38,278,79,48,91,206,147,94,133,96,93,136,324,58,6,304,60,242,97,266,216,134,226,61,283,77,2,337,57,313,310,196,156,301,181,321,203,26,76,174,105,36,12,289,318,332","57,152,43,82,102","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
187,He made the final cut to the university just by a small margin.,"Benjamin Thompson had always been a dreamer. Since his childhood days, the aspiration of attending a prestigious university had always shimmered in the back of his mind. This dream was fuelled by his insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge, which was visible in his wide-eyed wonderment at every new piece of information he encountered.

Raised in a small town, the resources to satiate his intellectual curiosity were limited. Yet, Benjamin managed. He roamed the narrow library aisles, hungrily devouring every book he could lay his hands on. His home, although modest, was filled with the thick scent of parchment, a testament to his relentless pursuit of knowledge.

As Benjamin grew older, his goal solidified, and his dream university became more than an abstract idea. Now, it was the prestigious Harvard University, renowned for its academic rigor and intellectual prowess. The mere thought of being part of such an environment made his heart flutter with excitement.

However, he knew that it was a daunting task. From the demanding application process to the rigorous entrance exams, each step was designed to challenge even the most adept minds. But he was undeterred, for he knew the sweet taste of success was even better when the journey was fraught with challenges.

Months rolled into years as Benjamin dedicated himself to his studies, his dreams of Harvard ever in his mind. Eventually, the time came when he received the letter of admission. The envelope seemed innocuous, but he knew that it held his dreams.

With trembling hands, he tore open the envelope. His eyes darted across the page, searching for that crucial sentence. Then, his heart sank. The letter stated, ""Based on your performance in the entrance examination, we are pleased to inform you of your admission.""

Benjamin was overjoyed. He had made the final cut, albeit by a small margin. The realization washed over him, drenching him in a wave of relief and euphoria. His hard work had paid off. His dream was now becoming a reality.

The tale of his accomplishment quickly spread through his small town, sparking admiration and respect amongst the townsfolk. The proud glint in his parents' eyes was proof enough of the enormity of his achievement. Benjamin Thompson, the dreamer and aspiring academic, was now a Harvard admit.

His story, however, was more than just one of triumph. It was a testament to his perseverance, his unwavering determination to chase his dreams, despite the odds. While he had made the final cut just by a small margin, to Benjamin, it was a monumental victory, a giant leap towards a future full of promise and opportunity. Benjamin Thompson had dared to dream big, and now, he was ready to soar higher than ever before.","245,317,174,235,111,147,273,65,193,267,156,234,325,54,202,324,185,20,333,288,43,332,299,198,283,69,305,233,39,123,148,322,63,102,284,145,81,103,247,286,314,259,189,154,68,213,76,260,172,280,44,320,149,188,6,313,274,34,60,121,155,71,92,265,138,158,339,256,72,335,308,337,238,128,195,180,4,192,236,152,12,179,252,177,244,27,93,58,173,114,112,221,140,237,181,57,196,222,219,91,25,53,262,169,277,240,191,285,216,225,278,183,312,223,171,178,218,253,184,306,109,126,83,255,23,118,19,276,176,230,194,250,327,79,113,211,254,296,32,22,251,212,166,228,98,303,146,59,143,287,316,258,210,66,199,35,107,10,24,207,75,203,86,268,239,214,160,323,319,90,271,7,13,266,131,141,110,48,33,326,186,78,0,144,294,231,301,269,279,89,132,135,52,106,291,15,124,167,104,26","119,17,181,54,43","1, 3, 9, 12, 15, 18, 25, 28, 32, 36, 39, 42, 47, 48, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 160, 163, 166, 169, 172, 175, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193"
188,He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.,"Jack had always been an adrenaline junkie, pursuing activities that pushed him to his limits. His adventurous spirit and fearless nature led him to take on one of his most dangerous pursuits yet - rock climbing on the infamous, perilous 'Killer Cliffs'. The cliffs, notorious for their jagged rocks, unpredictable weather, and near vertical drops, were a challenge that only the bravest of climbers dared to take on.

Jack prepared for months, both physically and mentally, pushing his endurance and concentration to new levels. As he began his ascent on the day of the climb, the sun was shining brightly, adding an air of optimism to the risky endeavor. The initial few hours were smooth, with Jack making steady progress and managing to overcome the challenges posed by the cliff's tricky terrain.

However, as he approached the edge of the cliff, the weather took a sudden turn. Clouds darkened the sky and a chilling wind started blowing, making the rocks slippery and the conditions treacherous. A sense of panic washed over him, but he managed to retain his focus and continued his ascent, moving inch by inch towards the top. 

Suddenly, Jack's worst fear came true. His foot slipped on a patch of loose rock and moss, causing him to lose his footing. His heart pounded in his chest as he felt himself being thrown off balance at the edge of the cliff, the ground disappearing beneath his feet. A scream of terror escaped his lips, echoing across the vast expanse.

But his training and instinct kicked in. Just as he was about to plummet down the cliff, his hand shot out, gripping tightly onto the rock protruding at the edge. His body swung in the air, dangling precariously, but his grip on the rock was firm.

His mind raced as he tried to think of what to do next. Fear gave way to a burning determination to survive. With a tremendous exertion of strength, he managed to pull himself up slowly, his muscles screaming in protest. 

The ordeal seemed to last an eternity, but he finally made it back to the edge of the cliff, laying exhausted and relieved on the rough surface. A feeling of disbelief swept over him as he realized he had narrowly escaped certain death. As he lay there, panting heavily, the sun came out from behind the clouds, warming his cold, tired body.

Saved just in time, Jack breathed a sigh of relief. His close call was a stark reminder of the dangers of his pursuits, making him reevaluate his fearless approach. Though shaken, he was grateful for his survival and vowed to be more cautious in his future adventures, etching the memory of his narrow escape deep into his adventurous spirit.","287,76,25,131,183,162,239,173,33,270,290,176,208,143,308,184,47,59,104,288,58,54,75,180,215,101,302,202,147,55,138,298,314,27,228,0,230,150,252,292,182,334,204,82,6,128,323,267,197,277,97,99,330,260,137,53,95,333,94,229,8,237,192,9,190,262,41,313,31,149,64,51,326,92,299,4,171,49,34,186,332,289,214,89,26,43,87,132,52,175,198,181,14,286,274,36,303,166,291,191,91,273,227,1,125,272,114,154,93,319,234,18,63,117,78,10,189,88,42,248,209,39,216,194,337,305,195,21,212,66,220,259,144,301,160,187,109,13,80,35,48,67,251,74,37,140,242,309,250,50,122,157,81,30,210,146,304,255,129,233,322,100,57,185,320,61,213,62,130,244,223,40,139,20,265,207,168,65,328,16,226,264,178,133,24,257,159,112,148,266,3,245,282,158,44,318,254,134,203,145","16,164,80,136,117","1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
189,Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.,"Sunday night was electric as the Philadelphia Eagles took on the Dallas Cowboys, their time-honored rivals, in a riveting football game. The atmosphere was tense, palpable with anticipation and the spirit of competition. The stands were filled with fans from both teams, their cheers echoing through the cold night air.

Philly, known for their aggressive defense and skillful offense, had been in top form throughout the season. Their unbroken string of victories had fans feeling optimistic and their rivals feeling the heat. The Cowboys, however, were not to be underestimated. This was a team that had its fair share of comebacks and thrilling victories. 

The game kicked off under the bright stadium lights, and from the first whistle, it was evident that neither team was going to make it easy for the other. The Cowboys’ offense stormed the field with a power play, catching Philly off guard. The first quarter saw the Cowboys take an early lead, and the Eagles scramble to recover.

Despite the initial shock, Philly quickly regained their momentum. Their defensive line, lauded as their strongest asset, held firm against the Cowboys’ relentless onslaught. As the second quarter rolled in, the Eagles started to close the gap. 

With each passing minute, the tension ratcheted up a notch. Every point scored was fiercely contested, and each play seemed to carry the weight of the entire game. The third quarter ended in a draw, with both teams locked in a stalemate, the score levelled at a nerve-wracking 20-20.

The final quarter was a show of grit and determination from both sides. The Cowboys, realizing they were on the verge of losing their lead, amped up their offensive game. They came dangerously close to scoring a touchdown, but a fantastic tackle from Philly's linebacker averted what could have been a game-changing score.

Philly, riding the wave of that momentum shift, retaliated with a brilliant offensive move. Their star quarterback expertly manoeuvred the ball down the field, and with a swift pass, gave the Eagles a crucial touchdown. The crowd roared as Philly took a slender lead with only a few minutes remaining on the clock.

Dallas, however, refused to go down without a fight. They pushed for a final offensive, but time was against them. As the final whistle blew, Philly emerged victorious, but by the skin of their teeth.

Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory. Yet it was the Eagles' determination and resilience in the face of adversity that led them to victory that night. And as the fans rejoiced, they knew they had witnessed a game that would be talked about for years to come. It was a game that perfectly embodied the spirit of sportsmanship and the thrill of football.","310,227,185,315,30,200,160,306,55,42,181,50,85,81,11,113,323,121,237,18,295,102,313,172,63,51,69,45,297,116,202,312,167,136,53,80,339,148,232,330,291,276,316,334,60,115,73,302,279,38,23,332,240,78,177,94,143,327,4,245,233,215,271,57,141,6,335,247,86,290,216,32,14,133,262,180,137,7,87,169,120,124,61,239,49,176,142,270,277,8,91,318,139,244,307,54,56,111,336,292,71,234,9,191,209,12,35,129,241,170,130,17,201,278,93,186,253,254,294,166,105,222,140,293,138,145,46,228,165,67,287,204,267,249,248,268,257,75,243,308,114,175,325,223,44,197,62,324,155,146,40,301,10,150,164,281,192,286,74,213,29,174,27,236,188,144,134,299,95,266,5,184,311,117,269,157,52,305,103,135,333,238,156,303,187,33,79,123,149,250,96,158,338,319,273,225,151,282,289,28","172,3,116,185,165","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
190,"Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.","Listen, I've often heard people say that losing weight is easier said than done, an assertion based on the reality that many people lack the commitment it requires. Let me share a story about my friend, Maria, which will hopefully lend some truth to this matter.

Maria was an incredibly lively and vibrant woman in her early thirties. She loved to travel, meet new people, and indulge in local cuisines, but her excessive weight gain was becoming a growing concern. She found it increasingly hard to do the things she loved without feeling tired, breathless, and uncomfortable.

One day, she decided it was time to take her health seriously. She pledged to start eating healthier and exercising daily. She shared her decision with her friends and family, who promised their unwavering support. There was a sense of determination in her eyes that made everyone believe that she was going to succeed. 

However, as weeks went by, her initial motivation started to fizzle out. She began skipping her workouts, justified eating unhealthy foods as 'cheat meals,' and soon started disregarding her diet plan altogether. Her family and friends tried to encourage her, but it was evident that Maria was losing the commitment she once showed.

Every time someone would remind her of her weight loss goal, she'd quickly respond with the phrase, ""losing weight is easier said than done."" It was clear that Maria had let her routine responsibilities, her love for food, and lack of perseverance get the best of her. She kept putting off her health for tomorrow, neglecting the fact that tomorrow never comes.

One could say that Maria's lack of commitment was not an exception. Many people give up too soon in their weight loss journey due to similar reasons. Losing weight requires hard work, consistency, discipline, and more importantly, resilience. 

Sure, losing weight is not easy, but it is not impossible either. It requires more than just words and a plan; it needs unyielding commitment. Maria's story is a reminder that the determination to lose weight should not just be a moment of enthusiasm but a sustained daily effort. 

This is not a tale to discourage but a call to action to understand that it's okay to struggle in the process of losing weight. The key is never to give up and to keep the commitment alive. Remember, as the saying goes, ""losing weight is easier said than done."" But let this not be an excuse, but rather a motivation to prove it wrong.","294,177,290,288,282,202,32,64,34,51,98,160,176,327,234,143,42,11,183,110,221,48,62,15,301,222,73,159,7,198,193,217,152,8,212,92,300,150,316,179,118,27,149,101,182,136,85,265,31,20,318,30,267,321,205,219,141,289,82,104,134,293,109,44,223,197,22,84,59,269,224,218,50,39,235,229,95,12,279,261,0,151,66,69,68,6,231,286,155,208,144,89,245,320,244,306,117,200,167,189,324,122,227,107,307,259,213,111,258,2,302,99,116,201,5,121,216,55,137,287,58,272,49,281,207,260,266,195,187,262,133,102,233,72,228,46,252,24,278,230,19,240,312,314,108,178,308,241,125,40,93,124,254,139,38,54,120,275,156,115,325,61,70,106,337,23,257,255,220,249,154,239,283,263,147,309,276,90,206,238,80,334,130,185,285,284,113,37,21,191,317,164,333,211,17,194,158,29,192,13","190,199,31,196,128","1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
191,It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.,"Bob looked out of his apartment window and into the busy New York city streets below. He sighed deeply as he watched the overwhelming traffic, thinking about how easy it must be to just sit in a car and drive. The streets were jam-packed with honking taxis, impatient drivers, and daring pedestrians trying to slip through the bustle. Every time he looked, it seemed simple; all you had to do was get in, start the engine, and follow the flow. But he knew all too well that reality was often not that simple.

Years ago, he had made the mistake of underestimating the city's infamous traffic. Right after getting his driver's license, he'd ambitiously decided to hit the road. All seemed fine until he found himself caught in a gridlock. Cars seemed to come from everywhere, buses swooshed past him unnervingly close, motorcyclists weaved dangerously in and out of the lanes, and pedestrians crossed the road at their leisure. The cacophony of horns and the occasional curse shouted out the window added to his terror. His heart had pounded like a drum in his chest as he clung desperately to the steering wheel.

His misconception shattered within minutes. Driving wasn't just about knowing how to operate a car; it was about reading the road, understanding the rhythm of the traffic, being prepared for the unpredictable. The city required a certain level of skill and alertness. Only experienced drivers could navigate through this chaos; rookies like him were out of their depth.

This realization hit him hard as he found himself frozen in the labyrinth of vehicles. Every honk seemed to mock his inexperience. He had ended up causing a minor accident, leading to a traffic jam and angry drivers all around. The humiliation had been too much, and that had been the end of his short-lived driving career.

Years later, Bob still watched the traffic from his apartment, the memory of his debacle as fresh as ever. The naive illusion of simplicity had faded; he now knew the truth. It looked easy but it was very hard to drive a car in this traffic.

Despite his embarrassing memory, Bob knew he would have to face his fears sooner or later. The city demanded it. He knew he had to become one of those experienced drivers navigating effortlessly through the bustling traffic. But until then, he would watch from his window, studying the rhythm, the chaos, the impromptu dance of the city traffic, dreaming of the day he could join the fray with confidence and skill.","71,38,289,229,332,29,254,176,118,178,97,75,20,101,253,162,337,312,291,199,30,41,226,125,309,34,81,231,308,279,103,311,98,193,100,69,339,286,96,108,165,159,154,157,237,148,126,152,68,8,184,14,26,259,53,306,290,181,95,85,136,142,331,61,260,302,258,251,249,173,52,211,168,328,276,175,196,230,225,314,243,166,115,183,257,318,287,74,241,195,4,130,200,189,256,224,264,206,267,201,23,170,67,336,7,215,147,133,32,93,62,198,283,296,234,238,45,186,202,190,179,113,172,240,138,50,60,182,94,24,36,79,219,88,298,63,217,66,46,325,293,18,274,171,141,64,127,107,137,27,11,91,21,57,292,2,161,49,297,307,86,177,139,153,58,112,333,124,317,160,327,205,78,204,280,89,207,222,192,236,321,128,255,232,5,320,25,216,72,145,121,37,194,269,266,246,330,48,156,244","120,179,34,193,90","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
192,"It takes a lot of effort to write a novel, so do not think writers do nothing worthy.","Many people believe that writing a novel is a simple task; they often underestimate the amount of work and dedication it takes. They assume that writers have an easy job, claiming that all they do is jot down a couple of words and phrases. Yet, this couldn't be further from the truth. Writing a novel is like building a castle, brick by brick, each word a cornerstone of the grand masterpiece. It's not something that should be disregarded or underestimated.

Every novelist starts with a blank page, a cursor blinking mockingly in the vast white space. It takes courage to make the first mark, to pour out your thoughts, ideas, and emotions into words. Then comes the daunting task of sculpting those rough, raw words into coherent and compelling sentences. Each sentence should hook the reader, keeping them on the edge of their seat, unable to put down the book.

The plot is another mammoth task that requires considerable creativity and ingenuity. It’s like a puzzle, pieces need to be arranged in a particular order for the story to make sense. Characters need to be crafted meticulously, each with their own personality, history, and goals. They need to be so vivid and compelling that the readers can relate to them and their struggles. 

The setting, too, demands attention. Every minute detail needs to be considered - from the weather and the season to the ambiance and the aroma. It should be so immersive that the reader feels like they're right there in the heart of the story.

After writing comes the process of revising. Every single word and punctuation needs to be scrutinized. Typos need to be hunted down mercilessly, sentences need to be tweaked and refined, plot holes need to be filled and pacing needs to be adjusted. 

Additionally, writers need to deal with constant self-doubt and criticism. The nagging feeling of 'not good enough' is their constant companion. They need to have the strength to face rejection and criticism, for a writer's work is subjected to the world's judgment.

Above all, a writer has to stay dedicated, disciplined, and motivated. It can take years to complete a novel, through sleepless nights and countless cups of coffee. It requires a great deal of resilience and tenacity.

So, the next time you think that writers do nothing worthy, remember the amount of effort it takes to write a novel. It's a process filled with sweat, tears, and countless moments of joy and despair. It's a journey that requires strength, perseverance, and above all, a burning passion for storytelling. It may seem like an arduous task to many, but to a writer, it’s a labor of love, a beautiful madness they willingly indulge in. After all, every word penned is a piece of the writer's soul, etched forever in the annals of literature.","251,262,179,138,240,167,237,91,309,86,271,22,225,281,16,68,232,128,121,43,118,292,206,313,93,222,284,89,280,80,66,20,295,323,33,111,61,255,9,258,216,267,65,238,250,190,228,331,339,277,199,97,28,218,299,59,154,72,60,81,124,322,227,75,306,289,305,19,176,169,197,134,34,279,259,226,136,224,123,182,338,112,57,143,54,131,102,108,105,209,142,158,301,310,1,241,73,79,247,275,85,148,230,161,51,149,174,315,130,317,278,31,168,193,257,64,201,44,336,242,99,116,70,52,211,276,191,319,183,235,266,140,74,324,270,114,223,205,151,67,125,194,15,23,261,293,137,29,40,155,184,291,195,11,307,273,42,245,217,178,196,268,27,177,7,173,71,308,229,10,188,94,312,135,297,186,202,14,24,252,165,244,110,330,160,164,311,302,260,0,145,298,84,212,13,38,314,18,208,163","46,127,114,142,153","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
193,Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.,"Victor was a well-rounded individual who worked diligently in all his tasks. He was hardworking, intelligent, but terribly ignorant when it came to matters of the arts. Victor often brushed off artistic professions as easy and worthless, especially when it came to acting. He thought that anyone can mimic emotions and lines which was not as complex as other professions. Yet, his perceptions began to change once he decided to join a theater class on a whim, and the journey that unfolded changed his view entirely.

It was a dreary afternoon when Victor found himself pushing open the doors to the university's auditorium for his first theater class. He carried himself with an air of arrogance, believing this to be a blow-off class he would ace without effort. But as he scanned the room, he saw something unexpected. The students were alive with passion and dedication, reciting monologues and reacting to critiques with an earnestness he had not expected. This sight caused Victor to halt in his tracks, beginning to sense an underlying profundity in the craft he hadn’t noticed before.

As the days turned into weeks, Victor found himself thoroughly engrossed in the world of acting. The group dynamics, the synergy needed to perform a play, the intensity of the expressions, and the subtle details of a performance were fascinating to him. He saw his peers pour their hearts and souls into creating believable characters and narratives, which made him question his previous assumptions.

Then came the day of his first performance. Heart pounding, palms sweating, Victor stepped onto the stage. The bright lights blinded him momentarily, and he strained to make out the sea of faces watching him expectantly. The realization then struck him: he was not merely pretending to be someone else. He was, for the span of the play, embodying another person's life, with all their complexities and subtleties.

Each line he delivered was not just a recitation of written text, but an exploration of the human psyche. The applause that echoed in his ears once the curtain fell felt like the sweetest music. The exhilaration, the satisfaction, and the applause were addicting, but so was the hardship, the strive for perfection and the constant effort to improve.

In that moment, Victor realized the enormous depth and significance of acting. The art was indeed demanding, exacting in its requirement for sincerity, creativity, and interpretation. He had been so wrong to think it was a profession anyone could master. It was a craft that required diligence, patience, and empathy. In his ignorance, he had failed to see the beauty and the strength it took to pour your soul out for an audience.

As he bowed for the last time that night, Victor felt a newfound respect for actors and the world of theater. Acting was not just a job, it was a lifestyle, an art form that only those with true passion and dedication could master. He was humbled, thrilled, and excited all at once - all because he took a chance on a theater class.","291,90,299,1,168,17,100,154,258,269,217,157,108,114,324,311,102,64,330,320,280,336,166,265,85,163,179,56,138,221,152,171,149,321,281,266,170,210,60,95,72,257,276,284,261,12,47,232,27,290,144,19,25,331,93,172,314,208,200,329,303,202,46,254,99,186,141,235,91,150,310,135,40,28,3,184,21,191,31,176,23,238,316,169,33,117,244,98,65,300,118,213,323,293,107,305,38,273,231,252,250,105,192,277,164,195,222,264,220,137,26,237,77,339,0,194,84,162,44,74,224,204,255,8,97,57,7,297,167,110,131,53,51,129,153,283,205,241,160,24,242,119,42,180,2,156,216,270,83,62,199,312,307,298,325,278,41,332,209,126,173,268,219,288,292,296,229,145,71,36,335,151,48,101,285,69,76,230,308,246,218,6,80,134,318,272,35,309,52,20,287,263,282,133,190,182,104,139,262,116","195,78,103,116,106","1, 4, 5, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 34, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
194,To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.,"Dora had been a solitary research scientist her entire career. Despite her advanced degrees in biotechnology, she had never faced a situation quite like this before. She had been tasked with teaching biotechnology to a class of students. Only ten of them, yet it was daunting.

The thought of standing before these eager young minds, all eyes fixated on her, made her nervous. She was terrified of making a fool of herself. She was worried that she might not be able to answer their questions satisfactorily. Moreover, she feared being unable to teach the complex subject in a simple, understandable manner.

To conquer her fears, Dora knew she needed to be thoroughly prepared. She began reading through numerous books and journals, refreshing her knowledge on the topic. She started drafting lecture notes, coming up with interactive lesson plans and practical demonstrations. It was a lot of hard work, but Dora knew it was worth it.

She worked late into the nights, making sure every lesson was comprehensive. She would jot down potential queries she thought the students might have, and seek answers for each. She poured her effort into ensuring that every topic was so well-explained that no student would find it difficult to comprehend.

Then, she decided to do mock presentations in front of her mirror to boost her confidence. It wasn't the same as facing the actual students, but it helped Dora work on her presentation skills. She perfected her body language, her speech tempo, and her expression to ensure she was perfectly understood.

She also spent time brainstorming on how to make the classes interactive and fun. She came up with the idea of conducting mini-projects, where students could practically apply what they learned. She was excited and a little nervous about how these would be received.

Finally, the day arrived when Dora had to face her first class. She woke up early, practiced her lecture one last time, and headed to the university. As she walked into the classroom, she saw ten curious faces staring back at her. This was it - her moment of truth.

She began her lecture, her voice shaking at first, but steadying as she started discussing the topic she was so passionate about. The students were attentive and responsive, which boosted her confidence immensely. Their insightful questions also made her happy that her preparation was proving to be effective.

Over time, Dora found that teaching wasn't as daunting as she had initially thought. The hard work and dedication she had put into her preparations did indeed pay off. She discovered a sense of satisfaction and joy in explaining ideas well, observing her students grasp complex concepts, and sharing her passion for biotechnology with them.

In retrospect, while teaching a class of even 10 students had seemed daunting for Dora as a first-timer, it had turned into an incredibly fulfilling experience. The dedication, effort and preparation she had put in, the ideas she had managed to explain well, were a testament to her commitment to her new role, inspiring her to become an even better educator in the future.","195,138,11,252,47,240,0,302,78,270,277,332,275,290,232,43,224,111,59,164,148,134,146,6,321,264,225,254,100,227,271,92,18,244,5,214,291,55,34,13,38,339,151,246,304,184,300,163,10,335,333,219,86,177,70,206,9,68,161,234,80,260,325,222,228,137,154,19,104,272,282,20,32,126,192,147,307,49,48,131,142,157,21,289,262,323,166,51,211,84,61,73,79,305,278,171,129,279,58,52,93,17,31,120,283,106,189,162,241,107,35,127,45,237,316,182,238,258,266,251,175,226,284,88,160,150,203,220,324,143,130,74,89,191,140,122,53,281,114,72,310,87,136,223,96,235,263,103,334,64,197,245,178,22,183,69,66,187,242,319,198,101,37,329,218,15,75,229,209,128,109,297,274,212,298,176,108,167,338,156,25,185,46,249,174,65,30,24,216,190,256,257,239,287,318,54,193,90,201,250","190,134,75,197,1","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
195,It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.,"Ever since I was a child, my dream was to get into the most prestigious university in the country. It was known for its rigorous academic standards and competitive entrance exams. To clear this exam, it required a tremendous amount of focus and discipline, something I was determined to develop. It wasn't a task everyone could accomplish, but I was resolute. 

I began planning early, mapping out my subjects and timetable for the challenging year ahead. The daunting task was dissecting the entrance exam; it was a monstrous mix of analytical thinking, problem-solving, and extensive subject knowledge. I knew that studying traditionally wasn't going to cut it.

To successfully navigate the challenge, I decided to implement a strategic approach. I meticulously analyzed previous exam papers to identify trends, topics that were consistently tested and the ones that were occasionally featured. I realized that the exam was not just about rote learning; it tested the candidates' understanding, interpretation, and application of knowledge.

My days were long, starting early in the morning and stretching well into the night. Many times I wanted to give up, feeling overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of the syllabus. But, I reminded myself of the end goal, the prestige of that university and the doors it could open for me.

Being disciplined was never my strong suit, but I needed to exercise an unprecedented level of control over my study habits, diet, sleep schedule, and even social life to realize my dream. I refused to let my focus waver, keeping my eyes on the prize. 

Every time I felt my commitment wane, I visualized myself walking through the university's hallowed halls, a sense of accomplishment swelling within me. This mental image acted as a source of inspiration, a testament to my capability and potential, and it helped me get back on track.

As the exam date drew nearer, the pressure began to mount. There were sleepless nights, teary eyes, and moments of self-doubt. However, with every question, every chapter, I conquered, I was a step closer to my goal.

After a long year of hard work, the day finally arrived. I still remember the acute nervousness that plagued me as I sat down to take the exam. Even though I was confident, the enormity of the situation was hard to ignore.

In the end, it all paid off. My name was there on the list, an affirmation of my hard work, focus, and discipline. It was a testament that I had cleared the entrance exam to the prestigious university.

Overwhelmed with happiness and relief, I knew that not everyone could have accomplished what I did. It was not just about clearing an exam; it was about proving to myself that with determination, perseverance, and discipline, I could achieve my dreams. 

Looking back, I realize the struggle was worth it. The focus and discipline it required to clear the entrance exam have become an intrinsic part of me, shaping me into a stronger, more determined individual, capable of facing any challenge that comes my way.","151,44,198,252,131,213,278,181,85,281,204,92,22,40,71,274,306,141,323,27,149,34,320,292,6,134,104,191,118,83,156,48,72,237,178,266,212,39,93,168,268,330,304,80,273,180,282,161,263,8,57,332,339,112,277,221,35,310,220,336,236,143,311,19,59,211,53,222,132,288,163,190,2,78,192,125,145,264,66,29,64,0,169,52,12,201,283,217,127,214,325,15,124,315,238,175,73,294,262,162,171,79,228,96,51,186,267,148,265,317,26,31,209,259,328,197,166,241,9,285,243,272,111,30,91,42,216,261,179,184,144,270,36,77,249,313,302,33,239,230,297,218,229,177,257,49,280,76,187,110,137,251,68,90,115,225,126,321,142,121,271,75,41,1,215,269,135,208,314,255,206,284,165,253,87,24,159,172,293,97,194,100,203,234,286,329,43,55,202,164,333,337,130,193,86,276,250,254,84,61","72,28,75,194,181","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
196,"I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.","I've always been a cautious person, wary of risks and adventures. I prefer to play it safe, keeping my feet firmly on the ground, both metaphorically and literally. A typical day for me is filled with peace and predictability, and that's just how I like it. But there's always been one thought that managed to challenge my commitment to my comfortable life - skydiving. The mere thought of throwing myself out of a plane, thousands of feet above the ground, absolutely terrifies me.

The idea of skydiving has long been an item on my mental list of things I'll probably never do. It's a concept that has always felt foreign and frightening, something best left to daredevils and adrenaline junkies. When I imagine the sensation of freefall, the chilling wind cutting across my face as I plummet towards the earth, my heart begins to race. 

I picture the panoramic view of the world below, with its patchwork of fields and forests, rivers and towns, a sight so surreal that it might as well be a painting. I imagine the adrenaline rush, the terrifying thrill that would be unlike anything I've ever experienced. I see myself gripping the straps of my parachute harness, my knuckles white from the intensity of my terror.

Despite my fear, the idea keeps coming back to me, a persistent itch at the back of my mind. After all, how many people can say they've literally jumped out of a plane and lived to tell the tale? There's something so alluring about stepping out of my comfort zone and pushing the boundaries of what I'm capable of.

Recently, I've begun to seriously consider it, and the more I think about it, the more it sounds like a challenge rather than a fear. It's an adventure, an opportunity to face my fears head-on. It's a chance to experience something extraordinary, something that most people only dream of.

I have realized that I don't want my life to be just safe and predictable. I want to add some thrill, some excitement, something that makes my heart pound in my chest. 

I am absolutely terrified of skydiving. The very thought sends shivers down my spine. But the more I consider it, the more the fear is mixed with anticipation. Once in my life, I've decided, I will give it a whirl. I'll buckle myself in, board that plane, and take the leap of faith.

Who knows? Maybe it'll be the best decision I've ever made. Maybe it'll turn out to be the thrill of a lifetime, an exhilarating escape from the mundane, and a tale to tell for the rest of my life. Maybe, just maybe, I will learn to love the thrill just as much as I currently fear it.","109,111,81,198,250,107,305,58,218,101,94,310,28,337,314,221,38,61,45,97,209,33,312,174,214,199,54,6,115,55,120,7,102,163,294,207,35,131,145,330,334,119,130,208,201,166,121,178,229,252,152,226,272,278,2,89,233,37,65,50,20,228,224,279,48,286,159,213,118,274,117,300,285,8,325,34,85,60,273,339,313,44,188,165,24,132,235,40,195,297,22,251,302,336,53,80,255,12,176,177,265,277,46,211,254,216,306,110,41,238,162,308,5,261,168,11,103,173,124,298,203,230,69,156,295,245,187,186,244,170,143,193,288,142,321,283,136,206,57,106,184,309,86,284,292,320,247,108,318,200,66,83,194,223,335,125,149,171,270,9,88,43,197,84,271,267,234,253,36,77,268,282,82,225,100,92,96,17,317,157,75,210,231,95,114,18,90,148,215,153,179,290,72,212,39,70,260,262,27,151","163,4,26,150,45","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
197,I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.,"Ever since I was a child, I've had an irrational fear of walking on the streets at night. The mere idea of the hidden dangers lurking in the shadows made my heart race uncontrollably. Each sound morphed into something scary in my imagination. A rustling leaf would suddenly be a hidden attacker, a breeze would carry whispers of warnings. I would shudder at the mere thought of it, feeling an inexplicable dread wash over me.

I knew it was a baseless fear, yet I could not help but succumb to it. My parents often tried to tell me that the world isn't as terrifying as I had painted it in my mind. Yet their words never seemed to remove the cloak of fear that I had wrapped myself in. I felt embarrassed and vulnerable, well aware that my fear was unusual, and didn't make sense.

As I grew older, I knew I would have to face this fear one day. Life has a way of pushing you into situations you often want to avoid. And as fate would have it, the day arrived sooner than I had anticipated. Due to my job, I had to move to a city away from my family and start living alone.

Moving out was a big step for me. Not only was I leaving the comfort and security of my home, but I was also embarking on a journey to face my fears head-on. I would no longer have the safety net of my parents and would have to rely on myself. I knew then that I would have to confront my childhood terror of walking alone on the streets at night.

I tried to avoid it for the first few days. I always ensured that I was home before it got dark. But it wasn't feasible in the long run, considering my work schedules and the unpredictable nature of life. I realized that I was letting my irrational fear control my life, and this needed to change.

The thought of walking the streets at night scared me, but I also knew that it was a fear I had to conquer. One day, I found the courage to face it. I remember clearly, it was a quiet evening. The city was humming with its usual buzz. I took a deep breath, gathered my courage, and stepped out onto the street.

The shadows seemed to dance around me as I walked. The breeze carried whispers that once terrified me, but I reminded myself that they were just figments of my imagination. With each step I took, I could feel a part of my fear melting away.

The fear that had haunted me for so many years, the fear of walking alone on the streets at night, seemed to lose its intensity that day. I knew there were many such walks in my future and I would have to face them alone. I was no longer a child living in constant fear, but a grown woman learning to face her fears. I knew I would eventually do it one day, and that day had finally arrived.","335,225,215,59,154,53,107,65,99,130,117,230,159,262,84,114,339,13,224,41,39,70,203,24,252,60,8,3,293,303,328,29,45,190,273,279,58,186,139,38,287,112,35,201,305,61,182,172,267,266,18,257,307,221,237,168,211,1,158,319,274,170,210,198,103,283,63,138,302,120,294,40,240,167,176,217,151,313,20,309,113,36,295,4,129,251,196,23,135,80,245,304,246,244,333,264,76,30,199,33,161,95,124,7,100,291,155,184,171,78,67,258,148,265,286,132,222,239,214,89,87,261,289,121,281,299,134,26,90,178,141,69,37,193,173,9,125,276,163,115,183,110,143,205,226,234,64,242,91,194,133,34,269,82,46,44,52,285,25,136,153,85,109,208,11,212,79,105,200,50,174,314,300,322,284,118,272,253,301,296,248,334,337,77,219,250,254,83,188,195,331,16,290,150,325,231,51,327,235,49","87,64,99,169,44","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22"
198,Sam is scared of speaking to strangers but she wants to build up the courage and try it out.,"Sam had always been a shy, introverted person. Ever since she was a little girl, she had a deep-seated fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of striking up a conversation with someone she didn't know left her feeling nauseous. The unknown responses and the unpredictability of the situation terrified her. Sam yearned to step out of her comfort zone, but the fear held her back.

Over time, this fear became a constraint, even an obstacle in her life. From avoiding public speaking events to running away from networking opportunities, her fear of strangers made her miss out on so much. She saw her friends engage with new people easily, making friends, and expanding their horizons. That made her feel even worse about her social anxiety.

One day, she decided that enough was enough. She was tired of her fear of strangers dominating her life. Sam decided to take control and confront her fear. She wanted to build up the courage to talk to strangers. It wasn't going to be easy, but she knew she needed to do it.

She started off by setting small goals for herself. She made it a point to say 'hello' to one new person every day. At first, she stumbled and stuttered, but she was proud of herself for trying. After achieving this goal for a month, she challenged herself further. She aimed to strike up a conversation with a stranger once a week.

Day after day, week after week, Sam worked hard to overcome her fear. She started attending social events, pushing herself to initiate conversations, and meeting new people. She even enrolled in public speaking workshops. 

As time passed, Sam noticed that the pit in her stomach began to subside, her stuttering lessened, and she started to feel more comfortable speaking to strangers. Each small step was a victory that filled her with courage.

Today, Sam is a different person. She is not just a woman who overcame her fear of speaking to strangers, but also a woman who found her voice in the process. She discovered that the fear she was harboring was more about self-judgment than it was about strangers.

Overcoming this fear wasn't easy, and there were many times Sam thought of giving up. But she stuck through it and came out stronger and more confident on the other side. This experience taught her a valuable lesson: that courage isn't the absence of fear, but the decision to face it head-on. 

Her journey wasn't just about speaking to strangers. It was a journey of self-improvement, self-discovery, and most importantly, self-belief. 

And that's the story of Sam: a woman who was scared of speaking to strangers, but who chose courage over fear, and transformed her life.","221,26,5,82,290,73,171,197,278,302,117,97,238,209,224,135,126,291,99,214,118,42,12,56,94,226,148,166,33,64,23,227,95,27,253,332,265,191,331,70,180,157,337,150,2,44,142,65,43,194,4,286,32,305,196,19,300,212,54,173,248,280,106,74,304,175,308,257,246,266,156,13,185,115,327,154,322,41,315,241,113,60,131,225,58,145,46,199,72,298,144,189,101,136,276,301,24,91,206,187,289,160,207,314,264,181,326,88,8,16,268,321,211,114,71,15,328,200,239,307,213,260,287,39,125,147,333,247,132,231,69,1,139,68,188,292,284,324,336,124,256,14,205,67,159,22,28,273,37,51,297,329,312,269,228,283,232,258,110,76,237,81,202,138,61,161,111,130,254,30,40,102,18,204,10,244,164,318,133,299,201,170,335,183,93,259,319,153,34,162,109,251,80,104,143,285,63,309,108,62","55,8,88,118,181","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
199,"Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.","Frank has always been a bit of a traditionalist. He valued the simplicity of life before the rise of technology, finding solace in the pages of books rather than the pixels of screens. He saw computers as intimidating, complex machines, capable of tremendous potential, yet ultimately foreign. Despite living in the digital age, Frank had never made an attempt to write a computer program. He found the intricacies of coding languages beyond his grasp, and the thought of pouring over lines of seemingly cryptic text was enough to make him recoil.

Then, last time we met, Frank surprised me with an unexpected declaration. I remember that afternoon distinctly. We had met at our favourite café, nestled in the heart of our hometown. Its vintage charm and calming ambiance had always been our solace away from the hustle and bustle of life. As we settled into our usual seats and the familiar aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air, Frank dropped the bombshell.

""I'm going to do it. I'm going to learn programming,"" he announced, a determination burning in his eyes.

I was taken aback, disbelief washing over me. I asked him if he was serious. Frank, always the joker, liked to say outrageous things to get a reaction, but this seemed different. His usual light-heartedness was replaced with a seriousness I hadn't seen in him before.

""Yes, I am. I've been thinking about it and I don't want to be left behind. It's high time I faced this fear,"" he confessed.

From that day forward, Frank showed a commitment to his goal that I hadn't seen from him before. He purchased programming books, subscribed to various online courses, and spent countless hours watching tutorials on YouTube. The man who had once found computers daunting now began to engage with them daily.

At times, it was hard for him. There were nights when he would call, frustrated and ready to quit. I would always remind him of the determined look in his eyes at the café, urging him to keep going. 

Gradually, Frank began to grasp the languages of coding. The gibberish text started making sense, and he slowly developed an understanding of the logic behind it. For a man who had never tried to write a computer program before, his progress was astounding.

And so, Frank's journey from a man repelled by technology to one who could write a computer program began. It was a testament to his determination and a living proof that it was never too late to learn. It took a lot of courage for him to step out of his comfort zone and embrace the challenge. I felt incredibly proud of him. He had taken on what he had once seen as daunting and emerged triumphant. It was a feat truly worth celebrating.","166,57,178,55,198,223,153,263,229,120,137,284,324,304,4,32,29,174,76,73,309,287,267,209,98,106,9,59,246,185,42,331,44,319,146,213,179,66,176,128,291,328,109,256,130,188,334,313,24,295,290,96,196,170,46,107,194,131,132,318,222,108,272,260,133,310,162,189,51,175,69,64,207,77,184,212,236,235,67,160,54,312,247,92,283,220,47,259,271,110,224,13,45,43,113,3,16,215,86,323,155,180,126,320,52,7,252,327,149,168,219,71,237,72,183,316,1,239,329,123,264,165,53,91,302,90,230,40,84,19,251,100,31,301,20,58,173,63,68,307,61,41,276,135,125,27,191,280,152,139,206,18,129,10,48,281,8,35,124,286,22,201,34,159,60,14,216,81,245,195,317,238,242,244,2,158,102,15,262,177,200,253,275,181,56,104,80,226,88,278,197,122,50,325,134,150,39,228,211,167","53,191,5,181,162","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
200,"My sister cannot sleep in a dark room due to her fears, but she wants to challenge herself someday.","My sister Mary has always had a peculiar fear, one which some would find common, yet others completely bizarre. She has been plagued by an intense fear of the dark. It's not merely a discomfort or a slight fear, but a deep-rooted phobia that grasps her like icy hands around her throat. This makes even the simplest of tasks like falling asleep a nightmare for her. Hence, she has always slept with the lights fully turned on.

Being the more rational older sibling, I tried many times to rationalize her fears away. I would explain the science behind darkness, which is merely the absence of light, that there are no lurking monsters or specters. But her fear was so irrational, so primal, it was beyond the reach of logical reasoning.

Our parents initially dismissed her fear as a childish whim. They figured it was something she would grow out of once she became older. But instead, her fear only seemed to intensify. Soon, they recognized it was something beyond her control, a legitimate fear that gripped her.

Due to her extreme fear, our utility bills were always higher than average. Our home was like a beacon in our little neighborhood, glowing throughout the night. This was a small price to pay for my sister’s peace of mind.

All through her teenage years, Mary carried this fear. She was a great sport about it, taking all the sibling teasing and friend’s jokes with a brave smile. But I could see how it gnawed at her, the weirdness of being unable to sleep in the dark.

Mary was always a strong-willed person. I admired her for being bold about her fears. She never shied away from her problems. One day, after graduating high school, she told me she decided to take a bold step. She announced her decision to challenge her fears. She planned on teaching herself to sleep in the dark.

I was initially skeptical about this abrupt decision. But the determination in her eyes spoke volumes. She admitted it was not going to be easy. She understood she might be terrified, she might not sleep for days, but she was resolute.

Mary started small. She began by dimming the lights in her room each night. Then, she moved to using night lights. Slowly, she transitioned to the soft glow of fairy lights. The process was gradual but she was firm on her decision.

The first few nights were challenging. I could often hear her awake till dawn, tossing and turning restlessly. But she never gave up. With each passing night, she inched a step closer to her goal.

One fine day, to our absolute surprise, Mary slept the whole night with just a small nightlight. It was a victory, a moment of triumph for her. It felt like she had climbed Mount Everest.

Eventually, Mary learned to sleep in complete darkness. It wasn't easy, and it required courage and determination. But she did it. She proved to herself and to all of us that fears are merely obstacles. And with the right determination and spirit, any obstacle can be overcome.","240,308,291,274,309,46,271,2,305,116,166,230,54,143,189,318,123,66,328,23,329,270,253,267,211,192,175,228,244,90,93,210,70,207,281,19,180,227,32,176,6,94,311,139,215,86,35,277,272,45,155,286,41,0,273,217,138,60,226,84,278,78,16,145,81,61,48,15,164,248,51,170,136,39,68,40,106,18,288,307,5,168,174,335,115,71,142,134,198,205,74,67,69,191,4,219,190,119,102,104,37,112,82,304,89,156,140,144,213,108,172,303,187,237,12,55,324,188,298,212,283,8,231,44,120,38,316,252,266,268,331,196,118,249,97,275,149,129,20,320,130,183,33,263,294,50,21,290,337,62,223,336,58,246,53,65,201,121,186,182,284,117,302,80,133,202,122,247,25,330,333,306,280,197,229,131,279,43,184,258,109,127,179,199,239,321,147,323,285,225,125,7,26,141,287,124,14,157,107,11","132,174,89,184,157","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
201,"Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.","Sally had always been a bit of a couch potato. Her routine had always centered around her work, her books, and the occasional movie night out with her friends. Her diet was not terrible, but it wasn't great either. But when it came to physical activity, Sally always kept a safe distance, especially from places like the gym. It wasn't that she was averse to physical exercise per se, it was the thought of lifting weights that scared her.

She found the sight of barbells and dumbbells intimidating. The idea of pumping iron, straining her muscles and sweating profusely seemed torturous, and not to mention the fear of pulling a muscle or spraining an ankle. But what worried her most was the thought of being the newbie at the gym, struggling with the weights while everyone else effortlessly lifted theirs. And so, Sally had never been to the gym.

However, of late, things started to change. Sally began to think more about her health. She could no longer ignore the breathlessness that followed climbing a flight of stairs, or the aching joints that were becoming more frequent. She found herself standing in front of the mirror, wondering when she had started looking so tired and out of shape. 

Her best friend, Linda, was a fitness enthusiast who had often suggested Sally to try going to the gym. One day, Linda invited Sally to a small get together at her place. She introduced Sally to several of her gym buddies, some of whom had amazing transformation stories to share. 

Sally was moved by a woman named Hannah who had battled obesity and depression, eventually regaining control of her life by embracing fitness. Hannah was not an athlete or bodybuilder, but a regular woman like Sally who had used weightlifting as a tool to uplift her body and spirit.

Something about Hannah's story resonated with Sally, and for the first time, she considered that the gym might not be as terrifying as she had imagined. Emboldened, Sally finally shared her fears about lifting weights with Linda. Linda reassured her that everyone starts somewhere and that the gym community is more supportive than she thought. 

In the days that followed, Sally found herself showing a keen interest in fitness. She started researching and learning more about the benefits of lifting weights for women. She slowly came to understand that with proper guidance and training, she could safely engage in weightlifting.

After much thought, Sally made a decision. She told her friends that she had decided to conquer her fears and join the gym. Linda was thrilled and promised to accompany her for the initial days. Sally was nervous but excited. She knew it wasn't going to be easy, but she was determined to push herself out of her comfort zone and embark on this new journey towards a healthier lifestyle.","155,142,147,117,95,97,121,83,151,94,268,37,162,7,198,179,176,338,202,79,61,15,12,169,160,219,303,158,90,139,164,295,157,76,175,227,301,131,196,270,57,50,197,165,260,253,2,136,36,65,70,34,261,35,20,174,243,185,319,56,213,251,23,259,312,42,181,62,107,328,178,306,193,305,71,24,143,228,234,38,166,247,264,100,280,290,232,69,215,132,221,13,187,140,126,308,314,39,331,26,145,86,3,207,302,284,6,41,28,210,231,54,206,265,63,172,324,336,281,33,153,91,241,105,27,192,256,278,10,249,8,286,262,335,66,293,237,115,75,163,313,255,129,154,114,188,238,225,304,296,271,14,141,77,254,239,272,297,275,277,242,289,16,53,49,64,323,177,19,220,233,309,285,330,209,276,334,130,218,5,282,73,30,298,119,88,194,32,223,200,144,183,217,199,123,148,311,22,216,190","39,43,15,194,190","1, 5, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
202,"When Chris turned forty, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job for his hobbies.","Chris worked an average desk job, stuck behind a computer from nine to five. His job was secure, mundane, and predictable, giving him a stable income but no excitement. When he was younger, he had dreams, dreams of being an artist, a photographer, a traveler. His life, however, had taken him down a much more traditional route. As years went by, his dreams were shelved and almost forgotten.

However, something in him stirred as he approached the age of forty. Life seemed too short to be lived in monotonous predictability. It was on his fortieth birthday, amid the balloons and presents, that Chris made a decision that shocked everyone.

He announced, ""I've decided to quit my job and pursue my hobbies full-time."" The room went silent as everyone absorbed the shocking news. After the initial surprise, his announcement was met with an uproar of questions and concern from his loved ones. Some were worried about his financial stability; others were questioning his sanity.

Despite the overwhelming skepticism, Chris was unperturbed. He had a vision and a plan. He had always been passionate about photography, painting, and travelling. Now, he was ready to turn these hobbies into his full-time job. 

The next day, Chris handed in his resignation letter. He packed up his cubicle, a space that he had occupied for almost two decades, and walked out of the office building with a sense of relief and freedom. He immediately converted his home study into an art studio where he could paint and edit his photography.

Next, he started planning his travels. He wanted to capture the essence of different cultures and experiences around the world through his photography. He began with a trip to Asia, exploring the bustling streets of Tokyo, the peaceful temples of Bali, and the vibrant markets of India.

As months turned into a year, Chris began exhibiting his art and photography. His unique perspective and captivating images caught the attention of various art enthusiasts and critics. His work was an instant success, getting featured in several renowned art magazines and exhibitions.

With every successful exhibition and sale, Chris felt a sense of contentment that he had never experienced before. He had never felt more alive and creative. He was grateful for having taken that risk on his fortieth birthday, leaving the predictable behind and choosing to live his life in the fast lane. 

Thus, when Chris turned forty, he chose to follow his dreams and live his life to the fullest. He quit his job and embraced his hobbies, proving that it’s never too late to follow one's passion. His transformation was a powerful reminder that life is too short to be spent doing anything but what truly brings happiness and satisfaction.","299,30,193,1,65,274,284,168,199,235,213,311,307,127,103,285,34,113,261,3,149,75,231,140,326,68,209,327,151,169,134,198,136,230,312,137,116,245,110,56,5,170,214,126,83,203,226,255,76,236,250,96,184,286,93,208,260,42,296,43,315,336,323,241,37,290,24,287,180,38,288,40,188,232,237,57,292,316,204,97,135,77,19,55,125,46,289,302,171,325,295,291,52,21,152,187,215,161,112,282,262,178,259,41,257,165,233,333,45,271,210,297,147,175,86,205,305,338,157,167,54,185,301,74,269,321,58,120,144,330,206,173,200,308,27,177,143,270,31,329,32,142,265,62,72,227,122,85,278,51,222,339,253,334,60,331,310,153,84,89,223,219,218,318,221,91,100,158,66,104,332,328,264,207,23,131,35,195,33,324,114,108,102,179,217,335,81,87,17,4,244,294,306,15,263,197,0,128,160,273","46,79,116,131,174","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
203,"After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.","After years of working tirelessly as a lawyer, Smith felt a profound emptiness. He'd spent endless nights pouring over case files, sipping at lukewarm coffee, and arguing points in front of juries. Success and failure hung in the balance with each case he took on. Despite his successful career, Smith was left feeling unfulfilled.

Smith's heart lay elsewhere. Ever since he was a child, he had a passion for music. He would sneak into his mother's lounge as a kid, put on an old Frank Sinatra vinyl and sing along with unbounded enthusiasm. As he grew older, he joined the high school choir and even started his own band. Unfortunately, due to a need for financial stability, he had to choose law over music.

One particularly dreary day, as he sat in his office surrounded by mountains of paperwork, Smith found himself reminiscing about those good old days. Suddenly, he made a decision. It was time to quit his job as a lawyer and open a YouTube channel for his singing videos.

Smith gave his resignation the very next day. He was met with mixed reactions from colleagues. Some were bewildered, others showed concern for his mental health, but a few admired his courage. Undeterred by these reactions, he began to rekindle his long-lost passion.

Smith bought professional recording equipment, made a small studio in his house, and decided to give his YouTube channel the most straightforward name: 'Smith Sings'. He started recording covers of his favorite songs from Sinatra to the Beatles, from soulful ballads to lively pop tunes. The day he published his first video, he felt an exhilarity he hadn't experienced in his years as a lawyer.

At first, his channel only had a handful of subscribers. But Smith, armed with a spirit that refused to quit, continued to record videos. His remarkable talent eventually caught attention, and his subscriber count began to rise steadily.

His rich, baritone voice resonated with viewers. His interpretations of songs were so soulful, listeners couldn't help but be moved. Comments and shares on his videos increased, and he started receiving fan emails. He had finally found his groove, his sense of purpose. 

Smith never regretted his decision to leave the courtroom for a YouTube channel. Each comment, each like, each share was far more rewarding than any case he had won. Smith had realized his true calling was not in persuading juries, but in reaching hearts through his melodious voice. In his heart, Smith knew he was finally doing what he loved most, singing.","201,160,133,89,325,99,234,84,94,206,298,331,57,317,109,161,142,195,229,279,193,15,60,74,248,123,42,225,250,334,8,244,148,164,24,29,156,86,162,3,184,329,213,178,171,170,327,306,70,66,315,79,22,191,62,153,23,264,25,318,205,238,147,32,200,159,92,10,91,87,255,176,240,294,273,198,236,65,157,130,320,78,111,55,249,180,186,119,35,52,207,76,219,326,227,285,196,241,132,283,235,231,151,83,21,116,277,45,135,208,126,59,75,134,230,308,312,262,33,287,197,140,194,165,113,71,72,49,50,124,284,304,246,4,138,224,54,96,319,63,291,330,202,158,146,93,338,37,108,80,322,243,19,333,271,311,339,169,182,141,307,58,166,174,305,30,47,188,242,106,293,266,46,136,102,117,316,297,17,118,324,48,36,247,163,292,56,107,40,299,7,128,214,245,81,217,88,155,204,267","143,199,61,10,91","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
204,"Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.","For years, Maria had worked as an executive secretary in a bustling corporate company. Each day was the same; she woke up, went to the office, typed out emails, scheduled appointments, and went home. The monotony of her work had started to become more of a chore rather than a profession. The glamour of the corporate world had faded and she found herself stuck in a ceaseless routine that was slowly gnawing at her happiness.

Maria was naturally outgoing and loved connecting with people. Her desk job was turning her into a recluse. She became bored and tired, finding no satisfaction in her job anymore. It was a tough decision but she knew it was time for a change.

One afternoon, while taking a lunch break in the park, Maria spotted a small, rundown building on the edge of the park. An idea sparked within her - a new venture, an opportunity to break free from the monotonous 9 to 5 job and to do something she had always dreamed of. 

She decided to resign from her job and with her savings, bought the rundown property. She worked tirelessly, transforming the building into a quaint, small restaurant. She wanted it to be a place where people could relax, savor their meals, and enjoy a good conversation, much like the European bistros she loved.

It was a huge risk, and the journey was not easy. Despite her inexperience in the food industry, Maria immersed herself in learning every aspect of running a restaurant. She took cooking classes and read business books, learning about finance, marketing, and customer service.

Friends and family were skeptical at first, questioning her decision to give up a secure job for a venture that had no guaranteed success. But Maria remained steadfast, refusing to let anyone discourage her. She believed in her vision and was prepared to work her hardest to bring it to fruition.

When she finally opened the doors of her restaurant, her heart swelled with pride. The smell of fresh bread and coffee filled the air and the warm, welcoming ambiance of the place reflected her personality. The restaurant was everything she had envisioned - a cozy haven that brought people together over good food.

As she greeted the first customers, she felt a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction she had not experienced in her previous job. She was proud to see her dream become a reality and it was clear she had made the right choice. From corporate secretary to restaurant owner, Maria had truly found her calling. She had not only escaped the mundanity of her old job but had crafted a new life for herself, one that she truly loved.","260,253,162,264,236,27,112,106,25,334,288,202,139,332,294,143,69,192,141,3,290,171,153,130,80,149,86,148,20,187,137,61,77,73,257,117,65,140,223,221,42,39,79,203,314,199,30,29,72,97,6,216,186,320,230,326,243,209,13,68,315,308,309,156,109,339,151,32,150,76,325,166,172,261,322,287,208,277,289,131,100,316,67,259,113,220,188,145,50,47,123,312,101,266,89,125,122,327,2,280,94,169,185,164,174,318,85,293,75,324,8,46,251,244,44,206,19,232,207,273,248,107,254,120,215,52,323,111,17,247,265,119,136,173,271,31,240,183,193,276,270,229,213,167,212,190,146,165,283,286,56,74,142,201,21,4,330,138,152,58,267,38,118,127,200,129,98,292,48,18,51,81,237,258,239,284,82,299,110,114,285,313,224,255,87,331,205,26,135,158,104,250,28,55,196,168,304,306,301,275","12,44,187,116,119","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
205,She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.,"She had been working at a prestigious architectural firm in downtown Chicago for two years. On the heels of her initial success, she was handed a project that held the potential to transform her career - the design of a new luxury condominium tower. Given its scale and importance, she put her heart and soul into the project, working for weeks on end. 

Her once neat and tidy apartment was soon flooded with blueprints, models, and sketches. Her dining table was perpetually strewn with pens, markers, and rulers, while her kitchen counters were occupied by several coffee mugs and energy drink cans. Going to bed at a reasonable hour became a luxury she couldn't afford. 

Dark circles formed under her eyes, a visual testament to her sleepless nights. Her friends and family grew concerned as they began to notice her drastic weight loss. Calls, texts, and invitations for lunch were often met with silence or declined. The project was all that mattered to her. The once vibrant woman was slowly turning into a silhouette of her former self. 

After weeks of backbreaking work, countless revisions, and numerous presentations, the design was approved by the board. She should've been jubilant. She had achieved what she'd set out to do. But she couldn't help but feel utterly drained. She was physically and mentally exhausted. The long hours, the endless to-do lists, and the constant pressure had taken a severe toll on her health.

She decided to do something she hadn't considered before. For the first time in her professional life, she decided to take a break. She decided to go on vacation for a month. It wasn't just an ordinary vacation; it was a temporary escape from her work, her responsibilities, her city, everything that had been suffocating her. 

So, she packed her bags and boarded a plane. She chose Bali as her destination - the perfect getaway with its beautiful beaches and tranquil atmosphere. Her intention was to rest, recharge, and revisit her love for life beyond work. 

She spent the days meditating, relaxing by the beach, trying local cuisines, and reading books she'd bought but never got around to reading. She also picked up a forgotten hobby - painting. The peaceful environment rejuvenated her. For the first time in weeks, she found herself laughing heartily and sleeping soundly.

After one month, she returned to Chicago, refreshed and reinvigorated. Her vacation did more than just restore her health - it offered her a new perspective. From then on, she resolved never to let work consume her to the point of exhaustion again.","93,134,219,30,203,133,201,261,55,135,323,98,175,43,299,335,296,40,15,334,46,157,324,260,280,234,188,295,112,305,254,267,194,142,167,193,250,256,32,84,222,200,9,169,111,301,22,71,86,330,41,310,37,145,159,92,190,173,293,51,307,3,229,327,97,297,241,291,204,284,2,48,232,192,304,35,106,184,162,263,214,231,47,58,309,89,33,20,287,164,211,168,94,271,282,130,129,249,328,24,326,11,120,137,54,90,292,7,136,316,242,31,178,265,207,122,10,160,128,23,216,252,14,105,53,153,67,151,83,57,165,235,257,313,95,319,227,339,61,337,258,255,155,270,170,140,226,298,315,332,266,38,333,209,306,126,101,117,16,6,233,236,262,246,272,131,276,146,186,320,212,220,199,49,64,80,66,26,268,213,141,12,18,99,318,206,36,63,104,39,72,285,19,156,116,147,325,279,88,202","200,5,69,186,115","1, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 45, 48, 49, 51, 54, 56, 59, 61, 64, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198"
206,"Post graduation, Emily decided to not go for any jobs but instead chose to travel and paint for enjoyment.","Emily had always been an exceptional student. She prided herself on her high grades and achievements throughout high school and college. Her parents had always emphasized the importance of education and expected her to excel. And she did. She graduated summa cum laude from one of the most prestigious universities in the country, making her parents and mentors extremely proud.

Everyone expected Emily to dive straight into a high-paying job. Several companies were eager to have her on board, but Emily was not as excited about this prospect as others were for her. Instead, she decided to follow an unconventional path after graduation. Emily decided to not go for any jobs but instead chose to travel and paint for enjoyment.

Emily had always harbored a deep love for art and travelling. During her hectic university years, she cherished the rare peaceful moments she could steal away with her paints and canvas. The idea of sitting behind a desk for nine hours each day didn’t appeal to her; she yearned for freedom, for exploration, for creation.

When she broke the news to her parents, they were taken aback. They couldn't understand why she would give up a successful career for such an unpredictable path. Emily's friends were surprised too. To them, it seemed like Emily was throwing away everything she had worked so hard for.

Despite everyone's shock and disapproval, Emily packed her bags, gathered her art supplies, and booked a one-way ticket to Europe. In the following months, Emily backpacked across multiple countries. She soaked in the culture of each place, conversed with the locals, and captured the soul of each city on her canvas.

Her works reflected her personal growth and experiences. People began to appreciate her art, and slowly she started selling her paintings. The success was unexpected, but it reassured her that she had made the right decision. 

Emily felt alive like never before. She painted the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean, the golden sunrise over the Tuscan vineyards, and the warm cobblestones streets of Spain. Her paintings resonated with people, and Emily became a celebrated artist in her own right.

Despite all odds, Emily turned her passion into a profession. In the process, she learned invaluable lessons about life, self-discovery, and contentment that no job could have taught her. Emily's story is not just about a post-graduation decision but a testament to choosing one’s passion over societal pressures and norms. It's about finding your happiness and embracing it with open arms.","328,205,48,42,112,293,230,67,116,59,148,122,265,16,279,157,190,29,91,35,186,239,321,140,69,331,326,306,21,308,249,339,25,169,23,127,283,210,271,110,196,244,115,266,187,201,12,71,80,192,11,159,213,56,329,162,226,250,133,66,252,208,218,229,238,90,214,8,191,39,30,245,315,325,221,259,124,232,242,85,327,132,264,111,174,254,55,257,14,36,79,295,68,75,198,31,185,189,311,32,44,220,154,3,86,296,274,202,286,224,184,128,17,160,38,19,100,141,28,233,99,107,176,168,43,167,179,235,170,135,215,228,302,240,324,166,96,78,26,109,155,151,310,114,260,18,287,272,336,10,289,77,83,258,277,282,149,180,70,47,317,178,164,207,97,323,74,150,234,27,281,158,195,46,134,203,298,275,73,251,204,54,20,246,76,227,219,222,4,332,105,291,87,143,108,113,9,236,183,268","108,176,181,2,164","1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20"
207,"When he finally started earning after years of struggle, Alex spent all his money on drinks and parties as he wanted to enjoy his life now.","Alex had always led a difficult life, riddled with hardships and steep hurdles, that kept him from the life of comfort and luxury he so craved. Born into an impoverished family, every day was a battle for survival and every night a serenade to unfulfilled dreams. He was the eldest of four siblings and he spent his younger years juggling odd jobs, hoping to provide some sort of stable existence for his family. His young dreams of prosperity and stability seemed nearly impossible.

For years, Alex lived in the same worn-out cycle, working tirelessly to climb out of the pit of poverty. He constantly juggled between the roles of a devoted son, a loving brother, and a laborer. His life revolved around work, and he felt like he was constantly drowning under the pressure of life's expectations.

As the years went by, he finally managed to find steady employment in a decent job. It wasn't a high-paying job, but it was stable. Alex was content; he could finally see the rays of the morning sun, slicing through the darkness that had shrouded his life. He had achieved a tiny sliver of the success he had always aspired to, yet his longing for true enjoyment and luxury was still unquenched.

After all, he hadn't known much of a life outside his struggle and for once, he wanted to truly relish the fruits of his labor. So, when he started earning a regular income, he was determined not to let his struggle keep him from experiencing the brighter side of life. It was as if a newfound freedom enveloped him and he started spending his earnings on enjoying the life he had missed out on.

His friends introduced him to the world of nightclubs, to the intoxication of the fine drinks, the deafening music, the fleeting adrenaline rush, and the parties that seemed to never end. With each passing night, Alex found himself delving deeper into this new life. He started spending his entire paycheck on these temporary doses of happiness, leaving little for his basic needs.

Alex believed that he deserved this reckless enjoyment after the years of struggle and hardship. He saw this life of drinks and parties as his escape from the bitter reality that had chained him for too long. He felt he could finally taste freedom, ignoring the fact that he was slowly surrendering himself to a different kind of captivity.

As the days turned into months, Alex's obsession with his newly found lifestyle started taking a toll on him. He was constantly sleep-deprived, his health deteriorated, and his work suffered. His relationships became strained as his family watched in silent despair, his friends became distant, and he had drained all his savings.

But Alex was too engrossed in his reckless pursuit of enjoyment to notice the warning signs. He continued to squander his money, hoping to find the joy he had always wanted. It was only when he hit rock bottom, did he realize that he had substituted one form of struggle for another. 

The story of Alex is one of many young people who, in their quest to escape hardship, unknowingly plunge into a damaging lifestyle, exchanging one form of struggle for another.

208,The baby looks as snug as a bug in a rug next to her mother.,"Once upon a time, in the peaceful town of Riverton, there lived a kind and gentle woman named Isabella. Isabella was beloved in the town for her kindness, wisdom, and her beautiful singing voice. However, her life was not always filled with joy. For many years, she yearned for one thing that was missing in her life, a baby.

Isabella's journey was a long and often heartbreaking one, filled with countless doctor visits and tearful nights. But as the years passed, her perseverance never faded, and she kept her hope alive. Then one fateful day, after enduring many trials, Isabella received the most wonderful news of her life; she was finally going to be a mother.

A wave of joy and anticipation swept over Isabella as she eagerly awaited the arrival of her little bundle of joy. She spent her days preparing for the baby, buying toys, knitting clothes, and decorating a beautiful nursery. Her friends and family rallied around her, sharing in her happiness and helping in any way they could.

One cold, winter's night, the moment everyone had been waiting for finally arrived. Isabella gave birth to a lovely baby girl, whom she named Lily. She was a beautiful baby with bright blue eyes and a small tuft of golden hair. The entire town rejoiced at the news, and the joy in Isabella's heart knew no bounds.

One quiet evening, Isabella was sitting by the fireplace in her rocking chair, softly singing a lullaby to baby Lily. The light from the fire danced upon her face, reflecting in her gleaming blue eyes. Lily was wrapped in a soft, knitted blanket, that was crafted with love by her mother. She looked as snug as a bug in a rug lying next to her mother.

Her face was full of peace and contentment. Her tiny fingers tightly clenched around one of Isabella's. The warmth of her mother's body next to hers, the soft lullaby being whispered into her ear, it was like a soothing balm to Lily, as she drifted off into a peaceful slumber.

Isabella looked down at Lily with love brimming in her eyes. Tears of joy rolled down her cheeks as she held Lily close to her heart. The wait had been long and hard, but the sight of her daughter, as snug as a bug in a rug, made it all worth it.

Isabella knew from that moment, that she would do everything in her power to protect and care for Lily. It was a promise she made to herself and her little one. That night marked the beginning of many nights to come, filled with lullabies, sweet dreams, and the immeasurable love between a mother and her child. A bond that would stand the test of time, for as long as they both shall live.","76,59,235,266,324,296,149,4,268,116,197,259,96,202,164,232,181,326,0,243,55,26,85,98,151,219,39,238,276,172,223,35,167,70,112,311,42,54,68,278,79,113,318,209,52,18,109,152,252,49,119,288,60,325,13,192,111,195,38,320,125,218,122,186,203,201,27,239,71,3,198,14,189,337,227,118,92,220,185,84,283,180,6,207,226,75,212,229,244,10,134,295,131,69,327,57,282,309,53,158,34,173,333,242,297,291,303,315,225,213,300,89,133,331,228,161,277,9,83,51,108,222,74,144,135,255,249,8,314,289,321,273,33,292,67,29,194,124,254,221,24,46,178,100,160,215,43,214,147,154,294,37,66,142,199,114,261,205,211,319,130,95,61,210,272,12,105,206,5,153,179,279,335,256,162,305,20,19,306,121,280,293,128,78,102,150,329,284,50,15,236,234,129,168,286,41,148,48,263,104","44,164,159,87,110","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
209,Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around.,"Sally was an introverted, quiet girl, who usually kept to herself. She had a difficult time opening up to others, often finding herself shrouded in a cocoon of solitude. Crowds gave her anxiety, and she would prefer to spend her time in the comforting presence of her books and paints. However, there was one person who managed to break through her veil of solitude. That person was Sharon.

Sharon was quite the opposite of Sally. She was outgoing, vivacious and had a sparkling personality. She had a smile that could light up an entire room, and her laughter was contagious. Sharon was the type of person who always had a crowd around her, and she thrived in the company of others.

Regardless of their contrasting personalities, the bond between Sally and Sharon was unbreakable. They had been childhood friends, growing up together, going through thick and thin, experiencing life's highs and lows by each other's side. They shared their dreams, their secrets, and their fears. They had an unspoken understanding, a connection that was strong and visible to everyone around them.

In Sharon's presence, Sally was a different person. She was open, free, and much happier. She always had a wide smile on her face, her eyes glistening with joy. Her anxiety seemed to melt away and was replaced with a serene sense of comfort and warmth.

Whenever Sharon was around, Sally was known to transform into a social butterfly. She would engage in conversations, make jokes, and even perform impromptu dances. Sharon seemed to have a magical influence on Sally, helping her let go of her inhibitions and express herself freely.

It was during one such gathering that Sally realized the profound impact of Sharon's presence. She was amidst a crowd, dancing and laughing heartily. She felt comfortable, free, and happy. A wave of realization washed over her, and she understood that it was Sharon's infectious joy and unwavering support that had made her feel this way.

Sally found her true self in Sharon's presence. She no longer felt the need to hide behind a cloak of solitude. Sharon helped Sally find her voice, her joy, and her place in the world. 

Ever since then, whenever Sharon was around, Sally became the happiest, most comfortable version of herself. The once introverted and quiet girl transformed into a confident and cheerful lady, all thanks to her beloved friend, Sharon. Sally's story was a testament to the power of deep friendship and understanding. It proved that sometimes, all one needs is that one person who can help them let their guard down and bask in the joy of self-expression. For Sally, that person was, and would always be, Sharon.","234,88,318,63,15,9,60,25,47,80,150,328,198,100,236,230,224,320,142,82,202,144,261,225,81,33,139,179,97,10,112,132,164,216,241,268,256,184,238,294,262,329,51,21,156,266,162,19,331,34,62,84,272,121,35,276,56,174,87,273,105,167,249,212,126,137,288,157,197,210,92,211,226,270,246,239,119,165,24,297,283,37,313,108,323,154,307,215,17,244,59,70,290,218,242,40,206,117,277,148,314,333,75,155,269,321,127,253,65,120,118,221,308,292,207,57,145,296,72,14,299,130,67,122,190,95,170,69,201,298,285,3,293,173,220,109,193,250,208,185,39,135,247,160,152,182,175,240,129,74,219,315,213,86,232,263,31,125,251,235,274,55,161,168,159,68,265,43,336,93,128,64,50,254,16,278,287,181,309,131,53,267,101,115,85,243,200,183,223,2,169,338,106,143,28,192,73,233,304,335","139,70,72,64,153","1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200"
210,Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.,"Jimmy was an extremely dedicated college sophomore, always striving for the best in his academics. He had been contemplating his next semester's courses for a long time. However, the uncertainty and fear of making the wrong choices always loomed over his head. It was his future he was shaping, after all, and he wanted to make sure it was right. For weeks, he was caught up in a whirlwind of university prospectuses, studying course outlines, trying to make a viable schedule.

Then, there was Professor Adams, the epitome of wisdom in his eyes. Professor Adams taught the business program and was admired by many students. The students said he had the uncanny knack of simplifying the most complex theories. The professor's guidance and advice had always been valuable to students, and Jimmy admired him profoundly.

So one day, Jimmy decided to break free from his continuous cycle of doubt and anxiety. He walked into Professor Adams's office after a lecture, his heart pounding, clutching his tentative list of courses in his hand. The professor, with his silver hair and charming smile, welcomed him into his office, filled with books and warm lighting. 

Jimmy nervously explained his dilemma about the choice of courses. He spilled out all his fears, the pressures, and expectations, desperately seeking a solution. Professor Adams, understanding the gravity of the situation for him, listened patiently, asking a few questions here and there to clarify. It was one of those moments where a mentor's compassion speaks volumes.

After a deep conversation and going through Jimmy's prospective courses, Professor Adams gave his advice. He suggested a blend of challenging yet interesting subjects that would contribute to both his personal growth and career prospects. He emphasized the importance of balance and how focusing on both hard and soft skills could benefit Jimmy.

The professor's words were like a balm to Jimmy's agitated soul. It brought clarity and gave him the strength to face his challenges head-on. He finally saw a clear path where earlier, there was a murky pool of confusion.

Jimmy left the professor's office feeling reassured, lighter, like a huge burden had been lifted off his shoulders. His features were softer, and his body seemed relaxed for the first time in weeks. He kept replaying the professor's words, dissecting them further, taking notes, and planning his next steps. 

That evening, Jimmy sat in front of his desk, looking at the list of courses he had decided to take next semester. It was finally finalized, and he was confident with his decision. He was grateful to Professor Adams, for not only advising him on his courses but also for teaching him about balance and perspective in life.

And from that day forward, Jimmy was never the same. He was less hesitant, more decisive, and had gained a newfound self-confidence, all thanks to the reassuring consultation with the professor about what courses to take next semester. His gratitude towards the professor was profound and would remain a cherished memory in his academic journey.","239,60,232,86,155,127,337,45,108,55,205,276,88,117,278,158,286,18,32,58,220,61,171,166,66,15,178,330,84,221,214,6,80,262,253,282,208,245,27,275,22,20,133,130,194,141,212,265,319,314,192,109,113,11,160,104,72,237,28,311,321,231,37,227,29,62,281,95,271,78,1,161,97,2,154,289,304,144,151,125,73,235,103,298,96,136,199,274,254,292,142,291,184,0,259,240,233,318,185,272,41,135,165,7,203,34,258,16,132,207,12,77,52,317,90,328,106,329,267,107,91,176,204,306,35,312,85,137,224,269,290,228,229,43,243,288,280,201,168,255,209,31,146,138,83,206,134,257,150,111,323,26,180,211,313,179,110,33,339,94,64,170,36,153,17,102,140,82,39,248,19,74,118,241,119,42,335,44,173,303,40,65,59,332,268,333,174,75,98,13,57,4,238,213,264,273,246,169,297,202","37,141,154,47,194","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
211,Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.,"After years of working and living in faraway lands, Frank found himself boarding a plane headed back to his home country. As he settled into his seat, he could feel a mix of emotions inside him; a sense of joy and anticipation bundled with a tiny bit of apprehension. Frank had left his home years ago, seeking employment and life experiences in foreign lands.

His work as a civil engineer had seen him traveling all over the world. From constructing bridges in the wild terrain of Africa to drilling tunnels through the mountains of South America, his job had taken him to exotic places. As much as he loved and admired his career's adventurous nature, a part of him missed the warm familiarity of home.

The neighborhoods where he grew up, the streets he had roamed, his favorite local restaurant, and especially his childhood bed - they were all calling out to him. Despite the excitement that foreign lands brought, they never made him feel truly at ease. His heart longed for a comfort that he could only find at home.

When Frank finally stepped off the plane, he was greeted by the nostalgic smell of his country's air. The language on the signs, the noise of the bustling city, and even the chaos that he used to find irritating – they all now seemed wonderfully familiar and welcoming.

His family home was just as he remembered. His childhood room had been preserved by his parents just as he'd left it years ago. The faded wallpaper, the worn-out rugs, the posters of his favorite childhood rock band, and there, in the corner, was his childhood bed.

The bed was quite small for Frank now. It creaked under his weight as he sat down, testing its durability. He wondered how he managed to fit into it as a teenager. The sheets smelled faintly of mothballs, but they were as soft and welcoming as they had been in his childhood.

Frank couldn’t help the smile that slowly spread across his face. The feeling of finally coming home was indescribable. It felt like stepping into a warm embrace, a cocoon of familiarity and comfort.

That night, as Frank lay in his childhood bed, he found the tranquility that had eluded him in the foreign lands. The memories of his youth, the whispered stories told by the worn-out walls, the dull, rhythmic hum of the ceiling fan – everything about the room and the bed felt right.

Frank finally had a good sleep that night. And not just a good sleep, but the best he had in years. It was the kind of sleep that only the familiarity of home could bring. There, in his childhood bed, Frank found his much-needed peace and tranquility after a long journey of working in faraway lands.","61,309,112,237,273,295,333,215,290,317,137,38,120,69,226,67,108,282,334,284,117,209,222,78,3,158,281,146,66,77,274,31,106,95,260,278,10,143,227,121,276,41,166,268,102,289,74,330,197,11,332,180,200,225,321,303,308,256,306,37,81,337,210,224,252,114,191,286,35,157,336,4,59,62,185,322,212,219,92,7,111,315,214,28,208,15,192,329,280,142,294,307,229,90,46,58,206,248,113,99,270,251,26,30,155,118,304,320,239,275,291,98,36,314,199,105,93,63,188,154,2,68,8,33,242,127,60,204,21,122,136,5,176,177,16,25,172,39,298,198,54,261,161,141,139,129,213,189,79,301,6,55,247,43,115,152,207,145,263,324,205,27,101,193,56,269,162,232,245,109,287,49,258,311,316,335,262,195,285,151,228,277,235,51,80,23,339,53,131,178,325,50,271,302,164,86,331,240,179,218","85,22,63,77,147","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
212,Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him.,"Linda was a woman who lived a dual life. As an executive at a high-powered marketing firm, she spent her days shrouded in an aura of seriousness and inflexibility. She had no choice but to adopt this demeanor, considering the cutthroat environment of corporate politics. This version of Linda was stony, cold, and intolerant; she hardly ever smiled, focusing solely on meeting the company's stiff targets.

Her colleagues saw her as this impenetrable fortress, forever unyielding and indomitable. She barely socialized with them and rarely participated in their casual banter. There was a silent respect for Linda in the office, although mixed with a touch of fear. This was because everyone recognized Linda for her tenacity and her single-minded dedication to her work. 

However, everything would change the moment Linda stepped out of her office building and saw her husband, Mark, waiting to pick her up. He would be standing next to their old station wagon, the one they had bought when they first got married, with a broad smile on his face. Seeing him, Linda would instantly transform into a different person. 

Once she was with Mark, the rigid executive would melt away to reveal a warm, affable woman. With him, she could let down her guard, shedding the cold, corporate shell she was forced to don every day. She could laugh with wild abandon, expressing her thoughts without fear of judgment or backlash. Her face would soften, and her smile, something rarely seen at work, would light up her face.

Mark understood Linda in a way no one else did. He knew about the pressure she faced at work and how it affected her. He understood her need to maintain a tough exterior in the office. And he provided the safe space that she desperately needed to be herself.

Linda's heart always lightened when she saw Mark. His presence alone was enough to make her feel safe, comfortable, and loved. When he was around, she didn't have to pretend or put up any fronts. She could simply be Linda.

Mark cherished these moments with his wife. He loved seeing her transform from an intimidating executive into the woman he had fallen in love with. Every day, he looked forward to his time with Linda, knowing that he was the one who got to see her true self. 

Their relationship was a sanctuary for Linda. It offered her a chance to shake off the seriousness of her work life. Even after a long, exhausting day at work, she always had Mark and their wonderful life together to come home to. It was the thought of Mark that kept her going in her demanding job, allowing her to be her true self whenever she was with him.","170,158,43,151,163,205,52,278,218,148,119,305,67,190,219,318,153,242,330,149,236,241,244,51,45,225,169,275,71,337,251,173,41,22,227,176,86,64,166,319,172,207,223,283,31,245,298,309,118,194,215,122,235,198,253,282,77,233,195,99,182,334,258,84,297,265,288,273,213,88,312,261,201,28,126,143,33,326,127,117,80,300,270,1,210,75,104,252,140,61,14,313,105,290,250,130,132,247,141,106,209,196,168,37,203,268,56,260,23,27,29,189,144,226,229,133,254,54,65,238,240,114,11,155,259,208,69,228,159,322,42,317,217,107,60,310,102,16,150,17,5,231,15,262,131,36,98,48,314,44,320,200,171,255,8,266,211,112,62,3,30,20,136,280,214,221,142,50,109,73,279,100,181,271,306,83,24,243,311,145,204,324,293,263,287,108,125,116,152,49,328,188,246,264,239,294,124,191,179,302","126,101,85,157,69","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
213,Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.,"Sally, a bright and cheerful young girl, owned a pet dog named Max. Max, a sprightly beagle, was known for being extremely loyal and friendly. He had a unique habit of always wiggling his tail, which never failed to bring a smile on people's faces. Sally adored Max, and Max shared a similar affection for her. However, there was one family member who held a special place in Max's heart.

Max always sat next to Sally's father, more than anyone else in the family. Jim, Sally's father, was a quiet man who loved reading books and drinking coffee. Max would always be right there, sitting next to Jim, wagging his tail. Jim found this companionship quite comforting. He had started to regard Max not just as a pet, but as a dear friend. This strange bond between Max and Jim was heartwarming to watch.

Every morning, Sally would see Max waiting by the door as Jim got ready for his day. As soon as Jim took a seat for his morning coffee, Max would be right there at his side. The affectionate wag of his tail gave away his happiness of sitting next to his favourite human. Every evening, they would sit by the fireplace, Max's head resting on Jim's feet, listening to the quiet crackle of the fire.

Everyone found this bond quite odd, considering it was Sally who fed Max, took him for walks, and played with him the most. Yet, the dog had found a particular fondness for her father. Sally never felt jealous, rather she felt amused by this peculiar bonding. She realized it must be her father's gentle and calm demeanor that attracted Max.

Over time, Sally's father had also developed an unspoken bond with Max. He would often share his thoughts with the beagle, considering him a sympathetic listener. Max, in return, would just wag his tail, offering comfort in his own little way.

Sally would sometimes joke that Max was probably her father's spirit animal. That the quiet, reserved nature of her father had made Max feel more comfortable and secure around him. To this, Jim would just smile, patting Max's head gently.

The relationship between Sally's father and Max was an example of the inexplicable bond between humans and pets. Sally, witnessing this bond, realized that pets bring so much more into our lives than we ever anticipate. They become an integral part of the family, affecting each member differently, but always leaving a deep impact. They provide comfort, companionship, and unconditional love, just like Max did for her father.","66,62,54,167,31,22,206,325,264,63,272,37,13,28,222,334,114,108,90,204,328,281,0,47,121,99,256,304,162,85,230,42,172,40,307,259,19,6,235,9,10,84,298,263,208,314,8,280,70,7,247,151,88,323,139,291,35,116,316,183,32,202,200,284,123,97,248,320,101,86,302,153,134,161,232,21,18,46,59,209,173,146,65,258,136,195,55,214,170,265,5,262,2,196,299,94,128,339,44,15,77,260,29,289,122,303,294,253,215,68,30,156,176,207,169,210,39,186,118,43,74,297,244,197,100,58,164,257,3,216,212,271,268,177,27,71,180,110,237,245,130,26,317,221,227,124,338,17,78,203,228,131,313,135,211,141,45,89,188,152,239,50,165,80,315,119,218,269,171,300,115,336,154,335,290,92,217,166,112,309,293,251,305,145,158,234,174,282,276,64,34,25,182,254,329,238,306,49,311,147","45,80,116,155,131","1, 5, 10, 16, 21, 25, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, 54, 59, 64, 69, 74, 79, 84, 89, 94, 99, 104, 109, 114, 119, 124, 129, 134, 139, 144, 149, 154, 159, 164, 169, 174, 179, 184, 189, 194"
214,"He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees.","James was a peculiar character. He always seemed to have an opinion on everything and a knack for arguing over the most trivial matters. The color of the neighbor's new car, the flavor of the birthday cake at the last office party, the right way to tie a shoelace - he could debate for hours on such frivolous topics. It was often as though he couldn't see the wood for the trees; so mired in the details that he often missed the big picture.

His coworkers often teased him about his unique habit. During lunch breaks, they would purposely bring up nonsensical subjects, knowing he would latch on and argue fervently. They found amusement in his ardent discussions about the correct way to load a dishwasher, or the optimal method for making a cup of tea.

His boss, Mr. Stevens, once suggested they arrange an office sweepstake for predicting what James' next bizarre argument would be. Despite his incessant bickering, James was well-liked; his eccentricities added a dash of amusement to an otherwise mundane office routine.

James, for his part, seemed to thrive in these debates. His eyes would light up, his hands would wave around animatedly, and his voice would rise in a passionate defense of his viewpoint, no matter how insignificant the topic.

One day, he stumbled upon a particularly silly topic: the ideal shape of a garden gnome's hat. Some argued it should be round to mimic the mushroom cap, while others insisted that a pointy hat was traditional and thus more apt. Naturally, James was all in, passionately arguing for the pointy hat.

He wouldn't just argue, though. He would delve into the history of gnomes, find examples in literature, art, and movies, and bring diagrams and charts to prove his point. Despite the absurdity of the subject, it was impressive how he defended his position with such rigor and dedication.

James' ability to turn any topic into a major debate became legendary. But his lack of perspective remained his biggest shortcoming. He spent so much time and energy fighting for the small, irrelevant details that he often lost sight of the bigger, more significant issues in life.

It was like watching someone meticulously examining each leaf on a tree, trying to categorize and understand them all, while completely ignoring the beautiful, immense forest surrounding them. It was at once a source of comedy and a poignant reminder of how one can get so lost in the details that they miss out on the broader, more meaningful aspects of life.

James remained oblivious to this, happily arguing about life's inconsequential details. After all, to him, every argument was a war, no matter how silly the battlefield was. It was a mystery to everyone, how someone could be so detailed and yet so lost. But, that was James. Always arguing on the silliest of topics, unable to see the wood for the trees.","120,73,306,298,192,223,302,316,7,4,148,314,329,34,74,290,233,263,235,331,142,204,215,334,183,127,23,294,175,179,82,149,198,151,156,133,27,85,248,287,81,63,222,242,260,216,101,256,1,97,295,323,17,107,31,11,268,46,144,292,221,196,190,0,5,289,169,116,89,67,229,236,124,181,246,278,241,189,310,219,54,12,64,66,58,273,326,333,90,300,197,84,9,104,296,3,166,285,137,324,239,2,161,62,291,153,103,319,88,94,115,335,211,321,339,315,203,152,99,119,243,20,255,132,164,171,313,218,33,16,45,264,180,70,322,87,18,327,188,159,72,280,212,146,309,238,230,53,312,186,193,121,250,201,108,202,170,134,135,254,75,226,113,71,317,150,52,257,83,182,217,77,147,61,158,47,307,318,24,126,57,10,43,39,76,209,102,123,25,118,213,155,178,37,59,49,205,15,160,207","23,46,171,128,80","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
215,The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.,"Congressman Gilbert Harold, a dedicated representative from Nebraska, had been tirelessly working on a bill for the better part of six months. He had an earnest belief in the importance of this bill which aimed to overhaul the public school curriculum. His goal was to integrate more practical life skills, like financial literacy and basic first aid, into the standard curriculum. 

However, he was so preoccupied with the precise wording of the bill, painstakingly ensuring each sentence was carefully crafted to reflect its intended purpose. He got deeply immersed in the minuscule details, often reworking sections numerous times to ensure clarity and precision. He prioritized the bill's presentation, fully believing that perfect wording could secure the necessary votes.

While engrossed in drafting the perfect bill, Harold failed to consider the dynamics of the political landscape. He was so involved in his work, he unintentionally overlooked the partisan polarity that characterized the current Congress. His one-track mind focused only on his bill, and not on the challenges of actually getting it passed.

The day finally came when he introduced his bill to Congress. He confidently presented his meticulous wording and explained the benefits of teaching practical life skills in schools. But as he listened to his fellow congressmen, he gradually felt his heart sink. Their discussions revealed a glaring fact he had failed to recognize: his bill, however well-worded, simply could not gather enough support to pass. 

There were concerns about increased government involvement in local schools, fears about new costs that would burden school districts, and skepticism about the effectiveness of such a broad overhaul. Many congressmen from the opposing party outright refused to consider the bill, citing a belief that education should be less regulated, not more. Others hesitated, unconvinced that the benefits would outweigh the logistical challenges the bill presented.

Meanwhile, some representatives from Harold’s own party were hesitant to back the bill, believing it to be too radical a shift. They feared a backlash from their constituents, particularly parents and teachers who might view it as an unwelcome imposition. 

Harold found himself in a tricky situation. He had poured all his energy into crafting this bill, believing it was for the greater good. But amidst the intense debates and closed-door meetings, he realized his glaring oversight. He had been so involved in the wording, he had failed to strategize about garnering political support.

After much contemplation, Harold decided to compromise, accepting suggestions for revisions and trying to appease the concerns of his colleagues. He realized that for his bill to pass, it was not enough to perfect the wording. He needed to secure political backing, to negotiate, to compromise, and to think beyond just the written word.

The story of Congressman Harold is a tale of dedication, of idealism, but also of the harsh reality of politics. It's a lesson learned that perfect wording doesn't guarantee a bill's passage - and sometimes, the political landscape is far more convoluted than the wording of a bill could ever be.","84,288,54,279,96,130,234,78,5,4,112,69,1,284,141,154,330,139,110,293,217,81,324,203,109,27,191,32,248,239,296,266,201,9,297,331,323,171,3,178,325,228,244,182,337,165,249,107,310,18,62,17,272,202,76,12,108,212,126,247,206,149,40,246,254,195,114,10,117,106,124,231,120,39,33,36,300,338,227,90,233,169,267,100,51,166,98,223,257,301,335,22,111,226,43,155,66,175,313,73,189,306,192,283,113,145,250,270,286,159,256,243,116,82,184,219,251,210,26,16,320,222,119,294,35,136,336,241,41,38,237,242,20,23,137,225,308,280,53,85,235,158,224,204,75,164,83,89,91,162,183,37,55,319,135,97,299,314,262,261,229,103,263,173,140,264,99,143,31,21,218,211,125,15,157,64,186,77,333,131,138,281,94,216,271,285,214,332,230,188,278,122,207,213,221,172,86,134,258,42","187,184,21,171,116","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
216,The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.,"Ever since John and I bought an old Victorian house with the intention of renovating it, I had noticed that his focus was strangely narrow. It was not on the outdated plumbing or the cracked tiles in the living room. He wasn't fussing over the rundown porch, or the ancient water heater in the basement. No, his attention was on one thing and one thing only - a single, rusted brass doorknob on the second-floor landing. I couldn't understand this peculiar fixation. 

""The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture,"" I mumbled to my sister over the phone, my voice laced with frustration. She tried to comfort me, reminding me that John always had his idiosyncrasies. Still, it felt like we were trying to climb a mountain, and he was focusing on one small pebble.

Every evening after our renovation work, I would see him crouched by that door, staring at the doorknob like it held the secret to the universe. Despite the cacophony of the contractors working downstairs, he would be engrossed in polishing that doorknob. His obsession made no sense to me. 

Then, one day, as he was meticulously wiping down the knob, I finally exploded. ""John! The house needs more than your adoration of a doorknob to stand up! It needs plumbing, electricity, painting, everything!"" 

For a moment, he looked stunned. Slowly, he put the polishing cloth down and turned towards me. ""Anna,"" he began softly, ""this doorknob is the first thing I want to fix because it's the first thing we touched together when we bought this house. It's our shared memory. It represents the beginning of this journey for us."" 

As he spoke, I remembered that day. We had both laid our hands on that doorknob, smiling at each other before opening the door to our future. The memory brought a warm smile to my face. 

His obsession now made sense. He wasn't just fixated on a doorknob. John was cherishing the symbol of our first step together in this shared adventure of renovating our new home. It reminded me that amidst the chaos of our project, it was essential not to lose sight of the small but significant moments that make up our shared journey. From that day forward, I began to appreciate John's ability to cherish the details, realizing they formed the bigger picture we were working towards.","131,302,133,6,164,174,282,205,70,190,82,175,212,186,217,265,332,18,80,110,236,238,237,34,64,195,258,292,41,227,167,276,305,318,123,58,324,253,128,15,268,126,68,76,57,21,171,23,271,273,327,101,170,25,290,93,94,104,189,12,36,55,256,52,125,141,310,38,202,45,113,334,297,204,20,17,182,148,284,319,283,316,219,209,183,27,320,242,315,301,277,33,74,146,180,285,106,228,323,293,213,230,336,286,295,0,247,224,331,102,257,35,272,121,111,223,49,137,53,43,54,98,7,19,267,234,117,259,88,85,66,4,181,69,296,51,198,77,99,150,214,211,149,222,191,47,201,329,312,166,206,9,162,83,322,307,65,294,177,129,143,140,330,109,199,239,178,279,75,108,136,78,28,218,37,269,248,144,138,50,61,59,275,246,84,142,139,120,44,185,29,46,255,97,207,311,165,338,250,215","141,200,15,174,83","1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
217,"The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.","The moment I laid my hands on the book, a surge of excitement ran through my veins. I had been hearing rave reviews about it for weeks and was thrilled to finally have a chance to dive into its depths. The cover design was intriguing, full of vibrant colors with a cryptic title that promised an unforgettable literary journey.

I settled into my favorite chair, a steaming mug of hot chocolate on the coffee table beside me, prepared to lose myself in the world the author had constructed. But almost as soon as I started reading, I found myself stumbling over the sentences. The grammar was irregular and not the style I was accustomed to, leading me to question whether it was a deliberate decision by the author or mere carelessness.

Every other paragraph seemed loaded with peculiar word choices, loaded with obscure words and unusual metaphors that made little sense in the contexts they were used in. As I turned the pages, I was increasingly confronted by a labyrinth of arcane words that left me more puzzled than enlightened.

At first, I thought I might be able to overlook these distractions, assuming that they were meant to add depth to the narrative. So, I continued, bearing with the convoluted writing, hoping to discover the story's essence beneath the seemingly cryptic veneer.

But the more I read, the less I understood. As each page turned, I was forced to reread passages, attempting to make sense of the unique punctuation and odd, sprawling sentence structure. The breaks in the paragraphs were abrupt, the flow disjointed, and I found myself unable to follow the book's intended rhythm.

Instead of submerging myself into the essence of the story, I was left grappling with the surface-level semantics. Despite my initial enthusiasm, the book's unconventional writing style increasingly disconnected me from its content.

In between wrestling with unconventional syntax and opaque jargon, I realized that I wasn't learning anything valuable from the narrative. The plethora of unnecessary, flowery language often left me dazed and confused, rather than inspired or enlightened.

It seemed the author's peculiar grammar and word choice were erecting barriers rather than building bridges to understanding. My initial excitement waned, replaced by frustration and disappointment. I couldn't glean any profound insights or valuable lessons from the book.

Finally, I closed the book, feeling more perplexed than before I had started. As I looked at the discarded book, I couldn't help but feel a sense of defeat. Here was a book I had so eagerly anticipated, yet I couldn't learn anything from it. Instead of imparting wisdom, its unusual style merely proved distracting.

The episode reinforced to me that storytelling is not merely about crafting intricate sentences or using thesaurus-heavy vocabulary. It's about connecting with readers, guiding them through the plot smoothly, and leaving them enlightened. The book, sadly, had failed in this essential aspect. Despite its peculiar grammar and word choice, it hadn't managed to convey its message to me effectively, leaving me with nothing but a sense of frustration and disappointment.","230,59,338,259,161,160,197,86,234,263,219,142,225,40,56,245,69,98,162,14,269,215,93,184,222,247,159,209,305,99,296,229,226,50,9,79,63,218,68,42,212,82,261,136,106,260,54,55,321,103,24,29,196,310,92,130,244,25,311,317,3,265,334,77,279,339,237,221,330,188,76,193,33,44,73,6,139,131,275,318,16,109,195,71,133,104,163,100,335,137,174,96,214,180,74,97,216,105,91,65,31,231,10,253,12,47,125,61,325,141,101,200,149,181,67,309,270,43,322,72,45,177,145,236,308,327,121,283,211,19,282,80,242,183,251,26,201,66,319,95,60,337,153,192,140,87,202,135,329,13,164,280,206,75,250,266,239,169,292,331,241,171,199,332,2,223,124,38,204,210,291,198,182,290,155,48,84,240,52,281,152,110,314,132,293,115,85,36,185,257,90,213,11,127,27,126,299,186,108,243","93,22,97,38,11","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
218,He is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.,"Dr. Ethan Miller is a man so engrossed in his work that his personal life and family seemed to have faded into the background. He was once a renowned cardiovascular surgeon, respected by his colleagues and known for his exceptional skills. His dedication to his profession was unquestionable and his desire to save lives had always pushed him to work tirelessly.

His wife, Jennifer, was an epitome of patience and love. Initially, she was supportive and encouraged him wholeheartedly, believing that his dedication to his profession was admirable. Over time though, the loneliness began to creep in. She would sit at dinner, alone, waiting for her husband who was still at the hospital, performing miracles. Her longing for companionship only grew stronger every day. 

Their two children, Alex and Lisa, were also growing distant from Ethan. Lisa, their seven-year-old daughter was always disappointed when her father failed to show up for her dance recitals, her ballet performances. Meanwhile, Alex, their teenage son, was gradually losing respect for his father, who he believed chose his patients over them.

On a regular basis, Ethan would come home late, often after everyone was asleep. He rarely had the chance to tuck Lisa in with her favorite bedtime story or have those heart-to-heart chats that Alex was beginning to need as he navigated his teenage years. He couldn't remember the last time he had a quiet dinner with Jennifer, or the last time he had laughed at one of her silly jokes.

Jennifer tried to communicate her concerns to Ethan. But Ethan, ever the dedicated doctor, saw it as a temporary sacrifice, necessary for the greater good of saving lives. Yet, he was oblivious to the fact that he was losing his own family in the process.

One day, Lisa stopped asking if her father would be there for her dance performances. She just assumed he wouldn't be there. On the same day, Alex got into a fight at school. He had no one to talk to, and the teenager's frustration only grew.

Jennifer felt the pain of her children and her own loneliness multiplied. The man she had married for love seemed like a distant memory now. Even their shared bed felt cold, empty of the love and warmth it once held.

Ethan Miller was a hero in the hospital corridors, a god who could cheat death. But at home, he was missing out on his family. His own personal life was falling apart, fading into obscurity. As his family drifted further apart, Ethan continued being engrossed in his work, oblivious to the damage it was doing to the people who loved him the most.","64,195,67,150,87,194,247,110,246,123,280,102,80,299,190,217,103,179,196,62,164,88,216,100,86,238,25,231,20,275,37,248,45,310,221,113,284,34,15,105,26,215,307,76,57,219,276,213,187,325,305,311,184,250,273,108,58,254,317,324,104,75,272,17,39,141,138,21,261,300,188,241,263,74,226,106,32,29,339,265,44,66,78,297,73,92,151,168,23,290,289,177,77,120,35,240,282,9,253,225,129,165,193,315,302,182,82,36,251,146,328,83,318,65,326,230,130,126,181,316,288,220,48,8,244,63,303,304,99,1,56,149,49,204,312,232,308,70,283,266,260,18,68,292,278,203,142,107,122,169,50,31,13,186,335,322,295,171,94,125,198,2,249,176,166,119,79,6,46,338,114,69,267,189,271,192,153,293,90,22,197,91,200,209,124,140,136,116,180,173,121,115,170,306,214,262,185,202,3,175","195,42,23,16,46","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
219,"Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.","Once upon a time, there lived a young man named Tom. An adventure-loving soul, Tom was perpetually driven by his goals and always set his sights on the next big thing. He was a passionate mountain climber and was admired by everyone for his unwavering dedication. However, more than the process, he was consumed by the ambition to reach the top, to make it to his destination.

One day, an older, experienced climber, Liam, visited their town. Liam was known far and wide for his wisdom and not just his climbing skills. Having heard of Tom’s passion, he approached the young man to share his insights on their common pursuit. He said, ""Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.""

Tom, being ambitious and impatient, initially dismissed Liam's advice as the ramblings of an old man. Nevertheless, the seeds of Liam's wisdom had been planted. As days passed, Tom couldn't ignore his words. They had somehow penetrated his single-minded pursuit, raising questions about his approach towards climbing, and life itself.

On his next climb, Tom decided to adopt Liam's advice. Instead of racing towards the peak, he took time to feel the wind and observe the lichen growing on the rocks. He tuned in to the rhythm of his heartbeat and became more aware of his movements. The mountain, it appeared, was speaking to him in its subtle ways.

Tom realized how he had been so lost in reaching the top that he had missed out on these beautiful aspects of the journey. He marveled at the vibrant flora he hadn't noticed before, the magnificent vistas he'd glossed over, and the quiet solitude he'd overlooked in his haste.

In his newfound perspective, Tom started to relish his climbs more. He savored every moment, be it the challenge of a tricky stretch or the bliss of a panoramic view. He even began to appreciate his failures, seeing them as learning opportunities instead of setbacks.

His friends noticed the change. Where they once saw a relentless climber, they now saw a fulfilled and enlightened individual. Tom's enjoyment of the journey inspired them to reassess their own approaches to their pursuits. Like a ripple, Liam's wisdom, as passed on through Tom, began to spread through the town.

Liam, hearing about Tom's transformation, smiled to himself. He knew he had made a difference. He was glad he was able to guide Tom to understand the profound truth - that the joy lies not just in reaching the destination, but also in the journey.

And so, it was that in a small town at the foot of a large mountain, a young man named Tom learned that in the interest of reaching the destination, one must never forget to experience the journey. It was a lesson he would carry with him for the rest of his life. It was a lesson he would pass onto others, just as Liam had done for him.","230,102,186,159,203,40,301,195,184,214,145,71,87,90,209,157,36,0,172,169,322,259,313,234,143,94,270,286,67,72,153,319,110,252,197,39,316,339,202,262,46,210,124,151,221,237,239,246,323,9,78,70,69,188,61,201,170,205,84,244,155,148,91,103,269,231,63,154,42,119,217,10,260,332,167,60,180,106,241,179,86,249,207,41,76,257,131,6,218,215,133,318,232,44,160,15,56,311,279,165,192,138,250,62,32,185,100,89,128,181,81,278,247,18,213,88,288,326,7,99,173,132,135,68,127,266,224,51,211,92,139,45,25,183,305,11,158,253,267,274,331,289,114,74,156,248,125,31,163,93,227,324,97,4,2,264,23,220,98,292,317,258,283,198,166,141,176,33,27,66,294,282,120,54,310,121,187,303,314,280,212,1,30,297,16,122,35,50,104,229,75,277,85,26,216,321,271,152,109,49","10,90,195,71,89","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
220,"Listen to the news straight from the horse’s mouth, his factory burned down right in front of his eyes.","Jim Thompson, a seasoned factory owner, got up from his lavish mahogany desk and shuffled towards his office window. The day had just started, and he could see his factory workers starting their shift. His pride swelled as he watched the factory operate like a well-oiled machine. He thought about the day he had opened this factory, his dream come to fruition.

Jim had inherited his father's small hat-making business. But he was a man of vision and ambition. He converted the small business into a large factory, producing a variety of clothes. After years of hard work, he had turned his family's humble hat shop into the largest garment factory in the city.

On this unfortunate day, Jim had his breakfast with his family as usual. As he left his house, he had an eerie feeling. He shrugged it off, attributing it to the grey clouds hovering in the sky.

When he reached his factory, he found his employees starting their day. He smiled at them, satisfied with the smooth running of his factory. Around noon, he was in a meeting with potential investors when he smelt something strange. It was acrid and filled his nostrils, signaling danger.

Jim turned his eyes toward the window to see thick, black smoke billowing from the factory floor. He excused himself hastily from the meeting and rushed downstairs. He couldn't believe his eyes. His factory, his dream, was on fire. Flames consumed his machinery and spread rapidly. Panic ensued as workers scrambled to safety.

He rushed towards the factory, pushing past his employees who were trying to hold him back. He could see the years of his hard work getting turned into ashes. He fell to his knees, unable to grasp the severity of the situation. He felt powerless, watching the flames lick the walls of the building.

The fire department arrived soon enough, but it was too late. The building was half collapsed already. The firefighters could only prevent the fire from spreading further. The factory, however, was unsalvageable. 

As the embers settled, Jim stood there in the rubble, his heart breaking. Now he was there to relay the story. To tell everyone the news straight from the horse's mouth: his factory, his life's work, burned down right in front of his eyes. He could not help but feel a sense of foreboding, his worst nightmares unfolding right before him.","216,108,188,272,185,123,177,178,190,154,303,126,5,289,128,37,208,267,318,10,146,275,57,121,314,122,62,254,203,212,329,15,132,244,331,330,227,76,12,176,140,65,74,234,251,133,215,119,100,136,125,113,35,23,103,252,242,204,296,339,106,0,214,124,263,266,202,281,129,198,231,207,241,300,130,223,238,54,156,264,114,59,30,311,205,158,80,201,277,257,118,199,159,2,209,147,192,283,309,9,116,305,75,166,221,31,175,79,109,3,148,52,315,173,258,308,127,71,42,282,131,325,144,338,155,182,294,332,217,83,225,183,312,295,184,60,232,101,16,261,255,302,200,235,117,256,206,64,145,334,211,326,139,284,134,104,102,142,243,317,160,336,112,298,186,279,191,68,168,39,67,218,152,222,135,333,6,82,162,224,41,161,240,246,290,110,53,38,34,230,164,50,151,1,137,226,291,179,95,280","105,174,76,180,131","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
221,"Lets meet him and ask about the robbery. Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear.","Jerry and Tom were typical small-town journalists, often finding themselves discussing possible scoop around town. One day, as they were chatting over coffee, a news item on the local radio grabbed their attention. There had been a robbery in town at Mr. Vincent's house, the wealthy recluse who hardly stepped outside his mansion. 

""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" Jerry suggested, eyes glowing with curiosity. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear."" 

Tom agreed, eager to break out of their typical routine, and they decided to approach Mr. Vincent the following day. The duo arrived at the massive gates of Vincent's mansion, nervous but excited. They were met by a sour-faced butler who escorted them inside.

The mansion had an eerie air about it. The lights were dimmed, old paintings adorned the walls, and a grand wooden staircase led up to the upper floors. In the middle of it all sat Mr. Vincent, a frail old man with piercing blue eyes that seemed to hide a thousand secrets. 

Seeing his guests, he asked, ""Why have you come?""

""We are from the local newspaper, sir,"" Jerry explained. ""We wanted to discuss the robbery."" Mr. Vincent nodded, inviting them to sit.

Over cups of bitter black coffee, they asked about the incident. Mr. Vincent started narrating his experience, his voice echoing in the grand old house. He spoke about how he was caught off guard by masked intruders, about their cold and calculated manner, about his helplessness in the situation.

Each word sent shivers down Jerry and Tom's spine, painting a vivid picture of fear and panic. They listened, their reporter instincts kicking in. They took note of every detail, from the time of the attack to the stolen items.

To their surprise, Mr. Vincent seemed more saddened than scared. He mourned the loss of heirloom pieces, each carrying a significant past. For him, the robbery wasn’t just about losing valuable items; it was losing pieces of his past. 

Jerry and Tom thanked Mr. Vincent for sharing his story. They left the mansion feeling sobered by the experience but excited about the potential this story had.

By the end of the day, they had their story ready. It wasn't just about a simple robbery. It was about an old man living alone in a mansion, about lost treasures and stolen memories. It was more thrilling and emotional than they'd imagined, proving once again that there was always more than what met the eye.","157,276,178,172,285,218,145,125,82,236,192,126,5,73,188,231,308,213,200,111,39,41,171,256,124,206,83,129,84,47,51,152,79,119,42,208,267,303,190,261,268,225,272,30,86,237,104,69,0,253,312,210,24,337,324,54,211,197,116,98,95,179,220,310,7,9,14,233,115,127,232,325,112,50,307,25,184,195,60,209,296,338,265,302,36,35,260,263,102,161,176,224,131,80,118,151,63,44,168,189,339,299,245,255,320,10,49,222,122,335,108,327,59,37,246,223,305,273,331,317,21,22,311,227,71,196,43,321,34,182,28,52,74,88,322,107,198,240,185,226,91,306,309,180,106,68,81,247,87,266,160,27,8,201,249,12,290,58,70,292,132,149,166,150,191,242,142,250,336,11,109,57,235,187,248,105,61,136,66,259,199,288,76,18,45,183,262,26,214,23,234,103,203,330,65,284,300,277,244,316","63,108,116,92,42","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
222,I want to attend the lecture as it will be delivered straight from the pioneer of the subject.,"My excitement was uncontrollable as I came to know about the announcement. One of the greatest minds in the field, the pioneer of the subject himself, was to deliver a lecture at my university. For me, this was an opportunity of a lifetime. I was thrilled at the thought. My mind raced with anticipatory questions and thoughts. I want to attend the lecture as it will be delivered straight from the pioneer of the subject.

The subject in question was Astrophysics, something I had always been passionate about. The pioneer, Professor Albert Ignatius, was a legend. His work on interstellar matters, gravitational waves, and black holes had revolutionized the field. His theories and postulates had formed the basis of modern Astrophysics. Being able to witness him share his knowledge and insights in person was a privilege.

The mere thought of the lecture made my heart beat faster. Professor Ignatius was a venerable figure in the world of science, and I had always admired his work. This lecture could possibly be a turning point in my academic career. I aspired to learn directly from his wisdom, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.

As the day of the lecture neared, I prepared diligently. I revisited his research papers and books. I wanted to ensure that I was well-equipped to grasp every word he spoke. I also scribbled down all the questions that I wanted to ask him in person.

The day finally arrived and I was a bundle of nerves. I took my seat in the front row, eager to absorb every word. As Professor Ignatius stepped onto the stage, the entire hall filled with thunderous applause. He began his lecture with a humble introduction, illustrating his years of experience and knowledge.

The depth and clarity in his explanations were commendable. Each word he spoke was profound and filled with wisdom. His lecture provided me with the understanding I had yearned for. His words filled me with an unparalleled motivation.

I found myself completely engrossed in his discourse. I was astonished by his ability to simplify complex theories and present them in an accessible manner. The lecture was inspiring, eye-opening, and enlightened me in ways I never thought possible.

As the lecture concluded, I found myself filled with a new sense of purpose and direction. Being able to attend the lecture delivered straight from the pioneer of the subject was indeed a transformative experience.

Everyone was enjoying the festive ambiance when Aunt Linda said, ""Oh, have you heard about Mike's incident last week?"" The murmurs of conversation dwindled as everyone turned their attention to the curious matter.

""It was rather odd,"" Aunt Linda continued, her eyes sparkling with excitement, ""But I think it would be best if Mike himself told the story. You know, being the one who actually experienced it firsthand."" Everybody agreed enthusiastically, nudging Mike, who was quietly sipping his coffee at the end of the table. He put down his mug and stood up, the center of attention now. 

""Alright then,"" Mike began with a slightly nervous chuckle, ""But remember, you asked for it.""

It was a regular Tuesday morning when the incident occurred. Mike woke up and prepared for work as usual; his mundane routine did not give him any hint of the unusual circumstances that were about to unfold. As Mike left his house and started his car, he noticed that the engine was making strange noises. Thinking it was just a small glitch, he drove to his workplace, an architectural firm.

At work, the peculiarities continued. As he started drafting a blueprint, his computer crashed inexplicably. IT support was puzzled too, as they could not find any bug in the system. After several hours, they finally managed to get his computer working again. 

When Mike returned home that evening, his house appeared different. His front yard was ravaged, plants upturned and furniture moved around. A startling sight, the destruction looked like the aftermath of a mini-tornado. 

Mike's neighbors then revealed the shocking truth. A wild bull, having broken away from a farm several miles away, had caused this destruction. Apparently, the bull had a particular affinity for his red car and had been attracted by the car's bright color. The bull, charged at his car repeatedly, causing the engine to rattle and, later that day, confused by his house's windows reflections, rampaged through his yard.

Amidst gasps and laughter, Mike concluded, ""So that's my story. You can believe it or not, but I'm still dealing with the aftermath of a bull's affection for a red car.""

His family looked at him, wide-eyed and incredulous. Linda clapped her hands, delighted, and said, ""See, I told you! Mike, you always have the best stories!"" Amid the laughter and light-hearted teasing, Mike rolled his eyes, promising himself to get a different colored car and hopefully avoid any more adventurous encounters with runaway farm animals.","224,166,20,146,122,126,36,271,19,186,326,265,98,7,312,247,304,38,310,152,16,128,227,123,237,184,327,258,303,158,189,137,245,45,167,244,242,71,33,225,328,190,92,306,162,316,97,238,285,107,0,177,138,30,220,144,135,201,58,47,205,151,228,105,67,195,34,124,17,270,273,334,215,208,269,261,281,149,207,222,89,321,217,266,81,63,51,153,198,116,323,157,241,292,120,168,188,290,307,57,236,315,302,263,102,255,70,88,233,182,279,99,218,259,179,191,206,197,240,278,159,55,49,336,249,1,296,213,330,112,131,27,246,325,173,136,164,95,172,23,289,22,262,156,216,132,9,239,101,280,260,169,178,200,298,268,221,141,100,21,199,15,13,251,96,12,339,338,192,297,293,322,3,176,5,331,145,31,121,333,301,56,18,80,300,113,248,83,160,277,48,140,231,274,335,214,134,111,317,62","55,157,80,1,40","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
224,He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.,"Once a nameless figure that lurked in the shadows, his grim countenance now illuminated by the bright studio lights, he was called on national television. The audience, a captive one, was eager, terrified, and fascinated. This wasn't your everyday talk show guest; he wasn't a celebrity, an intellectual, or a politician. He was a serial killer, known for his chilling crimes that had previously only been detailed in hushed whispers.

The infamous criminal had been apprehended after a decade-long manhunt, his reign of terror finally brought to a chilling halt. His grisly crimes had fascinated and horrified the nation in equal measure. Now, he was about to talk about them, live on television. As the announcement of his appearance spread, a peculiar silence took hold, an expectant quiet before the horrifying storm of revelations.

People across the country huddled around their television screens, waiting in a morbid anticipation. Friends called each other to ensure they wouldn't miss it. Families sat around their living room, their usual chatter silenced. There was an unsettling air of excitement, as if they were about to witness history, albeit one of a dark nature.

When the criminal appeared on screen, his casual demeanor sent a cold shudder down the spine of viewers. He was a nondescript man, his very ordinary appearance belying the monster within. Yet, his cold, emotionless eyes betrayed the horror he had unleashed on his unsuspecting victims.

The host, a seasoned journalist, tried to keep her composure, the reality of the situation sinking in. She introduced him, her voice quivering ever so slightly. The audience held their breath, and she finally asked him about his horrendous crimes.

He began to narrate his acts with an unnerving sense of calm, as if discussing the weather. Each brutal detail described in his monotonous voice, every cruel act he had committed, unveiled with an eerie nonchalance. The audience listened in horrified silence, their faces a mix of fear, disgust, and morbid curiosity.

As he revealed the motives and methods behind his horrifying acts, the unimaginable became reality, every sentence more chilling than the last. There was a palpable tension, a morose fascination that held the nation captive. A chilling confession, straight from the mouth of a serial killer, broadcasted to millions of horrified spectators. 

As the program concluded, an eerie silence lingered in the air. The horrors he had spoken about were still echoing in the minds of the viewers, an unwanted memento of the dark side of human nature. The night had laid bare the chilling tale of a monster living among them, a specter of fear that would haunt their dreams for nights to come.","66,65,309,56,114,93,149,194,248,167,123,163,68,45,98,298,269,161,57,284,99,273,338,204,23,28,120,234,189,76,104,139,19,147,208,255,299,47,219,312,190,40,157,138,41,126,20,262,174,82,33,242,0,301,196,46,137,232,226,5,128,187,106,313,78,317,333,328,94,303,178,282,252,306,256,216,200,247,142,221,168,1,220,162,183,131,15,72,211,112,294,198,281,280,159,291,170,305,289,206,105,84,129,235,241,50,210,268,283,39,145,272,53,203,44,325,85,62,177,13,213,132,80,14,253,64,307,238,116,274,278,12,201,229,222,276,61,240,191,339,295,181,90,17,63,35,251,87,55,51,199,69,331,103,304,310,125,124,209,308,38,227,336,243,225,292,215,22,244,266,8,314,164,21,36,154,302,324,43,286,158,59,195,134,267,42,230,18,148,71,175,217,29,223,318,60,214,119,254,3","83,80,135,194,165","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
225,Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.,"Sam was known in her group of friends for her vivacious storytelling ability. As an avid movie-goer, she always brought back captivating stories about the latest films she had watched. This time, she had ventured out to watch a highly anticipated film that had just been released. Everyone in her group was eager to know about it. Therefore, it was unanimously decided: let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.

As soon as Sam arrived, her friends gathered around her in a cozy little circle. The room was buzzing with excitement. Sam was beaming from ear to ear, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. Everyone knew that a thrilling tale was about to unfold. 

""I'm so excited to share the story of this movie,"" Sam began, her voice full of anticipation. ""The film was titled 'Eternal Shadows', and it was unlike any movie I have ever seen.""

Silence filled the room, with everyone hanging onto every word she uttered. ""The movie started in an old, seemingly abandoned mansion. The eerie stillness of the house was contrasted by the sudden, violent thunderstorms outside,"" she narrated, her hands mimicking the thunderous claps and flashing lightning.

Her friends listened with rapt attention, her vivid descriptions transporting them straight into the heart of the movie. It was almost like they were right there, living the cinematic experience through Sam's animated narration. ""The main character, a young woman named Elara, arrives at the mansion, unaware of the secrets it holds,"" Sam continued, her tone filled with mystery and suspense.

As Sam delved deeper into the story, her friends couldn’t help but gasp, laugh, and even shudder at the appropriate moments. She introduced them to every character, explained their significance, and painted a picture of every scene in exquisite detail. The story unfolded, full of twists and turns that kept everyone on the edge of their seats.

""The climax was absolutely stunning!"" Sam exclaimed, her eyes wide with remembered shock and awe. ""Just when you think you've figured it all out, the film hits you with an unbelievable revelation.""

When Sam was finished, the room was silent for a few moments, her friends lost in the magic of the movie she had so vividly narrated. Everyone agreed that no one could have told the story better than Sam. It was indeed the right decision to let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.

Once more, Sam had proved her storytelling prowess. Her passion for movies and storytelling was infectious, leaving everyone in the group excitedly discussing the film's plot and waiting eagerly for the next movie outing. And of course, they all looked forward to hearing another story from their friend, Sam.","170,191,116,120,13,304,335,74,275,109,337,261,114,54,150,15,118,246,8,86,78,290,69,136,244,229,157,143,324,280,3,98,285,19,80,233,89,95,153,131,55,217,331,134,250,47,318,34,221,183,271,339,207,20,112,65,228,325,220,338,142,2,334,294,206,197,103,327,164,51,166,276,222,215,146,232,305,100,90,104,72,67,255,44,177,45,273,148,33,301,224,306,40,83,64,179,211,329,256,274,76,279,37,214,87,115,268,88,121,181,330,218,31,188,219,93,312,297,307,321,239,269,234,168,4,22,149,156,91,194,252,140,41,236,29,6,203,286,262,163,184,129,81,189,296,117,277,24,223,110,202,97,174,66,57,185,63,132,151,242,235,124,200,17,253,278,260,248,9,171,254,199,145,25,209,190,158,210,141,56,311,165,53,111,208,328,26,1,107,295,162,182,155,302,263,7,101,50,303,49","59,49,73,149,91","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
226,This shopkeeper always palms off old stock to the customers.,"In a small town, there lived a wily shopkeeper named Mr. Leonard. He owned a simple, modest shop that was brimming with a variety of items, making it the busiest store in town. Despite its popularity, the townsfolk held a shared complaint about Mr. Leonard: this shopkeeper always palmed off old stock to his unsuspecting customers.

In contrast to his dubious ways, Mr. Leonard presented himself as a smiling, genial old man. He was always ready to help his customers find the best items available. However, it was his clever rhetoric and persuasive manner that often left people returning home with products they had never intended to buy.

In the depths of his shop, he had a separate section where he kept his old stock. This wasn't out-of-date or expired items, but things like clothes that had lost their vibrancy, electronics lacking the latest features, and books with dog-eared pages. Mr. Leonard believed in no wastage; every item deserved a second chance.

Lily, a young girl, once entered Mr. Leonard's shop with a handful of change, looking for a birthday present for her mother. Taking advantage of Lily's innocence, Mr. Leonard managed to sell her an old, out-of-fashion locket at an inflated price. Lily, delighted to find a seemingly perfect gift, remained unaware of Leonard's deceptive tactics.

Word of Mr. Leonard's habits made their way around town and the initially bustling store started to see fewer customers. However, the clever shopkeeper always found a way to lure them back in. Whenever a new customer showed up, Mr. Leonard would give them a grand welcome and make them feel special. He would convince them that the old items he was selling were 'vintage' and had a unique charm, impossible to find in modern products.

However, not everyone fell for his manipulation. One day, a sharp-witted customer, Mrs. Beaumont, confronted Mr. Leonard when she realized a lamp she'd bought had a defective switch. ""This isn't vintage, Mr. Leonard, it's just old,"" she called him out, causing a stir among the other customers. 

Mr. Leonard, of course, had a well-rehearsed apology and a discount offer at the ready. Yet, the word spread around town and finally, his customers started doubting his sincerity. His clever tactics no longer worked as they used to. They began examining their purchases closely, not easily taken in by Leonard's silver-tongued persuasion. 

The townspeople slowly learned the lesson to value their own judgment over persuasive words. Despite his charming ways, Mr. Leonard found it harder and harder to palm off his old stock onto the increasingly savvy customers. It was a wake-up call for him, marking the beginning of a long overdue transformation in the shopkeeper's trading practices.","194,23,39,114,51,116,269,241,110,35,270,183,167,264,185,52,8,127,9,273,255,321,156,2,228,217,292,113,311,218,291,96,210,132,256,174,121,230,222,6,124,328,133,129,250,78,289,198,293,247,61,327,93,164,317,101,102,100,336,130,221,333,47,172,338,12,186,295,63,40,227,235,138,229,62,312,57,68,231,150,75,17,128,158,104,112,103,313,80,81,71,251,83,240,263,234,294,95,18,302,122,90,119,41,152,37,282,261,266,131,31,188,245,243,88,14,281,161,67,242,162,77,184,190,97,202,58,237,214,233,65,82,219,28,135,332,175,4,212,195,301,168,326,91,265,159,258,260,38,87,203,98,46,288,215,15,5,276,275,309,197,173,94,146,254,139,55,192,299,213,29,53,141,329,306,142,84,205,99,208,25,60,79,303,42,246,320,193,334,163,11,157,283,278,274,136,66,177,108,196","71,25,74,38,79","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
227,She tried to hand over the hardest part of the assignment on me so she doesn't have to do it.,"Ella was a peculiar girl, both cunning and clever. She was also undeniably charismatic and could charm anyone into doing her bidding. We were partners in our final year project - a complex assignment that counted for half our grade in the advanced physics class. She was usually the one who took the lead, directing me to do the less complicated tasks while she handled the intricate calculations and theories. To me, it seemed like a fair division of labor.

However, things took a surprising turn when we received the final part of the assignment. Our professor, the stern and detail-oriented Dr. Wilson, had set out an incredibly difficult task. This task was set to test our understanding of quantum mechanics - a topic that was not Ella's forte but was definitely mine.

Ella, despite her bravado, was horrified at the prospect of grappling with the intricacies of quantum mechanics. She wasn't keen on losing her reputation as the class's top student. In her desperation, she tried to do something that I had not expected. 

One day, after class, she approached me with the assignment in her hand. She expressed her overwhelming concerns regarding other commitments she had and how those were taking a toll on her. With her best puppy-eyed look, she asked me to take over the hardest part of the assignment, so she didn't have to do it.

Honestly, I was startled, but I quickly saw through her act. I knew she was trying to manipulate me, playing on my sympathies to get me to do her part of the work. Yes, I was good at quantum mechanics, but it was only fair that she put in her share of the effort too. And I wasn't going to let her off easy.

I looked at her and with a calm, composed voice, told her that I would not be doing her work. I explained that this was an opportunity for her to learn and push her boundaries. It was time she faced her weaknesses head-on, rather than avoiding them.

Ella was taken aback by my stand. She tried to cajole me, even attempted to bribe me with promises of future favors. But I stood my ground. 

In the end, Ella did take up her part of the assignment and worked on it herself. It was indeed a struggle for her, but she managed to pull through. I could see the change in her as she handled the challenge and overcame her apprehension.

The day we turned in our assignment, I saw a different Ella - one who had grown, learned, and become stronger. She was no longer the girl trying to hand over the hardest part of the assignment on me so she doesn't have to do it. She was now someone ready to embrace challenges head-on, turning obstacles into opportunities for growth.","217,338,228,183,197,240,266,114,72,288,289,212,242,135,285,24,143,178,9,189,149,165,35,283,306,158,102,85,37,146,162,145,113,167,120,247,245,270,171,333,238,174,265,209,86,4,190,188,318,201,129,311,191,321,0,14,58,98,241,278,119,51,154,23,307,78,291,30,140,100,67,326,48,193,230,63,269,170,308,194,69,15,239,76,57,332,233,41,169,325,106,10,157,250,300,38,141,122,229,203,152,103,336,96,268,290,40,287,231,335,232,131,8,218,281,207,90,327,73,159,275,127,320,310,95,334,235,182,274,200,32,150,330,213,175,331,286,225,226,172,282,49,298,126,80,52,216,55,328,94,224,257,71,54,208,25,221,92,115,252,258,28,211,123,329,117,303,339,68,105,65,198,262,124,17,139,234,176,273,91,319,19,173,271,56,7,1,3,46,109,177,223,251,313,248,26,315,83,136,74","139,3,99,75,109","1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149"

However, he soon learned that the city wasn't as glossy as it appeared in the magazines or movies; especially in a peculiar part of town where the flashy lights and glam were overshadowed by the hustle of peculiar individuals. This area, not found on the standard tourist map, was infamous for one thing: guys trying to pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.

These men, often found tucked away in dark alleys, or bustling marketplaces, seemed perfectly ordinary to the untrained eye. They would casually blend with the crowd, striking up harmless conversations, luring unsuspecting souls into their web of deceit. The one tool of their trade? A suitcase filled with gleaming, seemingly authentic Rolex watches.

In this part of town, there was a man named Sal. Sal was the kingpin of this dubious trade. Suave, charismatic, and quick-witted, he was a master of deception. He had the gift of the gab that could convince even the savviest of customers. He would sweet-talk them, showing off his collection of ""authentic"" Rolexes, each one apparently more unique and valuable than the last.

Sal had an uncanny knack for picking his customers. He would analyze their appearances, demeanor, and gullibility, even before initiating a conversation. A loaded businessman on a shopping spree, a tourist looking for a memorabilia, or a young man trying to impress his girlfriend with a flashy gift, Sal could sniff them out from a mile away.

One day, a young couple, holding hands, walked into Sal's part of town. Kevin and Lisa, both fresh out of college, were exploring the city. Kevin wanted to impress Lisa, hoping to buy her an expensive gift. Sal spotted them immediately, his eyes lighting up at the sight of an easy target.

Sal approached them with his charming smile, praising Lisa's beauty and Kevin's choice in women. He then smoothly segued into his sales pitch, presenting his counterfeit watches. The couple, intrigued by Sal's eloquence and the beautiful watches, were hooked.

He showed them an exquisite piece, a ""Rolex Datejust,"" which he claimed was a limited edition. Kevin, eager to impress Lisa, decided to buy it, brushing aside the part of him that suspected something wasn't right. He paid a hefty price for the watch, much less than an actual Rolex, but significantly more than what the watch was actually worth.

Leaving with a satisfied grin, Sal disappeared into the crowd, leaving behind a blissfully ignorant couple, ecstatic over their new purchase. It was just another day in this part of town, and another tale of cheap watches sold off as authentic Rolexes.","133,317,148,221,127,151,281,229,183,80,22,65,247,240,167,79,115,321,5,270,232,45,329,235,283,330,139,78,175,49,89,83,311,239,282,43,38,230,300,225,37,323,138,231,52,202,245,181,263,159,122,207,123,128,76,255,218,279,219,313,325,135,95,315,256,59,217,32,312,44,272,100,85,142,189,335,275,293,286,220,173,146,73,226,6,301,233,197,40,31,86,8,192,187,309,298,105,77,106,62,64,250,119,68,285,210,152,324,97,39,103,29,165,266,252,82,277,268,184,111,297,259,290,273,19,10,215,131,112,156,316,118,203,161,223,55,74,195,287,130,278,302,253,180,201,258,284,265,211,132,92,120,334,4,337,47,104,33,48,107,66,271,227,117,169,144,251,328,213,69,257,109,168,327,147,99,179,93,149,14,243,70,102,291,332,16,304,170,333,200,318,110,7,63,254,299,88,310,116,134","84,163,8,38,44","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
229,Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.,"Victor is an old acquaintance of mine, we have been attending the same school together for years. The peculiar thing about him is his penchant for old coins. He always carries a small pouch with him, with different old coins jingling inside it. Sometimes, it seemed like he liked the sounds they made when he walked. 

One day, as we were enjoying our lunch break at school, Victor reached into his backpack and brought out the small pouch. ""I've got something to show you,"" he said, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. Opening the pouch, he placed a few coins on the table, a fascinated grin spread across his face. They were all different, some tarnished with age, others catching the sunlight in their metal frames.

""Now, these aren't ordinary coins,"" Victor began, ""they are rare and valuable."" I examined one, finding it hard to see what Victor did. To me, they looked like old, forgotten coins that someone had discarded. Victor, however, treated them like they were made of gold. 

He went on to tell me about the different coins, their origin stories and their supposed worth in the coin collectors market. He picked up a coin, holding it up against the sun, its details illuminated. He talked about its history with such enthusiasm that I couldn't help but listen. 

""Would you be interested in buying some?"" He asked. I hesitated, unsure of whether to invest my pocket money into something I didn't fully understand. But seeing Victor's hopeful gaze, I decided to give it a try.

Over the next few days, Victor showed me more coins, each one wrapped in a rich, fascinating story. We spent our lunch breaks discussing these little pieces of history. Despite my initial reservations, I found myself looking forward to these little sessions.

However, I noticed that not everyone was as accepting of Victor's hobby. Some kids laughed at him, calling his coins worthless trash. Victor never responded to them, focusing solely on his precious treasures.

As the school year progressed, I couldn't help but notice Victor's enthusiasm diminish. Despite being passionate about his coins, the ridicule he faced was chipping away at his spirits. I could see him retreat into his shell, becoming less talkative.

Feeling protective over my friend, I decided to buy more coins from him, not only to show my support but to show others that I believed in his hobby too. The sparkle in Victor's eyes when I did that made every cent worth it. It taught me to appreciate the passion in people, the joy they derive from something as small as old coins.

Victor's story wasn't about old coins after all, it was about finding value and rarity in simple things around us, a lesson he unknowingly taught me through his unflinching passion. And I am thankful to him for that.","250,24,159,264,207,200,7,177,338,61,226,327,129,172,227,188,125,281,270,150,170,120,23,163,126,257,334,260,82,134,92,332,62,266,314,280,251,213,102,19,57,65,190,182,293,149,320,22,173,171,75,197,231,165,176,244,43,66,8,49,228,55,157,234,107,58,255,135,28,34,117,94,299,282,138,97,296,330,193,27,290,287,5,205,309,128,54,30,103,206,115,106,245,298,225,67,101,29,239,86,179,204,84,331,185,196,21,214,144,155,162,339,220,242,93,316,305,292,321,47,111,72,143,3,33,248,285,230,99,85,289,160,105,308,317,274,318,26,53,279,142,186,51,119,73,295,131,52,224,247,17,256,78,211,312,81,184,265,154,195,12,88,240,325,278,297,148,315,183,199,161,208,130,38,291,263,310,122,262,14,20,187,139,243,31,288,98,166,91,313,335,90,15,137,140,2,156,267,253,124","11,15,61,128,53","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
230,The music producer selects a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client.,"Renowned music producer, Max Stanton, had reached a level of success in the industry that allowed him to be selective with his clientele. While there were many artists and labels he enjoyed working with, there were a few he found himself less enthused about. His least favorite client was a smug, up-and-coming rapper named Danny Dimes, known for his dismissive behavior and lack of understanding of the music industry. Today, he was scheduled to work with Danny.

Max prided himself on delivering the best he could for every client, regardless of personal feelings. However, with Danny, it was different. Max found his attitude off-putting and disrespectful, and each interaction left a bitter taste in his mouth. He was torn between his commitment to professionalism and his growing resentment towards Danny.

As he rifled through his collection of beats and melodies for Danny's session, he remembered an old song that had never gained traction. It was different from the chart-topping compositions Max was known for. It had a unique rhythm, a difficult meter, and a melody line that was less mainstream. Max had always felt it was beautiful, but none of his previous clients had agreed.

An idea sparked in Max's mind. He would give this challenging piece to Danny, let him wrestle with its nuances. He couldn't deny the small feeling of satisfaction at the thought of Danny struggling to turn this song into a hit. He selected the song and prepared himself for the forthcoming session.

When Danny arrived, Max presented him with the song. Oblivious to the hidden implications, Danny accepted it, though his face showed his clear confusion over its unconventional style. Max couldn't help but enjoy the evident disarray.

Days turned into weeks, and Max watched as Danny battled with the song, his smug demeanor slowly replaced with frustration. His lack of musical knowledge was apparent as he consistently failed to grasp the unique rhythm and melody, unable to twist it into the mainstream formula he was accustomed to. 

Despite the satisfaction Max felt watching Danny's struggle, he also saw something unexpected: growth. Danny, in his desperate attempts to master the song, had unknowingly begun to better understand music. He was listening more, questioning, trying harder, and, shockingly, beginning to respect the process.

In the end, Danny managed to make the song his own, transforming it into a unique track that stood out from his previous work. It didn't top the charts, but it gained recognition from critics for its unconventional style, signaling a new direction for Danny's career. 

While Max had intended the song selection as a veiled insult, he was surprised to find himself feeling a sense of satisfaction, not from Danny's struggle, but from his growth. Danny had learned a valuable lesson about music, and Max had learned a lesson about judgement. Despite his initial intentions, the music producer had ended up helping his least favorite client, in ways he had never anticipated.","101,281,205,34,21,196,269,129,22,1,128,328,236,132,136,5,215,203,45,140,323,318,52,338,10,306,297,100,32,86,88,124,90,197,139,209,9,98,257,131,137,336,113,261,108,167,309,6,302,293,240,232,254,337,320,278,117,60,172,3,153,174,99,221,265,298,334,314,295,141,64,229,256,220,148,312,151,30,23,77,11,50,14,191,12,204,154,27,180,322,81,46,335,15,103,185,24,31,279,285,56,94,258,17,283,244,55,313,226,264,193,118,48,133,91,73,329,184,142,114,72,127,339,301,156,316,266,49,150,85,78,195,231,79,270,121,4,182,111,178,155,317,253,40,37,165,80,307,152,176,66,160,217,332,308,107,216,235,219,43,162,272,125,84,315,304,62,227,326,210,241,249,234,294,130,120,168,201,170,135,218,290,164,228,300,173,289,89,54,186,33,58,198,275,188,61,189,159,26,158","109,168,184,72,133","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
231,The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.,"In the heart of Paris, the scent of garlic and fresh baguettes perfumes the air. Here, tucked away in a narrow cobblestone alley, lies a small but renowned restaurant, Chez Pierre. This charming bistro, cloaked in the inviting aura of rustic vintage charm, is helmed by Pierre, a master chef who has spent years refining his craft.

One afternoon, a customer walked into Chez Pierre, looking quite overwhelmed. She was a young, meek woman, timid and seemingly lost, exhibiting a visible anxiety that was uncharacteristic of Pierre's usual clientele. Her apprehension was more than just the culture shock of being in a new city; it stemmed from her limited experience with trying diverse foods.

Having served customers from all walks of life, Pierre recognized the woman's discomfort instantly. He approached her with a warm smile, welcoming her into his restaurant, his home away from home. He quickly sensed her trepidation towards the extensive, complex menu that boasted dishes such as 'escargot' and 'coq au vin.'

Pierre made the decision, then and there, to guide her through her culinary journey. He strode back to his kitchen, navigating through the organized chaos like a ship's captain through rough seas. He pulled out an old, well-used notebook, its pages worn from years of recipe tweaks and adjustments. This was his collection of simpler recipes, compiled during his early days as a budding chef.

Determined to ease the woman's fears, the chef flipped through the pages until he landed on a comforting classic - 'Quiche Lorraine.' The quintessential French delicacy, a perfect harmony of creamy egg, smoky bacon, and sharp cheese within a flaky crust, was easy on the palate yet undeniably satisfying.

Back at the table, he explained his choice to the shy woman, describing the dish with all its nuances and subtleties. His eyes shone with passion as he painted a picture of the rustic French countryside from which the dish originated. Her apprehension seemed to fade, replaced by a spark of curiosity and anticipation.

In the kitchen, Pierre prepared the 'Quiche Lorraine' with practiced ease. The sizzle of bacon, the aromatic herbs, and the beautiful dance of culinary artistry unfolding in his kitchen felt more purposeful than ever. 

When he finally presented the dish to her, he watched nervously as she took her first bite. Her eyes widened, and a smile spread across her face, chasing away the remnants of her fear. Pierre, elated, realized then that he'd not merely served a dish; he'd transformed the culinary world for one less adventurous customer.

The girl left Chez Pierre that day with a newfound sense of culinary curiosity. She promised to return, and with a nod and a smile, Pierre knew he had indeed added another adventurous soul to the world of gastronomy.","183,25,36,102,261,30,99,85,151,230,54,118,229,12,300,101,50,78,251,225,262,86,250,330,176,156,267,323,189,223,100,121,133,137,26,203,178,140,161,68,76,7,15,136,80,53,63,338,20,290,144,43,124,131,145,167,40,60,162,236,150,295,322,8,193,113,5,9,331,233,320,179,159,337,212,6,172,81,38,293,175,114,327,164,228,109,171,130,79,35,28,265,77,321,328,155,127,303,107,237,207,181,32,96,302,117,239,119,252,89,45,264,273,90,84,174,47,285,112,74,192,115,42,314,82,111,197,297,182,304,270,215,116,170,184,44,134,279,268,332,141,202,138,70,110,13,210,263,246,22,226,157,325,188,23,61,75,56,39,272,214,195,315,318,64,217,185,29,3,186,143,276,147,88,122,284,14,326,168,95,98,191,200,227,55,94,205,177,59,219,244,129,152,69,204,257,57,298,287,324","151,184,85,13,10","Here are the top 10 most analogous stories to the target story:

232,"Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.","Ian, a renowned detective in New York City, sat at his desk, engrossed in a pile of files. He could hear the buzzing of his office as detectives rushed around, phones were ringing endlessly, and the faint aroma of black coffee filled the air. He rubbed his temples, the weariness of sleep deprivation apparent on his face. He had been at this for three straight days.

Looking at the mess on his desk, he grabbed his phone and dialed his assistant's number. She picked up almost instantly. ""Yes, Detective Ian?"" she chirped, her voice bright and energetic. Ian sighed inwardly, wishing he could borrow some of that energy.

""Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry,"" he said wearily. His tone was firm but respectful, displaying the rapport they shared. She hummed a quick acknowledgement and he hung up, turning his attention back to his work. 

Ian had been assigned to a high-profile case involving a prominent business tycoon accused of multiple murders. The media was buzzing with speculation and every news channel was covering the shocking story. The case had turned into a public spectacle, and Ian had the unenviable task of bringing clarity amidst chaos. 

To complicate things, he was constantly bombarded with phone calls from reporters, other departments, and even victims' families. The calls were becoming a hindrance, disrupting his train of thought. He knew he had to isolate himself and focus completely on the case to piece together the jigsaw puzzle. 

The evidence was stacking up, but there were missing links. Witnesses contradicted each other, security footage was hazy, and the suspect maintained his innocence. Ian had to sort through the chaos, find the common thread, and connect the dots. His reputation was on the line, but more importantly, justice was waiting to be served. 

As Ian drowned himself into the sea of paperwork, the world outside his office ceased to exist. Hours stretched into a day and soon the office was quiet. The phones had stopped ringing, and the rush of detectives had died down. Only the periodic buzzing of the old office clock broke the silence. Ian's eyes were glued to the case file, his mind racing with the facts, making connections and dismissing theories.

In the seclusion of his office, without the constant interruptions, Ian's mind began to grasp the intricacies of the case. Slowly but surely, the picture was becoming clearer. Suddenly, he understood, the pieces fitting together in his mind. 

He looked at his empty coffee cup and smiled. Yes, he had bigger fish to fry, and now, he was ready to make the catch. He picked up the phone, dialed the police commissioner, and said, ""I've cracked it.""","242,97,234,51,162,287,251,274,208,125,258,13,23,75,280,222,261,87,226,263,240,106,56,9,21,161,135,329,60,132,299,224,210,49,189,330,104,150,159,53,331,231,124,315,37,289,113,239,47,171,99,290,236,288,131,15,338,220,123,68,7,74,19,77,30,175,327,102,122,38,83,205,332,90,12,147,163,79,257,230,76,248,154,183,116,174,285,108,107,45,0,136,264,194,198,308,149,281,312,181,192,235,50,153,29,101,191,166,89,31,277,271,227,157,269,10,301,24,211,26,91,134,33,11,54,217,16,59,61,300,334,284,265,321,182,42,221,279,112,115,120,336,133,233,1,176,70,151,142,144,78,193,228,170,259,229,94,139,311,309,199,197,297,335,178,201,25,320,254,195,164,65,317,126,28,187,129,40,273,237,14,143,276,80,218,215,209,109,39,137,146,310,169,200,138,8,339,252,190,244","144,3,102,53,180","1, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150"
233,"Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention.","Tom was always the determined sort. Right from the start, his peers recognized his focus and dedication as something truly extraordinary. However, it was most evident when he had an important event to plan for. During those times, Tom would completely isolate himself from the rest of the world. He would not meet with any of us, his closest friends, for anything short of an emergency. Instead, he would pour every bit of his energy and attention into planning for the event with an unparalleled focus.

This was his ritual, a habit that took shape right from the early years of high school. Back then, it was planning for the annual school play. Then it transitioned to his role as the president of the student body in college. Before we knew it, Tom's planning skills were in high demand, especially with significant corporate events within our town.

I remember vividly when he was tasked with organizing the city’s annual marathon. For weeks, we didn't see him. His house was like a fortress, surrounded by numerous charts and papers filled with meticulous plans. Every hour of his day was dedicated to ensuring that the marathon was a success.

He became a ghost, a phantom. He was there, yet not there. His presence was felt in every detail of his plans, but physically, he was absent from our lives. The only way we knew he was alive was the constant light that streamed from his study window late into the night, a testament to his ceaseless work.

He missed birthdays, parties, and friendly get-togethers. We came to accept that when Tom had an important event to plan, he wouldn't be around. It was something we accepted, not grudgingly, but with respect for his dedication. 

Once the event was over, Tom would be back, apologizing for his absence and promising to make up for the lost time. His guilt was always evident, but we understood. We admired his unyielding commitment to perfection. 

His self-imposed isolation did lead to remarkable results. The events Tom planned were always executed flawlessly. Every detail was thought of, every contingency was considered, and every participant or guest would leave impressed. 

Yes, we missed him during his periods of isolation. But we also admired him, respected him, and most importantly, we were proud of him. For whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention. And we knew, that's just how Tom was, dedicated, committed, and thoroughly exceptional.","215,120,61,162,258,134,336,155,76,94,254,139,217,72,10,198,33,165,158,314,263,333,247,243,91,212,62,48,207,109,194,171,132,113,257,0,71,190,272,219,111,78,275,316,140,84,99,232,34,66,43,279,92,260,253,83,87,317,186,154,259,104,326,6,26,248,128,74,59,320,222,79,69,51,313,216,163,25,124,151,311,5,223,191,224,295,282,105,98,249,44,19,149,80,49,156,210,122,116,169,269,226,138,230,119,23,305,161,13,281,244,102,137,30,65,205,188,38,339,42,89,177,47,288,53,118,153,14,231,196,28,183,325,242,237,172,264,202,236,17,15,160,2,178,220,285,251,235,182,252,331,103,159,337,88,4,209,327,239,175,27,240,228,255,36,308,189,273,85,24,319,213,21,283,246,145,270,20,338,46,298,293,284,238,322,81,35,201,101,234,150,112,310,63,133,204,321,60,227,45","48,190,148,139,135","1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
234,"Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.","Ramos, a middle-aged writer with a receding hairline and expressive brown eyes, made a definitive decision one Friday afternoon. He had been struggling for months with writer's block. It felt like an immovable object lodged in his mind, stifling his creativity and causing him countless hours of frustration. However, he resolved to finally complete his novel over the weekend.

Knowing that he couldn't concentrate at his bustling city home, Ramos decided to retreat to a more isolated location. He had a rustic log cabin nestled in a woodland area, just a few miles away from the nearest town. It was a place where civilization's noise was replaced with the gentle whisper of the wind and chirping of the birds - an ideal place to write in peace.

So, he packed his old typewriter, a few essentials, and his treasured stationery into his car and set off. The cabin stood tall among the mighty oaks, with its rough-hewn wood glowing under the sunlight. As he unlocked the door and walked in, a waft of cool, musty air greeted him. It had been a long time since anyone had lived there, but for Ramos, this was a familiar and comforting environment.

He set up his typewriter at a small table by the window that overlooked the forest. Fresh air filtered in through the window, mixed with the faint scent of pine and damp earth. With a quiet sense of determination, Ramos began to type. Each click of the typewriter was a testament to his resolve.

His mind became a powerhouse of activity, words flowed from his fingers like a raging river. Characters danced to life, conflicts rose and fell, love bloomed, and mysteries unfolded. Each page he filled with ink was a step closer to his goal. His novel was finally taking shape, developing into a captivating narrative that kept him engrossed late into the night.

As the sun began to set, the woodland creatures sang their evening songs. Ramos, undisturbed and concentrated, continued his work. He was like a craftsman, meticulously shaping his creation. He wrote deep into the night, fueled by a potent mix of stubborn resolve and black coffee.

When the first light of Sunday morning pierced the dense woodland canopy, a sense of accomplishment filled him. He looked at his stack of typed pages with satisfaction. Ramos had done it. He had finally finished his novel.

It was a triumph over himself and his writer's block. Ramos packed his typewriter and manuscript carefully. As he drove back to the city, he carried with him a sense of accomplishment and relief, knowing that he had completed his novel undisturbed at his cabin over the weekend.","237,194,53,206,288,73,51,116,99,10,154,49,138,101,83,204,139,170,141,184,233,176,252,305,102,133,19,48,84,322,186,7,245,299,227,148,130,265,168,42,151,256,232,302,135,77,127,88,196,44,309,267,228,14,92,90,209,144,35,74,231,37,65,285,123,271,122,280,321,79,137,62,275,217,333,125,183,297,223,195,292,216,32,191,158,30,117,40,54,115,75,156,20,240,300,39,67,301,71,93,335,124,199,198,70,21,311,326,134,317,181,225,47,132,190,171,224,153,104,143,310,313,69,56,320,81,18,247,27,251,319,229,226,238,31,36,147,96,82,23,140,235,161,160,24,315,261,241,308,46,219,113,207,307,91,57,64,61,197,175,6,121,339,131,281,86,60,105,291,159,211,103,163,205,192,295,189,203,258,236,260,142,254,222,212,22,41,214,68,242,174,173,152,279,78,118,63,257,213,259","43,21,142,180,1","1, 5, 10, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, 31, 34, 38, 42, 46, 49, 53, 56, 60, 64, 68, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91, 95, 99, 103, 107, 111, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 135, 139, 143, 147, 151, 155, 159, 163, 167, 171, 175, 179, 183, 187, 191, 195, 199"
235,"The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.","Dr. Phillips was a renowned surgeon in the city hospital, known for his impeccable skills and professional dedication. On one particular evening, he knew he was faced with a highly significant surgery the next day. He was to operate on a distinguished diplomat who had been rushed to the hospital with a critical heart condition. Realizing the importance and seriousness of the task, he wanted to be fully prepared and focused.

Dr. Phillips gathered his team for a quick briefing. ""Tomorrow is an important day,"" he began, outlining the complexity of the upcoming procedure. The responsibility was immense, and he emphasized the need for each team member to be diligent and alert. 

His next request, though, was an unusual one. ""I'd appreciate if you all wouldn't interrupt me with any minor tasks or questions,"" he explained. He wanted his mind completely unencumbered, giving him the space to thoroughly review the medical case in peace. The staff nodded in understanding, acknowledging his request.

That night, Dr. Phillips went home but didn't unwind as he typically would after a long day at work. Instead, he spent his time reviewing the patient's medical history, the specifics of his condition, and the intricate details of the procedure he'd be conducting. He knew that a surgery of this magnitude required his absolute focus, and every distraction could potentially jeopardize the operation's success.

The next morning, he arrived at the hospital earlier than usual. His mind was consumed with thoughts of the surgery, his nervous energy palpable. He went straight to his office, going over the plans for the operation one last time. The hospital staff, understanding his request from the previous day, let him be. They handled the minor tasks and solved petty problems that typically formed part of the everyday hospital routine. 

The anesthesiologist came to update him about the patient's pre-surgery status, and Dr. Phillips appreciated his staff's respect for his need to focus. The silence of his office and the absence of interruptions allowed him to mentally map out the procedure, helping him be as prepared as possible.

Finally, the time for the operation arrived. Dr. Phillips was alert and focused, having spent the previous night and morning in intense preparation. With the knowledge that his team had kept distractions at bay, he confidently entered the operating room.

In the end, the surgery was a success, thanks in part to the respect and understanding of his dedicated team. Dr. Phillips thanked them, acknowledging that their help in maintaining his focus was invaluable. From then on, the staff understood the importance of their roles even in silent support, and they were more motivated than ever.","232,5,11,200,187,302,215,75,300,77,241,318,60,223,258,31,294,42,55,338,193,100,273,113,131,297,127,180,135,249,109,141,339,96,286,146,332,38,65,265,153,53,247,270,45,50,144,125,240,2,256,237,301,292,23,246,166,312,188,112,91,82,129,183,52,278,277,203,10,209,25,309,244,136,172,276,79,94,71,204,201,224,165,34,123,225,234,66,115,74,333,266,133,97,17,48,140,177,229,103,331,16,87,155,282,44,128,49,207,310,196,314,181,83,13,27,147,218,168,295,319,3,132,51,156,41,259,279,311,143,116,233,274,284,19,219,253,238,194,40,158,308,269,85,298,104,197,43,14,145,288,306,150,255,248,236,160,68,186,178,124,28,26,84,185,98,199,303,33,64,81,272,307,162,46,80,63,264,76,205,70,208,254,57,106,334,121,296,89,283,59,36,99,250,206,120,315,191,184,61","1,132,87,156,52","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
236,Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.,"Philip was an ambitious project manager for a prestigious tech company. With a large project looming over him, he found himself inundated with stress and the magnitude of the responsibilities involved. It was a project that could change the trajectory of his career, a remarkable venture that could land him a promotion or leave him jobless if not done meticulously. 

The project involved a complex algorithm that would revolutionize the way their software functioned. It was a monumental undertaking that could change the face of technology. It was his brainchild, and he was the only person capable of putting all the pieces together and turning it into a reality.

With the deadline rapidly approaching, Philip knew he needed an entire day of unbroken focus to wrap up the project. In his crowded mind, filled with numbers and coding languages, there was an undercurrent of anxiety. His nerves were frayed, his palms sweaty, his heart pounding against his chest as if it too was urging him to complete the task at hand.

In a decisive move, Philip took a day off from work, devoting it solely to the task. The morning of the day, he woke up early, his head clearer than it had been in weeks. The sun was only beginning to rise, casting a warm glow over his quaint home office. 

He took a few moments to gather his thoughts, a brief respite before the storm of work that was sure to follow. Gathering up all his strength, he switched off all of his devices, leaving only his computer running. The sudden silence was almost deafening. Yet, there was a sense of tranquility that filled the room.

Philip sat in front of the computer, hands poised over the keyboard. For a few moments, he sat motionless, a statue staring blankly at the screen, gathering his thoughts. Then, as if an invisible force pushed him, he began typing. 

The room was filled with the click-clacking of keys, an orchestra playing a symphony of productivity. He immersed himself entirely in the project, every line of code painstakingly placed, every function carefully thought out.

As hours passed, he forgot about the world outside. He was in his zone, his mind operating at its peak. He was tired, yes, but there was a certain exhilaration that was driving him.

By dusk, the project that had once seemed insurmountable was nearly completed. His eyes were burning, his body screaming for rest, but he didn't stop. As the sun dipped below the horizon, he put in the final piece of code. 

Exhausted yet triumphant, Philip could hardly believe it. The project was done. He had done it. He leaned back, a satisfied grin stretching across his face. The silence around him was no longer daunting but comforting, a reward for the productive solitude he had chosen. His career was secure, his ambition fulfilled.","65,283,5,13,138,38,79,127,76,3,112,33,157,122,203,84,175,242,36,201,266,164,330,64,278,132,78,291,274,305,74,44,173,254,268,238,286,63,50,261,115,48,233,285,231,23,133,47,49,116,323,75,155,140,290,335,220,129,324,267,20,208,126,121,60,14,325,143,153,237,282,331,145,333,147,146,93,222,327,246,83,57,284,58,200,312,81,235,149,102,114,28,70,281,61,240,51,159,25,141,113,319,304,152,52,328,307,171,30,276,280,289,177,19,158,86,18,169,165,190,40,306,90,217,271,298,197,204,184,339,302,329,139,67,21,131,224,234,250,42,170,195,185,296,287,72,316,160,100,269,10,111,148,46,4,11,187,178,277,92,106,99,117,229,6,41,252,80,232,124,263,9,35,264,255,95,119,142,120,199,270,320,243,309,68,8,273,136,318,260,77,218,253,301,176,206,315,87,207,310","169,43,138,88,70","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
237,"My mother had an important conference to prepare for, so she refused to entertain our day to day rants and fights.","My mother, Angela, was a renowned scientist and held a prestigious position at the National Institute of Astrophysics. This year, she had been chosen to present her groundbreaking research at the International Astrophysics Conference. She was usually a doting mother, patient, and tolerant of the mischief that my younger brother, Leo, and I would get up to on a regular basis. However, this year was different. The stakes were high and this conference was extremely important for her.

In the months leading up to the conference, she would lock herself in her study for hours at a stretch. Her time became increasingly occupied by her preparations. Preparing for the conference required a lot of work and she was up to her ears in it. Instead of telling us bedtime stories, she now worked late into the night and barely had time for breakfast. Our home, once filled with laughter and our playful shouts, now bore a silent, almost somber atmosphere. 

Leo and I, being typical siblings, had our share of daily disagreements and petty fights. Our tussles usually ranged from arguments over who got the bigger piece of cake to squabbles about who would control the television remote. In the past, mom would intervene, mediate our disputes, and make sure we made up by the end of the day. Now, everything had changed. 

One day, we were bickering over a trivial matter, our voices echoing through the otherwise quiet house. Usually, this would be the point where mom would step in and resolve our disputes. But not that day. Instead of rushing in to broker peace, she remained in her study, consumed by her work. 

Taking advantage of her absence, our arguments escalated and soon we were involved in a full-blown sibling war. Our fights, which usually ended with a stern look from our mother, lasted for hours, intensifying with each passing minute. The house was in complete chaos, but surprisingly, mom did not appear.

Eventually, tired of fighting, Leo and I entered mom's study with a rehearsed apology, hoping to restore peace. We were met with a sight we had never seen before. Our usually composed and patient mother was sitting at her desk, surrounded by heaps of papers, her hair disheveled, and a look of exasperation clear on her face. 

""Mom, we are sorry for our fight,"" Leo started, but she held up her hand to silence him. 

""I love you both, but I have an important conference to prepare for,"" she said, her voice weary but firm. ""I cannot afford to entertain your day-to-day rants and fights.""

That was the day we realized that our antics, while amusing to us, were taxing for our mother. We understood that sometimes, even parents needed space and quiet. It was a turning point in our relationship, not only with our mother but also with each other, and we learned the valuable lesson of respecting others' boundaries.","150,190,108,273,35,253,24,188,128,158,66,18,0,75,201,265,123,305,269,155,86,291,89,262,315,263,274,34,249,240,154,2,208,295,93,124,4,5,186,79,41,225,40,57,233,76,323,120,298,72,227,334,91,73,257,292,68,256,110,226,39,320,303,168,153,139,100,174,69,55,206,51,259,65,156,328,167,42,325,88,217,307,339,267,97,282,105,261,81,111,214,318,329,33,260,202,159,170,294,228,264,136,234,326,112,296,71,310,191,297,171,223,61,230,236,235,319,272,56,314,22,144,25,30,281,94,157,121,129,47,212,132,181,178,289,251,164,85,169,231,327,125,275,308,53,288,198,20,12,28,161,200,32,211,173,101,337,13,241,134,321,84,15,133,3,48,232,122,194,210,10,279,280,31,224,316,300,268,254,166,192,137,176,114,203,220,222,19,276,216,90,17,127,258,255,271,117,126,175,244","167,45,103,116,115","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
238,"Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.","Andy was a diligent employee at Anderson Enterprises, the firm he had been working at for the past five years. He was always seen going the extra mile, turning in projects before deadlines, and helping out his co-workers. His dedication earned him respect from his peers and superiors. However, an event occurred that would test Andy's previously impeccable record.

Andy made the decision to play hooky from work for an entire week, claiming to be ill. It was uncharacteristic for him, but a feeling of burnout had him desperate for a break. He needed the time to recharge and revitalize his passion for his work. Thus, he made the choice to feign sickness. 

Every day of that week, he'd call his boss early in the morning. He would suppress his guilt and use a hoarse voice, coughing here and there to make his act convincing. He played his part well, even sending in a fake medical certificate to solidify his claim. However, unbeknownst to him, his boss started having doubts.

His boss, Mr. Anderson, was a stern and sharp man. He had been running the firm for decades and prided himself on his ability to spot dishonesty. Andy's sudden illness and prolonged absence roused his suspicion. Although he had always found Andy to be trustworthy, something wasn't adding up.

As the week came to an end, Mr. Anderson decided to investigate. He asked some of Andy’s co-workers if they noticed anything strange about him before his alleged sickness. The responses he received puzzled him further. The peers informed him that Andy seemed perfectly fine, not showing any signs of illness.

His suspicion grew stronger and he decided to take things a step further. He got in touch with the medical institution from which Andy's certificate was supposedly issued. To his dismay, they informed him that they had no record of Andy's visit or treatment.

Once Andy returned to work, Mr. Anderson confronted him. He showed him the discrepancies he had discovered and expressed his disappointment. He told Andy that he was on very thin ice. If he was found to be dishonest again, he would face severe consequences, perhaps even dismissal.

Andy was remorseful and vowed to regain his boss's trust. He realized that his need for a break had pushed him to dishonesty, something he had never done before. He promised himself that he would find more ethical solutions in the future. He understood now that no job was worth sacrificing his integrity for.","226,253,6,18,170,112,201,160,87,130,205,110,8,185,42,217,148,63,276,149,192,26,316,320,9,133,329,211,96,284,117,114,67,191,180,144,332,164,330,322,143,189,281,307,299,159,300,325,156,111,124,24,222,141,269,50,214,43,40,259,224,270,12,10,254,151,267,198,243,315,157,308,239,292,274,137,287,153,336,53,248,116,102,74,145,126,92,65,152,69,273,58,216,321,173,264,38,86,249,240,255,21,193,197,90,34,283,231,288,135,19,78,175,28,294,101,174,297,196,331,318,176,221,218,27,241,108,233,80,204,327,223,266,95,52,199,186,250,177,105,302,247,1,179,32,120,162,106,209,23,41,109,125,228,337,203,187,64,139,195,229,113,30,79,147,317,262,107,39,88,291,263,212,324,261,20,150,75,190,61,333,194,154,242,55,66,237,98,293,163,70,314,59,15,206,334,89,119,97,35","73,100,126,184,69","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
239,The manager saw that Silvy was passing on her clients for hair appointments to other professionals but was showing up for tips; she decided to fire her the next time.,"Shelly, the manager of the upscale hair salon 'Style Strokes', started noticing an unsettling pattern. She saw that Silvy, one of her most experienced stylists, was consistently passing on her clients' hair appointments to her less experienced colleagues. This started to bother her as Silvy had been with the salon for five years and had always been dependable and professional.

Silvy had been excellent at her job and was highly regarded by her regular clients. They often opted to get their hair done by Silvy due to her skillful styling and charming personality. However, recently, Silvy seemed to be less interested in doing actual work and more interested in socializing with the clients.

Shelly noticed that even though Silvy was passing on her appointments, she was showing up at the salon just in time for the clients' payments. She started noticing Silvy mysteriously appearing near the counter when her clients were settling their bills and leaving tips. This was surprising because Silvy had never shown such greedy behavior before.

One day, Shelly decided to confront Silvy about her odd behavior and asked her why she was shirking her work duties. Silvy tried to brush it off casually, stating that she was merely trying to help the new stylists get more hands-on experience. But Shelly wasn’t convinced. 

She continued to monitor Silvy’s actions closely and found that nothing had changed. Shelly was deeply troubled by Silvy's irresponsible conduct and the negative impact it was having on the salon's reputation. Clients were beginning to voice their disappointment about not getting their preferred stylist. Additionally, the other stylists started complaining about the sudden workload.

Shelly was a strong believer in fairness and respect in the workplace. She was all for giving chances and helping her employees grow, but Silvy’s behavior was increasingly becoming unacceptable. She decided that if Silvy continued to exploit her position for personal gain and compromise the salon's professional standards, she had no choice but to fire her.

And so, one rainy Tuesday, as Shelly noticed Silvy once again dodging her appointments while waiting for the tips, she made up her mind. Shelly decided that it was time for a change. She was going to fire Silvy the next time she caught her red-handed. She felt a pang of regret for having to lose such a talented stylist but knew that it was a necessary step to maintain the integrity of her salon.","166,178,164,335,297,197,35,263,192,269,120,231,134,98,219,168,322,237,144,148,38,34,169,138,221,334,205,186,37,96,12,152,0,257,159,124,327,291,70,8,15,167,185,194,278,133,125,301,127,136,40,308,48,276,65,104,190,333,214,31,339,200,328,71,131,100,248,183,113,89,258,50,254,162,208,304,30,177,147,260,331,114,103,10,201,60,84,284,9,259,292,20,242,234,189,156,252,228,288,180,36,216,283,294,2,79,53,74,32,246,299,204,170,206,86,241,76,225,137,91,272,300,129,122,43,105,281,179,19,130,275,101,55,196,44,154,112,49,46,163,209,223,126,158,155,311,232,78,320,93,287,243,4,172,157,107,29,11,160,207,220,187,56,54,141,62,181,7,314,286,21,61,110,285,240,142,249,238,87,236,58,121,218,312,153,146,116,63,261,39,23,97,108,57,111,41,266,302,77,273","178,175,116,93,152","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
240,"Soon after, Garry realized that Hannah was avoiding making the presentation by pretending to be occupied by personal issues, he planned to approach her about it if she repeated it again.","Garry had always been one to have an eye for detail, and his keen observation skills often came in handy during his role as a project manager. Of course, this meant that he was often the first to pick up on the subtle shifts in behavior among his teammates. One of his team members, Hannah, had been displaying some unusual behavior lately.

She was usually very eager and active in her role, always ready to jump headlong into her work. In fact, her enthusiasm and energy were infectious and often drove the rest of the team to match her intensity. However, recently, she seemed to be falling behind.

At first, Garry chalked it up to a temporary slump. Everyone had their off days. But as the days turned into weeks, Garry couldn’t help but notice the pattern. Hannah was dodging her responsibilities, particularly when it came to making presentations.

Garry would assign her a task, and instead of her usual gung-ho attitude, she would shrug and promise to get to it, but she always found a reason not to. The excuses varied: a family emergency, a personal problem, even a sick pet. Garry was initially sympathetic, after all, life happens. 

However, over time, her stories became more and more unbelievable. The frequency with which they happened didn't add up either. Hannah always had some personal issue or another that made it impossible for her to work on her assignments.

Garry began to suspect that something was off. It seemed to him that Hannah was intentionally avoiding making presentations. He grew increasingly certain that Hannah was pretending to be occupied with personal issues to avoid making the presentation.

But why would she do such a thing? Garry couldn’t fathom a reason. He knew Hannah was talented and capable. She had always performed well in the past, and presentations were her forte.

Deciding to bring the matter to a resolution, Garry planned to approach her if she repeated this behavior again. He didn’t want to accuse her without reason, but the pattern was too consistent to ignore.

The next time Hannah claimed to have a personal issue, Garry decided he would bring the issue to the forefront. It was important to maintain a clear line of communication in the team, and such behavior was affecting the morale of the rest. It was time to face the problem and find a solution.

What puzzled Garry the most was the change in Hannah’s behavior. She had always been confident and articulate, so why was she now shying away from the spotlight? Garry was determined to find out.

He kept a watchful eye on Hannah, ready to step in the next time she tried to avoid her responsibilities. In his heart, Garry hoped Hannah wouldn't repeat her actions. But if she did, he was prepared to confront her and resolve the issue.","185,8,338,138,162,314,339,166,0,203,9,74,333,145,183,243,301,161,269,279,125,267,3,49,263,2,197,170,65,326,236,153,253,19,201,60,28,302,291,155,313,71,106,214,283,122,204,259,148,173,276,196,92,220,104,22,56,109,241,289,310,324,255,217,213,192,256,141,94,11,282,327,44,311,152,57,83,101,26,149,151,231,238,146,305,90,15,299,52,209,17,66,307,193,321,232,288,29,85,172,199,143,234,332,260,331,330,5,223,34,75,107,48,96,134,297,24,120,132,292,309,112,189,159,290,158,219,258,68,31,295,247,21,32,36,150,78,194,139,179,188,23,254,115,147,187,61,230,59,154,76,266,46,337,296,43,81,97,40,69,304,80,14,62,119,124,270,239,144,63,198,272,64,51,12,163,233,181,1,137,225,202,177,242,195,169,54,268,18,13,171,264,222,274,281,86,294,200,140,142","83,168,59,184,16","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
241,Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.,"Philip was a clever lad, often finding ways to dodge the household chores. He preferred to spend his time buried in his favourite novels, exploring galaxies far away, or immersed in the world of his console games. His mother, Mrs. Baker, was a woman of patience but firmly believed in the importance of every family member contributing to housekeeping. There was one tactic Philip frequently employed to avoid tasks: pretending to be busy.

One sunny morning, Mrs. Baker handed Philip a long list of chores. He scanned the list: mowing the lawn, washing dishes, cleaning the attic, etc. He frowned at it, already planning his escape. With a fake nod, he set off, promising to complete them before sundown.

He quickly settled in his room, launching his favourite game. Hours passed in a blink, the chores momentarily forgotten. When Mrs. Baker asked for an update, he would reply, ""Nearly done, Mom!"" and resume his virtual battles.

His mother, slightly suspicious, decided to investigate. Quietly, she approached his room, peeping through the slightly ajar door. There sat Philip, lost in his gaming world. His chores were completely untouched.

She was disheartened but not surprised. Instead of confronting him immediately, she decided on a different approach. She quietly retreated, deciding to let Philip continue with his facade.

At the end of the day, Philip showed up, pretending to be exhausted from all the work. Mrs. Baker acted oblivious, commending him for his hard work. Unknown to him, he was soon to face a reality check.

The next morning, Mrs. Baker handed Philip an even longer list. Seeing his puzzled expression, she calmly stated, ""Since you managed your chores so efficiently yesterday, I thought I'd give you some more responsibility.""

For the rest of the week, Philip found himself immersed in housework, from the break of dawn till the evening. Every day, a new list awaited him. It felt as though the chores were multiplying, overwhelming him. It was tiring, and he had zero time for his beloved books and games.

By the end of the week, Philip was exhausted and learned a valuable lesson. He finally understood the importance of sharing responsibility and contributing to the household chores. The ploy of pretending to be busy backfired, leaving him with a whole week of chores as punishment. The lesson was harsh, but it was indeed a lesson learned. From then on, Philip made sure to fulfill his duties before indulging in his interests. His mother's teaching had taken root in a way she never imagined.","93,216,210,313,9,338,238,318,295,182,250,296,312,203,335,172,283,136,91,94,242,158,128,171,227,63,309,7,117,253,260,127,284,287,279,31,263,230,278,39,101,185,237,276,30,132,195,25,120,95,187,34,149,70,248,206,190,99,275,231,65,224,334,118,151,302,298,213,316,181,257,84,232,204,305,199,314,100,317,164,331,42,179,202,28,73,5,200,20,207,258,57,115,244,254,168,188,87,13,163,292,294,299,97,44,53,105,123,240,184,140,194,134,180,12,64,29,47,211,148,209,212,332,49,59,304,125,252,155,339,192,133,106,280,268,126,74,162,58,144,245,92,75,153,56,69,321,221,108,175,293,137,61,173,246,160,178,229,33,71,130,301,201,328,259,103,320,38,310,4,303,169,46,170,281,214,269,333,82,189,239,67,146,48,68,274,262,197,223,297,233,85,243,272,79,325,43,271,114,27","7,181,109,21,193","1, 4, 6, 10, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 144, 148, 152"
242,"The group had lied about one of them being out of town to avoid the meeting, but the professor discerned the truth and decided to deduct marks on the project.","The group consisted of five university students: John, Steve, Angela, James, and Susan. They were enrolled in a demanding course, and their success largely depended on a final group project. Despite the rigorous hours they put in, their group dynamics were lacking. James had an evasive attitude that made him unpopular among the group.

One day, the professor announced that he would be having an important meeting related to the project. James, yet again, was not keen on attending the meeting. The rest of the group, tired of his attitude, decided on a plan. They informed the professor that James was out of town due to a sudden family emergency, in hopes of avoiding a backlash for James' lack of commitment. They didn't want to lose precious marks over James' slack attitude.

However, little did they know, Professor Smith was a shrewd man. He held a distinct reputation for his knack for discerning the truth, often reminding his students, ""A lie has no legs to stand on.""

The day of the meeting arrived. The four of them entered the professor's office with a sense of uneasiness. The meeting went well, but something seemed amiss. It was when they were about to leave that the professor casually mentioned, ""I hope James is coping well with the family emergency.""

They gave a nod, trying to act nonchalant, but their faces turned pale. They wondered if the professor had discovered their lie. A few days later, their fears were confirmed. When they received their project feedback, the group was dismayed to discover that their marks had been significantly deducted.

In the comments section, the professor had written, ""Lack of integrity and honesty regarding group member's absence."" He had discerned the truth about their deception. It turned out; the professor had spotted James in the university cafeteria the same day they claimed he was out of town. 

The group realized their mistake. They had underestimated their professor and overestimated the strength of their lies. The incident served as a lesson to them about the importance of honesty. Moreover, it marked a turning point in James' attitude towards his work and his peers.","102,1,149,54,12,179,5,323,34,222,264,30,78,161,176,24,169,191,25,259,181,173,307,106,75,107,331,277,148,206,117,126,121,133,85,16,204,143,82,39,182,196,116,239,135,185,248,290,205,211,13,2,244,59,109,255,212,294,110,168,223,92,260,104,333,36,144,163,65,216,7,23,319,322,313,60,246,132,108,131,150,137,18,203,310,127,123,276,48,177,297,321,159,114,128,164,272,337,125,188,26,281,312,51,261,300,237,178,33,31,292,184,154,38,166,316,250,326,257,72,96,145,271,68,201,47,229,87,152,287,238,258,156,225,302,183,243,57,140,129,42,308,256,84,224,142,119,53,165,194,122,278,19,56,46,157,172,174,192,249,193,295,231,240,197,138,207,17,101,288,254,202,15,334,267,198,235,67,221,100,336,270,328,43,175,317,318,241,27,291,228,338,186,324,79,95,111,279,262,299","131,44,164,188,137","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
243,"For not submitting her homework on time, Amy falsely made up an excuse that her dog ate it but the professor decided to penalize her.","Amy was your typical college student: she was struggling to juggle her studies with her part-time job and extracurricular activities. On one particular Tuesday, Amy found herself in a dilemma. She had a 10-page term paper due for her Philosophy class, an assignment she had forgotten about until the day before the deadline.

She had spent the previous night at the library, trying her best to finish the paper. But fatigue coupled with her lack of understanding of the topic worked against her. Soon, it was 2 am, and she had only completed half of the paper. With an exhausted sigh, she decided to continue in the morning.

The next day, Amy woke up late. She rushed through her morning routine, darted out of her dorm, and arrived at her Philosophy class, her heart pounding. The professor, a stern old man named Dr. Sanders, was collecting the term papers.

Amy was aware that she had nothing to hand in. Panic welled inside her. Then, an idea dawned upon her. She decided to tell Dr. Sanders that her dog ate her homework. Surely he would sympathize with her and give her an extension?

With newfound hope, Amy approached Dr. Sanders. She mustered her courage and told him about the fabricated canine disaster. She put on her best distraught face and hoped that her well-rehearsed excuse would be enough to convince him.

But Dr. Sanders was no novice in his field. He had been teaching for over three decades and had heard every possible excuse from his students. His stern gaze remained unfazed by Amy's desperate plea.

He looked Amy straight in the eyes and simply said, ""Miss Wilson, I believe that excuse went out of fashion several decades ago. It's a lame excuse for not having done your work.""

Dr. Sanders then proceeded to inform Amy that she would be penalized for her late submission. Amy's heart sank as he continued to admonish her, reminding her of the importance of time management and the necessity of taking responsibility for her actions. Amy stood there, disheartened and slightly embarrassed, while her classmates stared, a few suppressing their giggles.

That day, Amy learned a valuable lesson. She recognized the need to better manage her time and prioritize her responsibilities. She also realized that honesty was indeed the best policy, as her made-up excuse not only failed to help her but also landed her in further trouble. She decided then and there to take responsibility for her actions and promised herself to never resort to false excuses again.

244,"He told his wife that he doesn’t want to rain on her parade, but they had to shift their vacation dates.","Richard had always cherished the gleam in his wife Laura's eyes when she planned their family vacations. Laura would spend weeks mapping out their route, deciding on places to explore, finding the best eateries, and booking the most comfortable hotels. Her commitment to ensuring a fulfilling and enjoyable vacation was one of the many reasons Richard fell in love with her.

This year, Laura had planned an elaborate vacation to Greece. She spent countless hours researching ancient ruins, the blue-domed churches of Santorini, and the romantic beaches of Mykonos. The excitement was quite palpable in the house. Both Richard and their two kids were eagerly looking forward to this holiday.

However, one day, Richard's office handed him an unexpected project with strict deadlines. The completion dates coincided with their planned vacation dates. It was a high-profile project, one that he couldn't delegate to others or postpone.

Richard was in a dilemma. He didn't want to disappoint his family, particularly Laura, who was brimming with joy and enthusiasm. At the same time, he knew he had a responsibility to his job.

After much thought, he decided he had to break the news to his family. That evening, he sat Laura down after dinner. He told his wife, ""I don't want to rain on your parade, but we have to shift our vacation dates.""

Laura, of course, was visibly disappointed. Her eyes lost the spark, and for a moment, Richard hated his job for making him do this. However, Laura quickly put on a brave face. She knew how important Richard's job was to him, and that he would not make such a request unless it was truly necessary.

The kids were a bit upset too, but Richard promised them that he would make it up to them. He assured them that they would still go to Greece, just a little later than planned.

Feeling a bit relieved, Richard thanked his wife and kids for understanding. He hated to spoil their excitement, but he knew they would understand.

Laura began the process of rescheduling. She contacted hotels, shifted bookings, and revised the itinerary. Despite the initial disappointment, she realized that these things happen and the most important thing was they were still going to have their family holiday.

Richard worked day and night on his project. On his end, he successfully completed the project within the deadline. Although it was tiring, Richard was proud of his team's achievement, and he eagerly looked forward to their rescheduled vacation.

Laura, Richard and their kids eventually embarked on their dream vacation to Greece. It was everything they had hoped for and more. They spent quality time as a family, made unforgettable memories, and learnt to navigate through the unexpected.

In the end, Richard's initial reluctance to rain on Laura's parade turned into a valuable lesson for the whole family. They learned the importance of flexibility, understanding and adapting to unexpected circumstances without losing the excitement of life's adventures.","180,267,206,217,289,228,309,9,179,266,50,79,168,1,72,287,68,196,293,185,3,294,275,235,201,102,66,136,272,18,21,137,204,303,186,260,15,74,229,170,224,53,337,300,252,24,163,52,207,133,59,126,55,195,257,173,124,192,193,249,327,106,105,285,36,141,209,143,76,328,187,213,245,281,88,135,155,247,149,296,325,83,13,154,11,98,264,259,312,200,218,118,7,234,314,315,63,310,86,101,160,311,4,181,144,90,210,75,263,269,322,243,40,147,221,94,117,157,216,165,60,197,246,54,211,17,0,87,80,232,336,151,61,273,153,255,45,253,71,291,125,332,92,270,334,283,112,56,109,290,156,331,25,132,47,145,313,58,131,227,241,199,111,242,134,184,69,122,5,49,317,298,226,73,329,46,16,280,276,236,97,212,162,140,29,274,67,301,308,178,248,166,64,278,96,321,57,223,164,70","73,123,78,191,60","1, 5, 16, 17, 27, 40, 64, 75, 84, 85, 98, 100, 114, 116, 118, 127, 140, 143, 145, 150, 151, 152, 155, 158, 164, 165, 167, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 182, 183, 184, 186, 187, 190, 195, 197, 199"
245,I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.,"As a chemistry professor at a reputed university, it was often my job to tackle tough situations. I've dealt with plenty of errors before, but none quite like this. In fact, today I was dreading a particular conversation more than any other. 

I called my star student, Andrew, into my office. He was brilliant, with an insatiable curiosity for all things science. He sat down across from me, looking at me expectantly with those bright eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.

I cleared my throat, feeling a pang of guilt. I had always believed in his capabilities; his hard work and dedication were apparent. He had a deep love for chemistry, which had earned him the highest grade - an A.

""Andrew,"" I began, feeling the weight of what I was about to say. His face instantly fell. He had always been perceptive; he probably knew that this wasn’t an ordinary conversation.

""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error,"" I finally said, my voice barely more than a whisper.

The silence that hung in the air was deafening. Andrew's face dropped as the realization sank in. The A he had been so proud of was just a blunder. 

""Wh-what do you mean?"" he stammered, looking utterly lost.

""I mean, you didn't earn an A,"" I continued, swallowing the lump in my throat. I had the job of crushing his dream, and it felt nothing short of a punishment.

""But I worked hard...,"" his voice trailed off, a look of utter disbelief spreading across his face. I could see him mentally revisiting all the long hours he spent pouring over chemistry books, carrying out complex experiments and staying up late to finish assignments.

""Yes, you did,"" I assured him. ""And your hard work didn't go unnoticed. But there was an error in the grading. It seems you got a B.""

A B was still above average, but in Andrew's eyes, it was a failure. This was a young man who had built his world around the idea of excellence, and I just shattered it.

For a while, he said nothing. He just stared blankly at the floor, trying to comprehend the news. Eventually, he thanked me and left my office, his footsteps echoing against the cold, hard floor.

That evening, I couldn't help but reflect on the situation. It was an unfortunate mistake, but Andrew's commitment to chemistry was undeniably strong. Despite the shock, I knew he would bounce back. In fact, this could be the motivation he needed to become an even better chemist.","134,163,151,131,116,53,281,23,295,101,49,62,5,138,0,229,14,279,270,61,128,155,11,269,282,250,67,115,263,159,280,143,145,81,162,265,41,44,182,157,207,35,18,220,38,153,322,243,56,88,261,206,224,330,336,186,135,136,29,164,69,17,47,178,104,60,189,204,46,132,42,79,146,22,219,188,161,247,121,93,254,313,66,100,83,246,144,249,150,120,99,105,227,25,191,335,244,139,19,276,232,30,187,40,262,43,166,339,112,65,289,274,235,97,140,286,110,92,57,302,259,197,12,251,165,240,236,137,4,283,91,87,267,221,248,304,167,7,59,258,223,237,314,241,20,217,310,183,253,209,185,58,94,305,107,196,338,273,48,122,194,85,15,90,64,293,266,89,102,129,71,213,82,210,50,127,173,271,169,98,331,126,9,96,211,332,130,152,216,133,242,218,285,298,315,198,149,177,201,31","97,86,78,135,88","1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
246,I'm sorry to disappoint you but you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist!.,"The music pulsed loudly, pumping out a rhythm that made the walls of the mansion shudder in response. Bright lights swirled and danced, illuminating the opulence of the well-decorated party held within. People were laughing and mingling, flutes of champagne in hand as they moved with the music. A regular event, this was known as the most exclusive party in town, a mecca for the city's elite.

John stood at the entrance, his heart pounding in sync with the music. He had been to this party many times before, becoming a regular fixture and a well-known figure among the party goers. His sense of excitement, however, took a sudden hit when he was stopped by the imposing bouncer who was guarding the entrance.

""I'm sorry to disappoint you,"" the bouncer started, peering down at him through dark sunglasses, his expression unreadable. He held out a hand, stopping John in his tracks. ""But you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist.""

John's mind went blank for a second, shock rippling through him. It had to be some kind of mistake. He had always behaved appropriately at these parties, never causing any disturbances or troubles.

He tried to argue with the bouncer, ""There must be some mistake! Check again!""

The bouncer simply shook his head, pointing towards a tablet that listed the names of those who were denied entrance. John's name was right there, beside a glowing red cross. 

""There's no mistake. You're not getting in tonight, or any other night,"" the bouncer said, his voice carrying the weight of finality.

Humiliation washed over John as people around began to notice the commotion, whispers of his predicament quickly spreading through the crowd. He didn't know what he could have possibly done to deserve such a drastic punishment. The realization that he was now an outcast from the one place where he felt welcomed was a blow to his ego.

His mind began to race, thinking back to the previous parties, trying to identify a moment of indiscretion, a wrong step that could have caused his sudden banishment. But nothing came to his mind. He was polite, friendly, and well-mannered. He couldn't understand why he had been blacklisted.

With a deep sigh, he took one last longing look at the lively party going on without him. The lights looked harsher, the music sounded more distorted and the crowd suddenly seemed less friendly. He turned around, the weight of rejection heavy on his shoulders, and began to walk away. 

Suddenly, his once favorite party felt like an alien world, one he was no longer part of. Each step he took away from the music and laughter felt like a slow descent into loneliness, making him yearn for a reality he was forcibly removed from.

That night, the parties in the city went on, the revelry uninterrupted by the one less party-goer. And John, once the life of every party, found himself on the outside, looking in.","45,240,313,37,93,314,112,280,324,196,258,113,35,18,318,250,242,103,175,81,111,236,254,58,161,3,267,305,338,307,245,46,189,178,281,330,177,95,298,283,262,121,304,217,118,184,79,166,226,275,30,162,228,172,54,120,122,87,276,333,322,21,279,136,294,205,289,301,295,251,74,43,155,127,157,309,210,119,105,66,192,247,2,8,268,146,140,85,145,167,202,287,317,139,332,249,82,320,248,142,55,206,323,159,97,308,235,214,211,102,80,195,143,89,233,219,92,186,311,109,199,285,52,165,48,153,176,62,23,94,108,213,300,29,328,90,325,15,28,64,34,77,86,244,306,185,339,88,297,257,117,38,9,76,63,36,160,68,57,49,207,209,72,239,101,337,10,255,302,261,44,133,326,5,174,144,6,13,266,203,327,271,60,73,216,241,173,33,53,171,190,212,156,193,310,123,0,39,19,12","144,31,82,99,96","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
247,"I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation.","I was sitting in the tiny cubicle I called my workspace, counting the minutes until the end of the day. I had spent countless weeks preparing for the vacation of a lifetime, meticulously planning every detail. Each plane ticket had been painstakingly reviewed, every booking double-checked. 

The piles of paperwork were stacked high on my desk, a testament to the grueling preparation that had preceded this moment. I had meticulously completed all my pending tasks and informed my boss about my upcoming absence. He had initially agreed without any reservations, and I was all set for my dream vacation.

My heart pounded with anticipation. I could practically feel the tropical sun on my skin, taste the exotic food I'd have the chance to try, hear the surf crashing against the sandy shores. The vision of this long-awaited vacation seemed to make the dreariness of my everyday office life more bearable.

Suddenly, the dreaded email notification pinged on my laptop. It was a message from my boss. The first line itself sent a chilling wave of fear down my spine: ""I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation.""

I was shell-shocked. His email explained that a significant client wanted to review our progress before the end of the week, right when I was supposed to embark on my vacation. There was no one else capable of delivering the presentation as it was based on my work. There was no way out. The dream I had been nurturing was shattering into a thousand pieces right before my eyes.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. It was an enormous letdown. I could feel my tropical sun fading and being replaced by the harsh fluorescent lights of the conference room. The taste of the exotic food turned bitter in my imagination, overpowered by the taste of cold, stale office coffee. My surf sounds were replaced by the monotonous drone of office chatter.

But then I pulled myself together. I reminded myself that my career was as essential as my vacation. After all, it was my job that had afforded me the luxury of such a vacation. I emailed my boss back, agreeing to prepare the presentation.

Over the next few days, I worked tirelessly. I had a deadline to meet, and I was determined not to let this setback ruin my vacation entirely. I put my heart and soul into the presentation, striving to make it the best it could possibly be.

When the day of the presentation arrived, I held my head high and walked into the conference room. I could tell that my hard work had paid off. The client seemed impressed, and my boss was satisfied.

Despite the last-minute hiccup, I was finally free to go on vacation. My disappointment had turned into a triumph, teaching me that sometimes obstacles can lead to even more significant victories.","100,97,161,39,87,208,98,206,207,154,331,277,24,91,44,18,42,13,15,158,336,124,168,199,313,25,319,223,55,130,110,312,143,201,287,191,169,58,77,0,162,137,64,236,139,7,250,57,117,270,195,315,108,316,104,264,218,99,29,43,151,249,203,5,103,171,62,20,194,269,149,68,152,184,215,240,118,301,107,30,293,273,282,32,289,221,267,231,286,285,281,12,333,180,119,96,238,155,211,17,23,89,164,305,244,310,26,257,220,265,140,329,49,136,134,332,138,101,150,186,129,121,306,115,38,105,80,222,228,86,34,21,337,324,94,266,290,205,328,304,170,193,37,19,224,261,302,248,213,246,70,294,311,176,245,50,27,230,175,47,229,192,106,92,255,262,271,78,31,210,334,234,41,288,60,127,323,291,59,318,272,153,219,102,28,167,147,14,45,226,308,11,233,196,179,165,111,253,135,71","105,155,150,148,62","1, 5, 27, 32, 34, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 54, 57, 63, 65, 69, 70, 72, 77, 78, 84, 86, 88, 95, 96, 98, 99, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
248,The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees.,"John Addison, CEO of a small software development company, finalized his review of the annual financial report late in the night. To his dismay, the revenue shortfall that year was worse than he had anticipated. He knew he had a grave responsibility, and an even graver announcement to make to his employees. It was holiday season, and the staff had been looking forward to their traditional holiday bonus.

The next morning, John arrived at the office earlier than usual. He walked around the cubicles, watching as his dedicated employees hurried to finish their tasks. They were enthusiastic, unwavering in their diligence and optimism, oblivious to the looming news. He thought about the hopes and dreams they'd be holding for their bonuses. It might be for a family vacation, paying off a loan, a special gift for a loved one, or saving it for a rainy day.

Determined not to let this news dampen their spirit, John decided to address his employees himself, instead of delegating the task to his HR manager. Gathering his thoughts, he asked everyone to assemble in the conference room. A hush fell over the room as the usually jovial CEO stood before them with a somber look on his face.

John began to talk about the company's annual performance, walking them through the highs and lows of the year. He acknowledged the unanticipated financial crunch the company had faced, but praised their collective hard work and dedication despite the hurdles. He felt a knot in his stomach as he neared the announcement.

With a heavy heart, he dropped the bomb: there would be no holiday bonuses this year due to the financial setbacks. He could see the shock and disappointment on his employees' faces; it was a tough pill to swallow.

Despite their initial surprise, John's heartfelt explanation and his own evident disappointment lessened the blow. He was apologetic and sincere, and his employees could see that. He promised to compensate them as soon as the company was back on track.

At that moment, the company was more than a business entity, it felt like a family sharing good times and hardships. John's transparent communication, although bitter, had earned him respect among his employees.

In the days that followed, the office was not as cheerful as it had been before the announcement, but work resumed as usual. The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. Yet, it was clear that their unity and spirit were stronger than ever. John knew that their resilience would eventually pay off, the company would bounce back, and he would ensure his employees received their well-deserved bonus.","145,243,254,155,162,312,13,213,245,120,246,177,194,327,311,33,333,278,84,280,238,210,339,170,68,255,174,198,221,59,20,332,247,189,153,244,242,295,58,44,300,183,190,192,305,229,219,9,326,214,142,23,272,36,83,69,96,290,212,140,293,273,6,38,270,321,199,315,232,186,74,18,286,149,98,105,165,34,47,279,26,146,335,187,0,70,289,205,302,40,207,182,95,29,66,336,329,271,136,27,32,61,5,287,331,249,11,256,200,236,299,64,227,196,104,25,310,151,8,158,141,99,275,288,252,328,172,62,281,49,274,76,135,87,259,112,297,330,250,115,188,208,166,231,2,72,201,216,117,10,282,222,116,313,296,157,338,132,181,79,215,102,139,31,94,191,131,193,39,147,103,85,53,17,266,15,206,133,258,100,168,318,3,42,138,334,24,57,203,237,235,197,45,320,264,19,303,152,304,225","36,9,11,33,106","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
249,I do not want to spoil your mood but I have to babysit my nephew today.,"I’m usually not the one to bring mood-killing news, especially on such a glorious day, but this time I have no choice. There was something I had to tell you, something that might change our plans a bit. I didn't want to spoil your mood, but I had to share it. It's about my nephew, he is just five and quite a handful. His mother, my sister, had called me early in the morning.

""Could you please watch over him today?"" she had pleaded on the call. After a moment's hesitation, I agreed. I couldn't let my sister down, not when she sounded so desperate. You should know that she rarely asked for favors, especially concerning her child. She is one of those strong, independent women we always talk about and admire.

So when she said she needed help, I knew it must be serious. I didn't ask her why or what happened, that would come later when we met. All she said was that she needed to leave town for an emergency. I respected her privacy and promised to look after my nephew.

My concern now was our plan for the day. We had been planning this outing for weeks now, just you and me. A whole day together, away from our regular schedule, meant to be filled with fun and laughter. How we had been looking forward to it! But life is unpredictable, isn't it?

I had thought about calling to cancel, or to ask if we could bring my nephew along. The former seemed like an unjust thing to do, the latter, a potential disaster. My nephew, as much as I love him, can be quite a tornado. Taking him to a serene outing didn't seem like a feasible idea.

That's why I am telling you this now, in person. I need you to understand the situation, not just hear about it over a call. I know you were looking forward to today as much as I was. Your radiant smile and sparkling eyes always told me so. I do not want to spoil your mood, but I have to babysit my nephew today. 

I really hope you don't get too disappointed. I wanted to make this day special, for you and me. But duty calls, and when it does, we have to respond. I wish there was a way to merge our plans with my new responsibility. If you could think of something, your creativity is always beyond mine, that would be great.

But if that's not the case, I hope you will understand and we can plan something else soon. I guess that's the unpredictability of life, don't you think?","184,128,40,164,44,72,238,20,64,138,74,183,281,148,91,186,299,155,207,71,83,61,65,82,313,66,275,129,166,118,268,67,336,169,120,221,29,154,28,21,243,233,45,202,273,244,284,23,257,106,200,53,159,59,111,203,33,309,170,301,227,318,330,24,210,49,41,262,323,149,264,62,261,321,303,192,76,48,240,79,123,259,237,13,228,147,46,263,248,51,283,168,6,246,256,334,239,5,258,17,78,317,105,43,139,234,245,226,135,39,300,235,304,174,63,265,291,292,92,15,173,68,81,293,288,312,162,198,328,140,194,11,241,10,117,266,47,290,337,324,152,160,146,254,316,212,158,109,80,211,287,102,14,252,113,90,73,86,110,251,124,1,191,150,175,88,247,322,204,197,178,107,103,236,278,302,101,96,4,274,319,7,271,172,134,12,165,196,218,311,231,332,104,190,108,209,167,171,298,188","46,107,94,167,89","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
250,She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?.,"Robert was a New Yorker through and through. He loved his city with all its lights and chaos and had never found a need to venture beyond it, or even to engage in the politics of other states. He had his own borough to worry about.

One day, he was sitting at his favorite coffee shop in Brooklyn, engrossing himself in the latest issue of his favorite newspaper, The New York Times, when a woman walked in. She was medium-height, with neatly cropped brunette hair and a sense of confidence that commanded the room. Her sharp eyes scanned the coffee shop, finally landing on Robert's table. With a warm smile, she started walking towards him.

Robert looked up from his newspaper and was surprised to see the unknown woman approaching. She extended her hand and introduced herself as Angela. Confused, Robert shook her hand, but his puzzled expression didn't escape Angela's notice.

""You don't recognize me, do you?"" Angela asked, amusement tinging her voice. Robert shook his head honestly, causing Angela to laugh. She seemed to find his ignorance hilarious, which made him feel uncomfortable and a little annoyed.

At the next table, a young man who had overheard their conversation intervened. ""She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?"" He asked, shaking his head disbelievingly at Robert.

Robert was taken aback. He looked at Angela again, this time with more attention. Suddenly, her face started to make sense. He had seen her on TV, in newspapers, and on the internet. He blushed slightly, embarrassed for not recognizing her.

""Oh! I'm so sorry, Representative,"" Robert began, but Angela interrupted him with a wave of her hand.

""No need for formalities, Robert. Call me Angela,"" she said with a smile. Robert was pleasantly surprised by her down-to-earth demeanor. It was not something he expected from someone of her stature. 

They began to talk, Angela sharing her experiences in California and asking Robert about life in New York. Despite the unconventional beginning, they found common ground in their love for their respective cities. Angela's laughter filled the coffee shop, and Robert found himself enjoying her company.

Their conversation continued into the late afternoon, moving from politics to movies, food, and personal experiences. By the end of the day, Robert had learned not only about Angela the Representative but also Angela the person.

That day, Robert didn't just meet a Representative from California, he made a new friend. He was reminded that titles didn't define individuals. And perhaps, most importantly, he was reminded of the importance of recognizing the people who made a difference, no matter how far away they might be.","186,197,200,79,260,34,280,67,121,275,268,27,213,24,162,23,249,101,276,14,192,263,314,310,289,236,141,133,303,179,20,87,279,21,288,226,307,295,335,75,182,47,278,329,16,251,156,204,206,332,265,37,138,225,115,311,146,220,81,273,212,302,114,196,224,104,73,255,169,325,256,3,150,241,63,134,144,247,193,209,205,227,232,51,129,320,221,161,117,218,68,333,188,148,89,189,168,36,239,9,177,17,231,88,143,107,229,69,184,98,214,257,252,159,199,142,49,152,293,131,48,1,61,155,99,215,120,298,13,180,59,240,64,292,119,38,160,337,55,258,264,165,78,294,246,190,299,0,125,176,304,111,234,158,326,29,105,135,62,316,208,41,50,94,163,290,2,287,323,277,312,18,91,254,170,175,122,164,181,93,58,334,253,39,43,235,19,237,44,70,113,11,90,270,282,95,305,324,136,171","46,113,183,174,68","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
251,Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.,"Carol sat comfortably in the crowded sports bar, engaged in a lively conversation with her friends. It was a Tuesday evening, the night after a long Monday workday and an excellent time to relax and unwind. Suddenly, the light banter was interrupted by the loud chatters at the end of the room. Turning her head in the direction of the uproar, she noticed a tall man surrounded by a throng of people, fumbling with a burger.

“Who's that guy over there?” Carol asked her friend Jenny, pointing towards the tall, noticeable figure. Jenny squinted her eyes to get a good look and shrugged, “I'm not sure, seems like someone famous, I guess.” 

Her curiosity piqued, Carol decided to get a closer look. She walked toward the man, managing to wiggle her way through the crowd. Once closer, she noticed the distinguished features of the man, an aura of authority and control that instantly held her attention. His eyes were focused on the large screens projecting the basketball game, a half-eaten burger in his hand.

Suddenly, someone from the crowd asked loudly, ""Don't you know who that is?"" Everyone looked puzzled, exchanging curious glances amongst each other. The man asking the question looked shocked and continued, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

An awkward silence followed his declaration, and then the room burst into laughter. It seemed too ludicrous to believe; the idea of the most influential man in the country, in their local sports bar, eating a burger while watching a game, was surreal.

However, the man just smiled sheepishly, an aura of modesty replacing the one of authority. He stood up and confirmed, ""Yes, I am the president. I wanted a normal evening out."" The crowd seemed stunned.

The president took this opportunity to engage in light-hearted conversation with the people around him, answering their amused questions about his burger preference and his favorite basketball team. The bar staff, amazed and excited, rushed to serve him better.

Carol, standing there bewildered, felt an overwhelming sense of amusement and respect towards the man. Here he was, the most powerful man, choosing to spend his free evening like any other American. It was a sight to behold.

By the time she returned to her table, Jenny was dying to know about the mysterious man. Carol, with a broad smile, replied, ""Guess what, Jenny? You were right. He is someone famous, indeed. He's the president of the United States!"" Jenny's eyes widened, and the table erupted with laughter and surprise.

That Tuesday evening was definitely not a typical one, providing a tale they would all share for years to come. The night they watched a basketball game with the president of the United States in their local sports bar.","57,46,190,158,207,164,122,290,8,184,73,12,58,321,149,183,265,339,291,233,96,78,239,232,90,144,61,34,14,103,317,68,332,314,235,106,303,176,189,4,175,165,108,13,243,2,310,42,252,62,193,107,152,79,19,146,160,48,272,89,316,276,320,202,109,245,219,80,210,288,200,295,134,140,186,54,236,301,185,178,204,282,150,141,263,229,145,143,292,330,163,15,170,220,93,319,336,250,0,74,266,278,215,253,213,322,302,299,228,167,142,123,280,137,271,31,127,45,198,53,162,154,234,298,254,161,86,260,256,121,3,286,133,181,324,100,30,95,214,66,9,267,329,153,60,67,82,255,130,49,305,29,241,91,274,208,258,191,28,169,205,182,119,227,259,223,94,168,120,248,337,112,97,166,285,270,206,242,50,237,244,56,151,257,201,212,217,230,327,70,10,64,279,209,129,238,296,273,63,47","98,49,104,125,148","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99"
252,I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive.,"I was at my usual spot, in my local sports bar, sipping on a chilled pint when the conversation veered towards football. I found myself in conversation with a young woman, who seemed unfamiliar with the sporting world. As our conversation unfolded, I found myself utterly shocked as she casually mentioned, ""Who is Cristiano Ronaldo?""

I nearly choked on my drink, ""I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is!"" I exclaimed incredulously. She looked at me quizzically as I waved my arm emphatically. ""He is one of the greatest football players alive,"" I informed her, as I took another sip of my drink.

She merely shrugged as I launched into a passionate account of Ronaldo's achievements. ""Born in Portugal, Ronaldo started his career with Sporting Lisbon before moving on to Manchester United,"" I began. Her eyes widened as I spoke about his numerous accomplishments and how he'd won the Premier League thrice with the club.

""Following his success at Manchester, he moved on to Real Madrid, where he became an absolute legend. He won four Champions League titles with them and became the club's all-time top scorer,"" I continued. I explained his transfer to Juventus, where he was presently playing and scoring regularly.

I spoke of his prowess on the international stage too. ""He's Portugal's all-time top scorer and has won the European Championship with them,"" I pointed out. I described his enviable physique, rigorous training regimen, and his exceptional skills, which included a keen eye for goals, dribbling, and free-kicks.

Although I wasn't sure if my explanation had given justice to Ronaldo's greatness, I passionately expressed my admiration. I made an effort to convey his unfathomable athletic skills, altruism off the pitch, his ambition to remain at the top even after a decade of unparalleled success.

As I recounted his numerous individual awards - five Ballon d'Or awards, four Golden Shoes, being named the best player in the world several times - she was obviously overwhelmed. She confessed that she had indeed heard of Ronaldo but did not comprehend his stature in the world of football until now.

By the time our conversation ended, her face beamed with newfound understanding and respect. She admitted that she had underestimated football as a sport and its players. Her ignorance, she claimed, stemmed from her lack of interest and exposure, which she was now determined to amend.

As I bid her goodnight, I couldn't help but smirk, feeling proud of my successful attempt at enlightening someone about the world of football, specifically about the legendary Cristiano Ronaldo, undeniably one of the greatest players alive.","10,339,203,220,259,109,285,319,271,245,165,267,268,305,108,240,238,32,269,111,242,187,98,34,330,128,89,273,33,230,26,76,79,263,12,163,101,105,167,95,84,118,215,180,120,232,318,178,61,91,332,86,43,311,102,258,239,193,216,326,337,302,247,138,328,65,157,47,16,222,148,5,154,278,195,310,100,301,20,248,132,172,44,31,300,151,113,122,145,96,9,125,18,83,261,149,143,58,123,146,315,139,50,186,325,314,227,152,49,53,99,35,42,144,93,293,0,106,6,155,80,169,126,127,209,75,277,21,196,119,59,312,237,56,192,299,257,292,104,334,7,133,57,39,289,117,243,72,197,23,70,253,320,327,166,135,274,129,36,295,184,121,94,62,82,73,221,251,198,194,17,218,304,219,153,317,297,241,52,107,115,134,223,40,69,236,321,282,249,15,171,46,250,264,270,255,87,110,324,254","193,168,152,200,196","1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
253,Show some respect to your professor! He is a legend in his field.,"As the lecture wrapped up, students rushed out of the large auditorium, each of them eager to start the weekend. Among them was a young man named Jordan, known for his confident demeanor but also for his blatant disregard for authority. Jordan turned to his friend Mike, rolling his eyes and scoffing loudly, ""Professor Williams and his dull theories. I can't believe we have to listen to his rambling every week.""

His friend Mike stopped in his tracks, his face firm and serious as he replied, ""Jordan, show some respect to your professor! He is a legend in his field.""

Jordan frowned, confused. ""A legend?"" he asked. ""How do you figure that?""

""Well,"" Mike began, ""Firstly, do you know he was a pioneer in developing computational algorithms in the late 1980s?""

Jordan shrugged nonchalantly, displaying little interest in the matter. Mike continued, undeterred, describing Professor Williams's remarkable achievements. He talked about the professor’s key role in cracking previously unsolvable mathematical problems. 

""His work is used in cryptography, helping to keep our data safe. He's contributed significantly to machine learning, making computers better at understanding and predicting human behavior,"" Mike explained. Jordan began to look a little taken aback.

Furthermore, Mike continued, ""His research has been used in climate modelling, helping scientists predict and understand climate change.""

As Mike unveiled the illustrious career of Professor Williams, students around them started to listen. A small crowd formed as they listened to tales of Professor Williams's groundbreaking research and accolades.

""The algorithms he invented are part of the software we use every day. In our computers, our smartphones, even in our cars,"" Mike added. Jordan was visibly taken aback, his previous confidence faltering. His perception of the humble, unassuming professor started to change.

After Mike finished recounting the professor's achievements, a respectful silence fell over the small crowd that had gathered. Jordan was left contemplative, his initial judgement of Professor Williams upended. 

From that day, Jordan began to see Professor Williams not just as a rambling old man, but as a legend in his field, a pioneer who shaped the very technology they were studying. Jordan not only started to respect him, but he also started to appreciate his lectures, understanding the immense value of the knowledge being shared.

Even in the university halls, whispers of the professor’s accolitudes spread, earning him the respect he deserved. And all this because someone chose to recognize a legend in his field and to insist, ""Show some respect to your professor!""","146,112,69,276,14,41,293,236,329,256,173,111,96,51,28,74,310,302,32,283,290,294,238,73,21,113,286,58,306,281,250,34,335,59,126,138,196,124,115,188,308,224,26,114,252,132,52,169,304,334,4,155,205,39,127,104,81,229,79,137,279,121,200,230,178,5,123,254,33,206,247,103,339,227,107,116,207,161,102,295,260,288,208,46,234,203,80,133,152,44,198,172,177,7,38,100,195,193,141,83,244,64,303,49,181,297,192,167,245,91,275,175,273,125,282,143,183,336,136,259,269,89,267,241,268,168,211,180,284,296,174,47,71,318,48,11,128,323,237,30,222,87,271,68,215,313,258,105,149,106,109,255,154,278,22,243,307,249,298,139,300,90,66,202,54,118,144,326,145,182,213,333,53,157,232,84,131,262,201,316,274,166,23,272,160,20,86,159,251,176,70,119,242,194,280,325,50,219,270,65","31,189,45,68,152","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
254,He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.,"Once upon a time, in the vibrant heart of New York City, lived a man named Carter. Music ran through Carter's veins like blood, and his heart constantly tapped out the rhythm of rap. He was exceptionally talented, with a unique flair for penning lyrics that resonated with the souls of millions. His words had the power to ignite revolutions, bring comfort to the lonely, and challenge the status quo. Carter was not just a mere rapper; to people, he was the god of rap.

He had attained the highest honor in the music industry, not once, but thrice. Yes, Carter was the winner of three prestigious Grammy awards. It wasn't for some petty achievement, no. Each of these was for his inimitable contributions to the world of music. Each Grammy he held was a testament to his devotion, an ode to his persistence, and an acknowledgement of his unparalleled talent.

His first Grammy came as a surprise. Carter was still an emerging rapper, and the industry giants did not expect such a fiery comet to blaze through. However, his debut album shook everyone's preconceptions, marking the arrival of a new rap god. His tracks resonated with the masses; his poignant words tearing through the hearts of his audience. That Grammy was his ticket to stardom. 

The second Grammy followed soon after, and this time, it was for his breathtaking lyrics. Carter became renowned for his razor-sharp wit and intricate rhymes that held profound messages. This award was not just his, but also belonged to the thousands of fans who found solace and strength in his words. It was through his music that they found the courage to face their deepest fears and rise above their struggles. 

As for the third Grammy, it arrived during a challenging period in Carter's life. He had reached a point of saturation and felt like his creative reservoir was running dry. He wrestled with self-doubt and questioned his ability to keep producing profound music. But amidst the tumult, he managed to pen an album that was raw, vulnerable, and exceedingly beautiful. When he won the Grammy for this album, it was a personal victory, and a validation that indeed, his work was still profoundly impactful. 

Yes, he was the winner of three Grammy awards, and for God's sake, each had a story to tell. His music was not just notes strung together or words flowing in rhythm, it was a symphony of emotions resonating with everyone who listened. People didn't just consider Carter to be a gifted rapper; they revered him as the god of rap. His words were the gospel they followed, his rhythm the heartbeat they danced to. 

And so, through struggle and triumph, through doubt and conviction, through joy and sorrow, Carter lived his life. A life where his words shaped narratives and his music built bridges. A life where he wasn't just a man but a legend, and not just a rapper but the god of rap.","326,288,320,113,302,67,137,227,294,247,38,165,179,3,229,17,166,53,47,311,285,246,105,329,93,1,250,49,65,51,284,23,133,235,242,291,161,95,117,73,324,100,265,327,86,338,62,118,115,121,219,110,168,127,12,262,14,92,197,58,191,13,31,264,183,69,71,104,96,97,8,220,263,260,146,280,253,91,178,196,102,162,132,176,81,164,248,215,167,236,283,88,290,42,154,182,78,75,298,147,82,310,106,44,66,151,231,175,55,301,144,276,228,135,279,211,89,286,325,6,109,180,99,258,148,275,299,37,306,266,319,25,271,203,24,222,249,230,131,313,16,163,150,157,314,226,296,68,112,56,152,304,136,292,177,318,274,155,18,114,173,336,139,54,160,74,255,174,140,32,101,202,281,251,172,239,124,270,45,22,252,63,208,307,41,4,7,272,221,245,198,48,330,11,149,84,129,256,19,184","27,174,181,77,167","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
255,Do you know who you're facing? That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!.,"John was always a cocky one, always ready for a challenge no matter what it was. He had never lost in a taekwondo match before, so his confidence levels had shot through the roof. But the onlookers wondered if he knew what he was getting himself into this time. 

""Do you know who you're facing?"" The voice echoed through the silent auditorium. The speaker, a stout, middle-aged man, stood on the edge of the taekwondo ring with a look of grave seriousness on his face.

The spectators glanced anxiously at each other, some murmuring in hushed whispers. John's taekwondo coach, an old master with graying hair and firm eyes, nodded in acknowledgment. His gaze swept over the opponent standing opposite John.

""That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!"" He announced, pointing towards the individual in question. The crowd erupted into gasps and nervous murmurs, while John's confident grin faltered slightly.

This opponent was different from his past adversaries. He was tall, muscular, with a determined look on his face that radiated intensity and focus. His posture was that of a true professional, a stark contrast to the younger and more inexperienced fighters John had previously faced.

John's eyes flickered with apprehension but his competitive nature overpowered any lingering fear. Despite this revelation, he didn't back down. His fierce determination replaced the uncertainty in his eyes, his firm resolve earning him a smattering of applause from the audience.

His opponent, the world champion, merely smirked. He had been in John's shoes before, faced with an adversary that seemed unbeatable. He respected the spark he saw in John's eyes, the same spark that had driven him to his own success.

As they both got into their starting positions, the tension in the air was palpable. The crowd held their breaths, the hush transforming the auditorium into a battlefield of anticipation. The referee signaled the start of the match, and it was as though time slowed down.

The fight was a spectacular display of skill and technique. John, fueled by a desire to prove himself, was relentless. Yet, the world champion displayed the experience and prowess that had earned him his title. The match was intense and by no means one-sided.

Eventually, John was defeated but not before giving the world champion a run for his money. He walked off the mat, bruised and battered, but with a sense of accomplishment. He had faced the world champion of taekwondo, an experience that would forever shape his martial arts journey.","163,9,53,136,215,83,147,168,311,245,295,252,222,268,256,198,210,220,314,196,38,339,302,160,254,273,177,233,249,115,138,105,332,134,120,33,321,25,318,91,267,250,328,207,279,165,162,31,304,175,16,197,2,113,140,121,117,68,200,201,97,289,19,307,258,241,287,170,144,111,291,299,59,226,224,47,317,42,229,55,26,282,271,234,253,141,85,290,239,308,243,185,202,10,238,337,334,96,212,8,145,82,178,109,90,320,45,313,69,3,232,149,78,4,142,139,79,330,297,266,100,248,272,128,24,154,240,324,278,62,93,164,205,264,300,56,107,18,108,39,219,14,0,40,206,277,41,265,269,116,173,30,6,21,17,29,221,46,199,193,309,217,263,95,259,37,281,127,329,35,106,50,228,285,326,172,305,167,303,180,34,211,63,129,148,143,70,274,98,184,5,80,323,125,260,225,251,182,132,65","42,197,12,85,25","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
256,"She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.","Maria had always been one to trust her instincts, and for a while, those instincts had been screaming at her. She'd started to notice little inconsistencies in James's stories. It started with small things, like who he'd said he was having lunch with or what time he had come home from work. Gradually, though, the inconsistencies grew, like a small patch of mold that, left unchecked, was slowly spreading across their entire relationship.

At first, Maria ignored the nagging feeling that something was off. She told herself that it was just stress. James was a lawyer, so he had a lot on his plate. It was understandable if he mixed up a few details here and there. But soon, the small inconsistencies started to pile up, and ignoring them became harder.

James would make hasty retreats into his office when his phone rang, coming back looking sheepishly guilty. He started spending late nights at work and even weekends, which was unusual for him. There was a scent of a different perfume on his suits, a scent that didn't belong to Maria. And then there were the credit card receipts for expensive dinners she never attended, the jewelry she never wore, and the sudden influx of overnight business trips.

One evening, Maria confronted James. He seemed surprised, but immediately his face morphed into a reassuring smile. James had an explanation for everything. The calls were from clients, the late nights were due to a big case, the perfume was a colleague's he'd lent his coat to, and the receipts? Gifts for her that he was planning to surprise her with. It was all perfectly plausible, but Maria knew. 

However, Maria chose to turn a blind eye to it all. Their life together was too comfortable to shatter. They had built a beautiful home together, were respected in their community, and after so many years together, they had a rhythm that Maria wasn't ready to disrupt. Admitting the truth would cause an upheaval she didn't think she could handle.

She knew James was lying to her. She could see it in his eyes every time he fabricated another tale to cover his tracks. But she decided to ignore her gut feeling. If she didn't confront the truth, then it didn't exist. That's what she told herself, as she went about her day, living a lie that was more comfortable than reality.

But even as she buried the truth, a part of Maria ached. Every lie he told, every cover story he concocted, drove a wedge deeper between them. Yet, Maria continued to play the doting wife, choosing to ignore the glaring signs of betrayal, all the while dreaming of a time when their love was pure and untainted by deceit.","17,206,278,315,257,12,137,7,79,279,4,285,132,196,99,37,307,113,108,51,327,281,78,36,202,289,47,63,190,223,185,150,335,148,72,295,328,308,199,204,93,274,24,252,334,80,258,250,228,303,254,140,313,30,102,300,276,210,213,14,10,297,230,262,19,101,181,48,110,13,266,286,174,269,22,156,75,302,1,317,172,16,56,227,124,310,187,322,173,5,115,249,194,275,205,324,129,117,49,71,243,8,39,267,284,18,109,239,151,234,139,177,198,291,326,154,89,128,305,312,46,311,164,130,32,255,268,155,127,112,225,182,294,282,183,261,145,38,119,143,259,27,193,306,84,120,301,2,247,98,251,244,296,203,280,218,216,214,264,161,125,221,67,217,260,106,134,11,34,42,83,126,141,299,100,323,220,25,59,153,332,333,273,138,219,314,337,60,166,321,298,104,52,215,241,29,277,77,186,158","5,47,141,165,136","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
257,"Garry knows he is underpaid, but he chooses not to focus on it as he is more than happy to have a job.","Garry Baxter was a man of simple tastes and needs, a man who was content with the little he had. He worked as a janitor at a large corporate building downtown. Every day, he arrived at work earlier than anyone else, prepared to tackle the grime and mess left behind by hundreds of office workers. Despite his efforts, he was always at the bottom of the company's salary scale, earning just enough to scrape by.

Garry knew he was underpaid. He was aware that he earned less than his colleagues doing the same job in different companies. It was the unspoken truth; no one wanted to admit it, but everyone knew about it. Yet, Garry never complained. He never made a fuss, nor did he protest about his meager paycheck. His stoic acceptance was often mistaken for ignorance.

But the truth was, he wasn't ignorant about his pay situation. He knew how unfair it was, but he was the kind of man who saw the bright side of everything. For Garry, the silver lining was the fact that he had a job, a blessing many people in the world did not have.

He believed in valuing what he had, rather than cribbing about what he didn’t. His salary, although small, was enough for him to meet his needs, and that mattered more than anything else. Garry had seen times when he had been jobless, wrestling with unemployment and struggling to pay his bills. He knew what it felt like to have nothing, and so he valued everything he had now, even if it wasn't much by society's standards.

His days started early and ended late, filled with an exhausting list of chores. Yet, he never complained about his long hours or his thankless job. Instead, he wore a smile, one that reflected gratitude and happiness. For he believed that being happy with what he had was far more important than dwelling on what he did not.

Garry may have been underpaid, but he was rich in gratitude, contentment, and peace of mind. He found joy in his work, cherishing the purpose it gave him, and the structure it lent to his life. The corporate office building was not just a place of work to him, but it was a place that brought meaning and direction to his life.

Yes, Garry knew he was underpaid, but he chose not to focus on it. Instead, he focused on his job, the job he was more than happy to have. He focused on being grateful for the chance to work, to earn a living, and to enjoy the little things in life that his job provided him. And that made all the difference.","173,40,89,86,206,129,301,82,233,221,97,74,67,311,122,69,314,320,41,151,208,65,135,156,253,291,299,165,283,258,326,141,230,158,159,167,127,168,118,4,68,210,32,47,161,29,20,300,238,260,28,119,90,213,239,142,120,85,207,75,93,106,237,140,98,216,248,329,172,117,261,327,62,153,48,228,268,126,31,285,0,339,107,105,36,79,150,115,289,51,166,19,25,163,255,262,139,196,84,134,321,1,10,46,214,256,201,219,176,39,202,44,77,223,175,143,332,52,35,27,309,53,136,174,274,297,279,157,249,286,17,317,66,312,278,60,292,215,155,121,194,204,218,313,171,334,205,276,103,180,316,179,284,14,185,154,148,200,108,149,220,272,34,94,160,18,287,137,335,246,54,336,259,338,244,116,265,189,15,197,251,193,71,178,298,12,43,111,242,56,170,305,95,50,11,55,293,290,236,319","106,30,173,50,71","1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 27, 28, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
258,"Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.","Sally is an intelligent, independent woman with a keen understanding of her life and the people around her. No one could ever accuse her of being in the dark about the nature of her circumstances. Her relationship with Scott, however, is a complex tapestry of emotions that outsiders may not fully understand. It is not that Sally is clueless about her situation with Scott. In fact, she is fully aware of it, with all its nuances and subtleties.

Scott, a handsome, charismatic man, was known for his charm and captivating personality. However, beneath that charming veneer, he was complicated and troublesome. He had a history of short-lived relationships and questionable decisions. His reputation had always been a significant concern to Sally, making their relationship a subject of constant speculation amongst their friends.

But Sally saw a different side of Scott, a side that was not common knowledge. There was an undeniable softness and vulnerability that he displayed in the comfort of their solitude. It was this side of him that Sally fell in love with, a side that made her dismiss all the judgments from the outside world.

Scott had his flaws, and Sally was not oblivious to them. She had noticed his occasional reckless behavior, his inability to commit, and his nonchalant attitude towards her feelings at times. She was not blind to his shortcomings, and it had led to countless nights of introspection, weighing the pros and cons of their relationship.

Her friends often questioned her decision to stay with Scott. They wondered if she was indeed aware of his past, of his reputation. Sally was not ignorant, and she had decided to stay with him, knowing everything. Their concerns only highlighted her understanding of her situation, making her even more determined to remain by Scott's side.

Sally recognized that her relationship with Scott was not perfect. It was filled with doubts, concerns, and confusion, but it also consisted of love, laughter, and unforgettable memories. Sally had decided to be with him despite the circumstances. She valued his love, his presence in her life, and his influence on her.

Yes, Scott was not perfect, and neither was their relationship, but Sally wasn't looking for perfection. She was looking for someone who made her happy, who understood her, and who made her feel loved, and in Scott, she found all these things. And so, despite his flaws, despite the circumstances, Sally chose to stay with Scott. She chose love over everything else because, for her, loving Scott was worth it all.","174,63,324,317,93,99,182,261,227,8,270,216,128,49,172,141,118,330,37,264,106,46,0,58,42,136,103,271,184,100,55,319,131,89,181,198,150,220,299,168,167,3,91,50,145,191,4,312,336,281,47,176,179,285,6,199,32,80,234,307,255,142,95,196,204,140,27,81,130,40,9,225,65,310,62,339,269,78,20,327,316,115,246,53,250,34,188,322,101,138,195,61,239,252,242,197,228,149,211,260,259,335,235,123,262,161,207,15,212,31,334,201,321,241,28,71,318,1,114,306,112,294,16,193,43,256,291,155,219,279,163,52,57,272,87,159,178,332,338,249,160,267,169,107,119,73,175,192,18,282,257,102,85,60,76,66,127,82,223,303,109,230,320,96,132,13,268,146,226,254,116,41,329,153,19,210,105,25,152,304,251,129,90,144,244,305,14,276,290,84,97,171,236,221,21,17,137,186,12,213","126,151,101,100,8","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
259,"He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.","Jason had known Rick since they were in high school. Back then, Rick had a reputation for being the life of the party, always surrounded by friends and never short on popularity. Jason, being an introverted scholar, was drawn to this vibrant energy. In Rick, he saw a chance to experience a different kind of life, an adventurous one. However, over time, as they grew older and entered into the real world, Jason began noticing a pattern in Rick's actions.

Rick was always at his peak when he needed something. More often than not, that 'something' was money. Whenever Jason experienced good fortune, like a promotion at work or an unexpected financial gain, Rick would be right there, hand outstretched and a bright smile on his face. His friendship seemed to be tied directly to Jason's pocket.

Jason had a soft spot for him though. After all, they had been friends for a long time. He'd seen Rick at his lowest and had helped him back up. Their bond had persisted despite Rick’s selfish behavior.

Jason was aware of Rick's true nature. He was no fool. He knew that his so-called friend was only after his money. Yet, he chose to get along with him, at least for the time being.

The situation was not ideal, but Jason had his reasons. For one, he pitied Rick. He had seen him struggle with multiple dead-end jobs, unable to hold any of them for long. He also knew about Rick's unfortunate family circumstances, about the burden of debt that had fallen on him at a young age.

Furthermore, Jason was lonely. His work left him with very little time to socialize and make new friends. And despite his shortcomings, Rick was a familiar presence, someone who had been around since he was a teenager.

Jason considered confronting Rick, talking to him openly about his exploitative behavior, but he never found the courage to do so. He felt the risk of losing this friendship - however parasitic it may be - was too high. 

Therefore, he decided to keep his thoughts to himself. He would continue to tolerate Rick's behavior for as long as he could bear it, silently hoping that one day Rick would realize his mistakes and make amends. But until that day arrived, he chose to navigate the turbulent waters of this flawed friendship, knowing that only money kept their bond afloat.","263,12,40,311,279,241,177,319,251,53,82,34,72,125,165,76,167,25,142,208,14,145,222,224,4,282,192,295,325,219,236,332,135,9,297,189,305,21,262,132,41,147,207,29,183,49,260,334,116,62,261,172,162,78,227,16,109,258,296,5,84,74,106,221,56,60,328,291,96,80,114,232,85,276,33,151,140,131,126,88,254,338,339,139,98,231,201,105,300,301,161,102,39,202,71,244,323,81,264,274,121,122,44,314,220,50,203,143,302,75,168,1,47,312,329,252,256,133,214,137,95,230,179,104,136,0,22,54,149,209,123,242,129,257,292,315,2,90,278,70,197,79,15,250,277,195,186,304,336,249,240,144,237,157,324,333,284,316,233,89,198,51,331,55,138,286,190,17,243,308,265,204,23,170,128,307,181,248,158,117,64,321,245,330,273,215,3,146,48,281,113,196,103,38,313,86,266,65,156,247","117,134,58,47,51","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
260,"The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.","Dr. Bentley, a respected physics professor at the prestigious Carlton University, was always known for his fair and meticulous grading policy. His expertise was unparalleled in the field, yet he held a reputation as being sympathetic towards his students. One morning, as he sat in his office sipping his usual cup of black coffee, he noticed something peculiar about the homework assignments he was grading.

They seemed uncannily similar to one another. Even the slightest errors, deviations in logical analysis, and misguided conclusions were replicated consistently across a majority of the assignments. The answers were there, but they lacked the unique process of thinking, the individual reasoning that Dr. Bentley encouraged in his students.

He quickly identified that the students must have mostly copied the homework from each other. But, as he gazed out at the vibrant maple tree outside his office window, he found himself contemplating his reaction. He was usually strict about such matters, but for some reason, he felt a whisper of understanding.

Dr. Bentley looked at the calendar. It was the middle of the term, right between two major exams and students were definitely under significant pressure. He remembered his own struggles as a student and thought about how the stress of balancing studies, extracurricular activities, and personal issues was often overwhelming.

He realized his course might just add another layer of stress for the students. The real purpose of education was to nurture critical thinkers, not to stress them with an overabundance of work. He found himself questioning his own teaching methodology and curriculum.

Dr. Bentley recalled a conversation with his mentor, who once said that teaching, like all sciences, requires the ability to adapt. He concluded it was time for him to adapt his approach to better serve his students and cater to their realities.

Having reached this understanding, he decided to not be strict about the apparent copying. Instead, he marked the assignments, leaving detailed notes about how they could improve their reasoning. He then dedicated the next lecture to discuss the importance of integrity, originality, and academic honesty in an educational setting, tying it up with a brief story about his own struggles as a student.

He also decided to reassess his teaching methods, making changes where necessary. He shifted his focus from quantity to quality of assignments, understanding the pressures of a demanding college environment. This was not an act of leniency but rather a transformation in his teaching philosophy.

The next day, Dr. Bentley addressed his class with a humble voice, outlining the changes. The students listened attentively, relieved, some even with gratitude shining in their eyes. He understood that this was a moment of true education. A lesson that transcended the four walls of a classroom and reached into the hearts of his students.

That day, the professor learned a valuable lesson himself - that being strict was not always synonymous with good education. It was more about understanding, compassion, and guiding the students on the right path.","8,109,286,339,178,233,312,37,47,136,223,261,22,64,290,171,217,225,228,186,105,165,184,166,177,97,40,130,39,326,243,256,221,74,29,115,78,85,160,230,12,182,59,147,163,236,6,335,14,294,192,258,319,275,83,194,235,282,138,129,84,211,204,218,89,150,140,170,169,244,185,310,181,143,65,325,167,108,124,38,304,137,203,51,198,195,193,330,238,234,122,146,327,187,162,309,183,21,328,188,227,9,253,263,53,111,274,240,90,305,0,161,31,48,248,120,149,88,336,70,114,329,121,142,301,106,268,302,113,119,56,141,107,117,237,296,299,116,257,54,131,273,314,15,322,75,60,19,231,232,199,96,55,104,272,285,94,249,190,306,25,151,324,210,45,175,331,271,281,292,27,259,93,110,7,92,159,318,321,66,26,28,317,334,191,316,265,118,68,102,71,123,280,254,262,100,174,5,212,291","32,139,52,172,12","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
261,"Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.","Lisa was always particular about her belongings, especially her extensive collection of books that she had meticulously built over the years. Her books were her prized possessions, collected from various bookstores, flea markets, and annual book fairs. They were more than mere ink and paper; they were her escape from reality, her means to visit strange worlds and experience countless adventures. Naturally, she was protective of them, never lending them out, even to her closest friends.

Among her friends was Mark, an avid reader himself. Their shared love for literature was what had initially brought them together, strengthening their friendship over time. Mark had always admired Lisa's collection and often expressed his desire to borrow a few. However, mindful of her possessive attitude towards her books, he refrained from asking.

One day, while Mark was at Lisa's apartment, he spotted 'To Kill a Mockingbird', a classic he'd been wanting to read for quite some time. Seeing Lisa engrossed in her work, Mark made a quick, impulsive decision. He borrowed the book without asking, thinking he would return it before she noticed. But he underestimated Lisa's deep connection with her books.

The following day, while she was cleaning her bookshelf, Lisa noticed that the Harper Lee classic was missing. She immediately knew who had taken it. She knew Mark had long wanted to read the book but wasn't sure if he would cross the line. Lisa felt a twinge of annoyance, but she decided to let it pass.

She chose not to confront him about the book the next time they met. She didn't want to risk their friendship over a book, despite its importance. Lisa simply carried on with their usual conversations, discussing everything from new book releases to their favorite authors.

Days turned into weeks, and Mark finally finished reading 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. He felt a sense of accomplishment as he closed the book. However, the guilty feeling of taking it without permission lingered. Little did he know, Lisa was already aware of his actions.

One evening, Mark decided to return the book. Seeing Lisa's surprised face as he handed it back made him realize she had known all along. Mark apologized profusely for his actions, admitting that he should have asked first.

Lisa accepted the apology and told him she was just happy to have her book back. From that moment on, she knew her trust in Mark had only strengthened. They never spoke of the incident again, but the understanding they shared made their friendship even more profound.

Even though Lisa could have made a big deal about Mark borrowing her book without asking, she chose not to. And it was this compassionate decision, this silent understanding, that helped their friendship grow stronger.","225,61,56,142,264,278,292,104,228,62,257,251,15,333,256,244,124,116,138,236,172,23,209,284,327,326,94,291,9,33,199,205,281,231,39,37,55,189,103,302,186,122,137,218,273,253,235,88,145,4,144,32,283,18,49,313,126,213,295,175,110,146,50,210,255,99,214,96,45,28,114,184,309,263,10,80,202,12,293,111,265,83,211,81,246,115,6,239,250,158,330,106,90,14,237,241,240,227,36,222,1,57,151,13,26,119,34,238,171,203,303,128,154,216,260,75,89,112,289,102,165,134,279,46,269,193,301,93,84,92,98,16,268,167,259,166,198,149,212,139,73,220,100,319,243,77,42,232,162,153,69,315,271,277,76,208,58,157,195,67,164,322,234,308,143,156,185,161,310,197,22,176,54,187,282,288,25,334,170,163,280,169,316,221,233,40,248,41,0,133,286,196,300,188,258,247,132,118,24,130","15,11,195,135,115","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
262,"She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","Susan was a quiet girl, growing up in a small town, nestled within the picturesque beauty of Massachusetts. Her parents owned a quaint bookstore, where she spent most of her time, immersing herself in the realm of words and knowledge. She was an introvert by nature, preferring the company of her books over social interactions.

At school, she was almost invisible, going about her routine diligently but without any boastful declarations. She never drew attention to herself and quietly pursued her passion for learning. What set Susan apart was her humbleness. Even though she was an exceptional student, she never bragged about her grades. It was a practice, she believed, that detracted from the true joy of learning.

The biggest event for every student in their academic life in Massachusetts was the State Board Exams. This marked the end of their secondary education and was the stepping stone towards their future. The pressure was immense, and the competition, even more so. Students proudly flaunted their preparations, bragging about their predicted scores in an attempt to assert their superiority over their peers.

Yet, Susan remained an exception to this otherwise common trend. She quietly continued her studies, leaving others to speculate about her capabilities. She never boasted about her academic prowess or the scores she would obtain in the board exams. Instead, she chose to let her actions reflect her talent and dedication.

The day of the results arrived with palpable tension in the air. As the school bell rang, students huddled nervously, discussing their expectations and fears. The principal came on the stage, ready to announce the toppers of the board exams. There was a hushed silence as the students listened with bated breath.

Susan stood quietly at the back of the crowd, her heart pounding in her chest. With a clear voice, the principal announced, ""In the second position, we have Susan Miller."" A gasp went around, followed by enthusiastic applause. Many students turned to look at her, some in surprise, others with admiration shining in their eyes.

Susan walked up to the stage amidst the applause, a slight smile on her face. She had secured the second position in the board exams, not by bragging about her potential but by proving it. She had let her actions speak louder than her words, and they echoed clearly in the silence that followed the announcement. This was Susan's triumph, and it was quiet, humble, yet resoundingly clear.

Just like Susan, this incident stood as a testament that truly, actions do speak louder than words. Her accomplishment was the perfect example of how humility and diligence can lead to great success, setting her apart from her bragging peers. 

From then onwards, Susan remained an inspiration, a beacon of quiet strength, proving that the humble and silent achievers could shine just as brightly, if not more.","168,290,224,127,126,261,153,90,286,326,79,87,210,46,1,99,226,255,29,232,133,27,204,121,328,284,81,102,312,164,294,62,265,214,322,7,6,321,246,302,196,118,111,93,253,122,143,22,9,167,142,288,108,13,218,166,336,50,162,234,24,17,319,20,124,15,61,243,132,161,228,251,135,80,82,276,267,315,289,240,140,157,55,327,28,318,280,148,95,106,230,116,222,136,207,159,70,40,60,199,242,213,110,105,97,101,301,152,329,84,311,187,21,306,51,231,324,208,85,49,260,139,44,36,115,66,205,338,235,73,32,264,69,323,130,263,335,305,332,245,33,125,177,3,186,98,313,298,144,238,314,183,76,43,316,241,63,35,197,247,31,175,287,53,203,257,38,310,223,320,182,266,109,30,23,337,281,10,94,221,283,269,86,317,145,249,212,202,181,8,59,180,41,244,331,54,304,158,4,67","136,132,33,172,77","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
263,"He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.","Martin was a man of few words, a man who often kept his emotions to himself. He was a gentleman in his own right, treating everyone with decency and respect. But there was one person who stood out among the others, a woman named Lucy. Lucy was his childhood friend, a radiant woman with a kind heart and a beautiful soul. He had known her for years, yet he had never told her about the complex feelings he harbored for her.

Every time he saw Lucy, his heart pounded with an intensity that made him wonder if it was visible to her. He yearned to express his feelings but was constantly held back by the fear of risking their friendship. However, his actions spoke louder than his silence. Every time they met, he was caring towards her, always ensuring she was comfortable and happy.

One day, Lucy fell ill. Martin was there, providing homemade soup and keeping her company. He patiently listened to her complaints about the illness, never once showing signs of impatience or irritation. His heart ached to see her in such a state, yet he masked his worries behind a comforting smile.

Over time, his feelings for Lucy grew stronger. He found himself always looking for ways to make her smile, to make her life easier. He would make an extra cup of coffee when he knew she was tired, he would pick up her favorite flowers just to brighten her day.

When they sat together, he would always ensure that she was warm enough, offering his jacket when the weather was chilly. When it rained, he would shield her with his umbrella, not caring if he got wet. His actions, although subtle, were filled with an emotion he was unable to utter - love.

Throughout their conversations, he was always mindful of her feelings, careful not to upset her or say anything that might offend her. His eyes would linger on hers, stealing glances when she wasn't looking. The silent longing in his gaze, however, was often misunderstood by Lucy as concern.

During social gatherings, he would stay by her side, ensuring she was never alone. He was her confidant, her protector, her silent admirer. Yet, he was just her friend in Lucy’s eyes. 

Martin's heart ached every time he heard her talk about other guys, yet he smiled and listened, keeping his feelings hidden away. He loved her in silence, a secret he kept well. Although he never told her about his feelings, his actions were always caring, always loving.

In the end, it was his enduring, silent love that defined him. It was not an unrequited love, but rather a love that he chose to keep hidden, for the sake of their friendship. Martin was indeed a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes about his love for Lucy.","77,291,339,32,273,318,194,97,226,89,82,294,102,118,274,139,163,168,271,229,15,103,220,14,326,90,100,101,64,154,87,204,138,297,310,307,71,75,6,95,282,195,259,175,225,293,203,266,27,287,171,10,210,91,164,265,243,209,137,66,162,143,5,331,315,199,31,78,240,2,190,176,50,46,18,51,120,38,262,182,81,147,169,281,23,284,313,157,125,119,192,249,267,174,84,96,106,170,275,20,37,33,205,60,148,227,85,11,146,230,149,124,298,56,160,335,127,130,239,30,304,80,48,22,45,277,301,29,107,185,115,47,12,322,252,57,214,206,268,237,26,0,134,40,44,111,144,55,136,108,93,53,261,65,264,217,17,152,61,128,222,213,311,123,338,314,238,269,178,290,159,140,35,316,186,296,13,224,4,109,177,250,201,295,260,183,41,70,161,145,306,165,332,228,328,245,208,112,167,303","79,155,56,48,93","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
264,She posted a lot about her friendship with Mary on Instagram. But in reality they hardly had any bond as they were constantly on their phones when together.,"Sara was a popular Instagram influencer, boasting several thousands of followers. To her followers, her life appeared perfect, full of adventures and fun-filled encounters. One such relationship that caught her followers' attention was her relationship with Mary, another social media star. Sara regularly posted about their friendship. Photos of their coffee dates, shopping sprees, and vacations filled her Instagram feed. To the outside world, it seemed like they shared an enviable bond.

However, the truth of the matter was quite different. Sara and Mary were more like digital friends than actual companions. In reality, they hardly had any bond. Their meetings were more of photo-ops than bonding time. Every smile, every selfie, every hashtag was carefully crafted for the 'gram.

Their Instagram stories gave off a veneer of the perfect friendship, but the reality was far less glamorous. When they were together, they were constantly on their phones, checking their social media accounts, snapping pictures and responding to fans. They hardly ever looked up from their screens to engage in meaningful conversation.

In coffee shops, they would sit across from each other, smartphones at the ready, talking more to their followers than to each other. Shopping trips were reduced to finding the perfect background for their photos. Their vacations were spent scouting locations, obsessing over their appearances, and clicking hundreds of pictures.

Their meals together were often cold by the time they had captured the perfect shot. And even then, they were preoccupied with the reactions and comments their posts would receive. The connection they were supposedly sharing was nothing more than a product for public consumption.

It was a strange sort of loneliness, being with someone yet feeling alone. Real emotions and experiences were pushed aside in their pursuit of the perfect online image. The fondness they professed for each other was hard to see behind their glowing screens.

But to their followers, none of this mattered. To them, Sara and Mary were best friends, their friendship an aspiration. The truth of their relationship was hidden behind filters and emojis, carefully curated captions and strategically scheduled posts.

Sara often found herself yearning for a genuine human connection, one that went beyond likes and comments. But in her world of influencer friendships and digital companionships, the reality was different. The lines between her social media persona and her actual personality were blurred, making it hard to distinguish between the two. Thus, she continued to post a lot about her friendship with Mary on Instagram, even though they hardly shared a real bond.","141,263,202,292,192,217,0,286,50,258,154,12,13,334,160,223,107,112,91,74,147,177,206,73,296,321,336,184,295,51,83,234,204,236,302,130,182,135,167,39,164,189,186,339,272,62,174,76,97,219,269,131,298,268,20,230,317,87,42,94,89,96,306,240,191,275,214,7,86,101,294,144,265,175,319,328,181,134,85,82,63,327,281,225,34,338,79,326,65,114,185,104,238,221,273,285,41,29,56,308,40,162,161,172,99,117,193,267,1,205,153,190,168,250,25,15,9,245,307,158,140,207,8,57,266,32,5,139,165,276,293,262,120,126,17,88,208,309,290,200,173,28,243,247,211,226,61,37,253,119,123,171,31,176,111,103,169,30,3,108,242,256,303,310,59,257,90,127,235,27,55,222,166,237,14,132,170,11,72,197,329,324,335,145,22,163,78,246,325,46,53,282,71,66,331,93,23,156,216,318","132,2,73,125,108","1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","Steve was always a humble man, often berating his guitar skills to anyone who would listen. He'd claim he was no good, wasn't particularly talented, and didn't deserve any accolades. He would constantly insist that he was out of practice, that his fingers weren't as nimble as they used to be. It was as if he was making himself smaller in the world of music, concealing his true abilities behind the veil of his self-deprecating comments.

Every Sunday, the local pub hosted open-mic nights. Many locals brought their talents, from singers to comedians. Steve always sat in the back, nursing his beer while watching others perform. He was a familiar face, yet nobody had ever heard him play.

One night, after one too many drinks, Steve got up and approached the stage. The crowd gave a surprised murmur as he gently cradled a worn-out guitar. He was nonchalant about it, even making a few jokes about messing up before he started. 

However, when he strummed the first chord, it was as if a spell had been cast over the pub. The laughter and chatter died down, replaced by the rich, resonating sounds of the guitar. A melody, both melancholy and beautiful, filled the air as he plucked the strings with an ease that contradicted his previous claims of incompetence.

Each note he played was proof of his dedication and passion. They revealed countless hours spent mastering complex tunes and chords. The harder his fingers pressed onto the frets, the louder the pub fell into an awestruck silence. Every strum spoke a language of its own, conveying emotions words could not capture.

His performance was like a journey, a musical exploration of his soul. The poignant notes danced around the room, leaving spectators utterly spellbound. The gritty timbre of his voice blended flawlessly with the harmony of the guitar, creating a symphony of sound that stirred emotions deep within the listeners. 

As he hit the last note, the silence lingered for a moment longer. Then, the pub exploded into applause. Steve just gave a shy smile, slightly taken aback by the overwhelming reaction. He gently set the guitar down, thanked the crowd, and retreated to his usual spot at the back.

From then on, people knew the truth. They understood that Steve's humility masked an artistic genius. His spoken words about his guitar skills were poor, yes, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced. His tunes carried the truth, painting a picture of dedication and immense talent, redefining the man behind the instrument.","318,264,212,167,116,158,112,4,180,191,71,54,283,235,150,78,286,273,74,142,339,119,170,84,195,218,70,250,172,257,178,249,219,37,239,222,313,206,137,133,253,26,231,128,96,312,53,81,109,177,317,216,266,333,316,59,111,267,227,169,45,102,123,274,44,162,295,155,5,234,259,147,7,171,122,263,232,146,203,332,23,124,100,118,62,223,300,293,306,85,213,164,58,108,0,320,34,126,188,98,311,290,103,125,33,190,314,86,151,255,43,153,245,331,17,97,56,131,297,66,247,39,11,60,302,92,163,276,135,141,51,187,193,95,301,214,120,288,132,330,179,80,149,18,139,89,47,165,77,327,82,329,294,226,269,303,315,144,209,30,198,79,262,197,73,325,69,1,251,244,75,319,270,115,29,229,207,160,194,136,90,230,252,64,27,240,9,256,254,83,175,292,140,184,324,243,105,221,68,114","163,76,2,53,58","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
266,Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.,"Garry had always been one to preach about his methods of managing stress. In every gathering with friends or colleagues, he was the one who would share inspiring stories and wise nuggets about handling work pressure effectively. He spoke of meditation, regular workouts, good diet, adequate sleep, and maintaining a positive outlook. He gave lengthy talks on how he expertly managed the intense workload and strict deadlines that were an inherent part of his job as a corporate lawyer.

He explained that stress was an inevitable part of life, but it could be controlled with the right mindset. Garry, always articulate and expressive, shared these experiences as if he was reading from an expert manual on stress management. He often told stories about how he effortlessly took care of his clients, handled multiple court cases and yet maintained a calm demeanor, never letting the stress affect him.

However, there was one detail that Garry didn't speak about - his constant need for cigarettes. He was rarely seen without a lit cigarette between his fingers, its smoke clouding around him. The contrast between his stories of stress management and his addictive behaviour was stark and impossible to ignore.

His fingers were always slightly yellowed from nicotine stains, and he often had the smell of smoke clinging to his clothes. He would light one, smoke it down to the filter, and then almost immediately light another. His home was a mess of ashtrays filled with stubs and empty cigarette packets littered around. 

His loved ones often confronted him about his damaging habit, and how it was a silent testimony to the toll his stressful job was taking on him. They said that his need for cigarettes didn't align with the picture of stress management he tried to paint. It told a story of a man who was drowning in stress and using cigarettes as a crutch to carry on.

Garry would often brush off their concerns, justifying his smoking as a mere habit rather than a coping mechanism. However, his constant need for that little stick of tobacco revealed a different story altogether. His verbose accounts of stress management were overshadowed by the silent, persuasive narrative of his cigarettes - a story of struggle, desperation, and an internal battle with work-induced stress.

His friends, family, and even his coworkers saw this truth, and although they loved Garry, they could not ignore the different story his incessant smoking was narrating. Garry, through his actions, showed that while he spoke of managing stress with ease, he was indeed fighting a quiet battle every day - a battle with his work stress and his ever-increasing dependence on cigarettes.","143,285,7,56,37,221,297,27,134,86,156,277,175,236,13,167,163,310,260,268,235,292,205,68,133,238,11,269,218,98,259,91,96,136,276,226,3,262,158,53,49,92,110,74,172,240,320,241,194,45,281,113,71,78,63,6,212,178,282,230,250,326,287,324,176,17,333,129,318,211,193,290,36,147,329,83,19,159,267,265,88,82,137,89,264,119,202,162,142,65,24,337,249,334,243,275,106,109,309,328,121,15,245,141,335,196,2,117,149,247,201,103,42,220,187,12,253,207,124,69,43,181,66,286,127,224,57,206,166,278,161,313,338,120,168,188,231,18,254,25,108,111,323,331,298,173,304,55,81,228,210,164,288,145,0,222,177,165,257,130,102,339,258,216,307,139,261,190,104,138,171,283,101,22,189,125,128,306,77,225,51,237,321,169,244,208,314,76,34,67,41,154,308,263,213,118,170,256,279,94","38,194,85,80,79","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"Peter was a shy, introverted child, always a little quicker to observe rather than participate. His parents, Ms. Helen and Mr. Jack, were simple folk, not particularly educated, but rich in wisdom and full of life. They often remarked, ""We are not good parents at all,"" with a humorous twinkle in their eye. Their humility belied the truth of their parenting, one characterized by patience, understanding, and unyielding love.

Peter had two siblings, Jenny and Tom. His parents dedicated equal attention to each child, always ready to spend quality time with them. They helped with homework after school, attended all sporting events, and crafted family rituals that were unique to the household. Their commitment to their children's well-being was evident in the warmth that filled their modest home.

Over time, this love manifested in many ways. They initiated weekly 'family nights' where they would play board games, watch films, or simply talk and share stories. They made sure each birthday was celebrated extravagantly, each achievement acknowledged, and every downfall tenderly comforted. Helen and Jack ensured their children understood the importance of a strong, loving relationship through their own interactions with each other.

Despite their self-deprecating humor about their supposed lack of parenting skills, Peter's parents' actions told a different story. They were always available, ready to listen, eager to understand, and prompt to provide guidance when needed. This love was not only expressed verbally, it was palpable in their actions and decisions.

The children grew up with a strong sense of security and belonging. They were confident, rooted, and well-adjusted, far from the often seen rebellious and frustrated young adults. They could argue it was natural progression, but the undeniable fact was their parents' ceaseless love and attention that played a vital role.

One day, Peter decided to express his gratitude. He gathered his siblings, and they collectively penned down a heartfelt letter, thanking their parents for their unwavering love and guidance. They expressed how they felt about their parents' humble attitude towards their parenting style. They wrote about how appreciative they were of their upbringing and how it had molded them into better individuals.

Finally, they left the letter on their parents' bed, anxiously waiting for their reaction. When Helen and Jack read it, tears welled up in their eyes. They hugged each other and their children, overwhelmed by the emotions flowing in the room.

Peter's parents may have often joked about being ""not good parents,"" but their actions showed they were indeed very good parents. Their self-deprecating humor was their humility talking, but the love, attention, and quality time they spent with their children spoke volumes about their parenting. Helen and Jack were not just good parents; they were extraordinary.","25,212,244,182,91,14,276,11,46,95,42,263,56,120,61,114,23,310,163,302,242,193,159,233,117,166,118,260,262,160,143,22,306,317,39,10,232,93,181,71,225,32,107,90,265,199,229,69,12,204,313,250,318,174,195,155,290,272,297,18,156,176,314,311,324,319,203,58,188,130,198,273,83,221,288,251,105,248,48,285,219,320,158,295,309,231,106,26,150,54,101,1,35,243,67,165,97,122,315,74,210,322,179,7,108,80,157,164,296,17,184,300,38,264,55,146,289,43,298,142,291,70,86,99,282,228,102,274,254,316,206,304,126,189,266,208,216,134,68,252,186,60,284,33,190,63,131,236,258,307,16,53,75,129,278,261,222,227,13,256,220,78,338,144,303,255,65,173,9,287,294,196,247,257,88,96,175,51,336,145,279,325,153,177,183,331,275,172,89,249,19,84,21,335,136,305,209,253,20,192","29,12,114,45,135","1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
268,A forest grew near the river.,"Once upon a time, in a tranquil part of the world, a lush, green forest grew near the river. The river, named Serenity, gently meandered through rolling hills, nurturing everything that existed alongside. It provided life to all living things around, creating an enchanting biosphere teeming with life.

The forest, on the other hand, was brimming with a plethora of trees, exotic fauna, and vivid flora. This spot was a verdant paradise, painting a picture of utmost tranquillity and peace. The trees reached high towards the heavens, swaying gently in rhythm with the winds, their leaves sparkling like green gems as sunlight filtered through them. This forest was a perfect harmony of nature, standing by the gentle course of the Serenity River.

Near the edge of this forest, where tall trees mingled with lush undergrowth and the river's lapping waters, were scattered traces of wildlife. Among them was a family of deer, with coats of tawny brown gleaming in the sun, always near the river's edge to quench their thirst. Birds of different sizes, shapes, and colors chirped happily, echoing through the forest and creating a melodious symphony. Even the trees seemed to hum in agreement, rustling their leaves in time to the orchestra of the wilderness.

Butterflies of all hues danced around the wildflowers that blossomed by the riverside, creating a spectacle of colors that was pleasing to the eye. Squirrels frolicked around merrily, their chitter-chatter adding to the ongoing music of the forest. Frogs croaked peacefully by the river, keeping a rhythm that seamlessly intertwined with the other forest sounds.

As the sun sank lower, the river sparkled in the fading sunlight, mirroring the vibrant hues of the evening sky. Fireflies began their nightly dance, punctuating the darkness with their soft glow. Owls hooted, their voices echoing in the stillness, while nocturnal creatures stirred from their day-long slumber.

As the moon rose high, the forest near the river transformed into a magical realm. The silver rays danced on the water, illuminating the forest in a soft, ethereal glow. The night's silence was soothing, broken only by the soft murmurs of the river and the whispering wind.

Each dawn welcomed a new day with a chorus of birdsong, while the sun lazily stretched its golden arms, bathing the forest in a warm glow. Life around the river flourished, reflecting the ever-changing yet consistent cycle of nature. Undeniably, the forest that grew near the river was more than just a collection of trees and wildlife; it was a magnificent spectacle of life and beauty, an enchanting symphony of the miracles of nature.","78,144,167,107,171,166,241,176,309,6,175,301,84,137,277,272,105,269,1,136,160,220,96,231,69,119,226,280,91,170,143,195,70,18,285,317,331,24,36,35,282,304,85,324,291,172,329,295,40,327,315,252,287,292,214,284,128,335,302,273,185,221,261,133,73,43,44,100,59,245,157,11,21,179,98,188,219,47,97,10,182,8,41,75,198,174,127,51,227,64,223,129,242,55,149,16,151,139,4,311,187,86,3,234,251,138,25,54,267,289,61,52,236,192,257,217,200,212,82,79,14,339,206,263,2,325,321,194,30,141,271,109,74,191,237,15,71,153,5,88,248,270,275,330,255,208,193,116,117,95,89,155,306,154,290,216,161,94,68,232,190,283,256,177,180,233,274,19,239,39,307,203,106,49,163,305,123,156,333,310,7,222,318,103,278,264,204,0,243,338,158,110,125,238,299,183,228,31,132,147","18,142,131,16,60","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"Deep in the heart of India, within the bustling city of Varanasi, lived an acclaimed guru. His name was Shastriji, renowned for his extensive knowledge and profound wisdom in ancient scriptures. Despite his humble abode, his reputation transcended the borders of the city, reaching the farthest corners of the country. Thus, many students from all walks of life came to study under him.

Driven by their yearning for knowledge, students from wealthy families, humble backgrounds, and even other gurus, filled Shastriji's humble courtyard. Some arrived with the intention of seeking spiritual enlightenment, while others hoped to deepen their understanding of philosophy and life. His disciples, young and old, came to learn the sacred truths that the guru had to offer.

The guru welcomed everyone warmly. His kind eyes and calm demeanor made even the most anxious novices comfortable. He encouraged his students to question and explore, underlining the importance of understanding rather than blind belief. The breadth and depth of his knowledge, ranging from science and mathematics to philosophy and spirituality, made learning under him an enriching experience.

An average day in Shastriji’s abode began with meditation, followed by a lively discussion on ancient scriptures and their relevance to contemporary times. Shastriji taught his disciples not just the art of understanding scriptures but also the ways to lead a righteous and content life. He inculcated in them a sense of respect for all living beings and the importance of self-discipline.

Shastriji's teaching methods were unconventional, but they were highly effective. He used the environment, daily activities, and even his students' experiences as teaching aids to provide practical examples. His teachings were riddled with anecdotes, parables, and wise sayings, making each lesson a remarkable journey of knowledge and wisdom.

Throughout the years, many students came and went, but the guru’s wisdom kept his courtyard always filled. His teachings shaped numerous scholars, thinkers, and leaders who propagated his wisdom across the world. These students ensured that Shastriji's teachings would continue to inspire and enlighten future generations.

Despite his passing away, his legacy remains prevalent today. His students, who once arrived at his humble abode with a thirst for knowledge, left as wise individuals ready to make a difference in the world. As each student scattered across different directions, carrying the teachings of the guru, the echoes of his wisdom were heard throughout the world. Shastriji's teachings continue to enlighten and guide many to this day, a testimony to the many students who came to study under the guru.

Soon, all the guests began gathering around.","It was a typically cold winter night and John had invited his closest friends over for a home-cooked meal. Each guest had arrived, bundled in scarves and jackets, their smiles filled with anticipation for the feast awaiting them. The house was filled with the enticing aroma of the sumptuous spread John was preparing in the kitchen.

John, dressed in a perfectly starched apron, kept moving back and forth between the dining room and kitchen, his hands holding one dish after another. From hearty stews to delicate appetizers, the food was an exciting array of culinary delights. The dining room table was soon laden with tantalizing dishes, their enticing aroma wafting through the entire house.

As John brought out each dish, he explained its origin, ingredients, and the inspiration behind its creation. His passion for cooking was evident in his words, making the whole experience even more engaging. John took immense pleasure in bringing smiles to people's faces through his food, and that night was no different. 

The guests, initially settled in the lounge, began hearing the clinking of cutlery and the fascinating tales of John's food, which piqued their interest. The once relaxed chatter amongst them shifted into intrigued murmurs. The beckoning aroma eventually proved too irresistible, and one by one, each guest started gathering around the dining room table.

There was Elizabeth, John’s childhood friend, a renowned food critic who could tell the exact ingredient just by the smell. Right next to her was Mike, John's long-time friend from college, always ready to devour any food placed in front of him. In the mix were also Sarah, John's neighbor, known for her fussy palate, and Peter, the foodie who traveled the world to taste different cuisines.

They gathered around the dining table, their eyes gleaming with anticipation and stomachs growling in hunger. Each face reflected a mix of curiosity and excitement as they admired the culinary feast in front of them. The room filled with appreciative exclamations and compliments for John's efforts.

John smiled at the gathering around his table. It was the very sight he had anticipated when planning this dinner. Seeing the faces light up at his creations gave him a sense of fulfillment that nothing else did. John loved cooking, but more importantly, he loved sharing his food, and nights like these were a testament to his passion.

271,Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.,"Mary's love for literature began at a young age when her parents used to read her bedtime stories. The way the words painted vivid pictures and transported her to different realms and time periods was a kind of magic to her. From fairy tales to adventures, each book opened up a new world to explore. Thus, she developed a penchant for collecting books.

By the time she was in her teens, Mary had an impressive collection of novels, biographies, poetry, and non-fiction. Her parents, noting her passion, gifted her a large bookshelf where she could display her growing library. The smell of old books, mixed with the scent of new ones, filled her room, hinting at the vast array of narratives she cherished.

Upon entering university, Mary's love for books didn't wane, but instead, flourished. She pursued literature as a major, gaining more insight into the power of the written word. Her collection expanded further with academic texts and works by lesser-known authors she discovered through her studies.

As years passed, her friends would joke about her intense obsession, saying that she could open her library. But Mary always laughed it off. At least until she relocated to a cozy farmhouse. The property had a large barn, which initially seemed unnecessary but soon sparked an idea in Mary's mind. 

She decided to convert this rustic barn into a makeshift library. It would not only hold her extensive collection but also become a haven for other bookworms in the area. 

With her plan in mind, Mary started organizing her books categorically. From Fiction to Philosophy, Children's Literature to Biographies, each genre found a dedicated corner in her library. She lovingly dusted off each book, remembering the story each one held before placing it on the shelves.

As the word spread in the local community about Mary's library, it sparked curiosity and interest. Soon, book clubs started meeting there, children came for storytelling sessions, and individuals began visiting to enjoy the peaceful sanctuary filled with books. 

Mary was elated. Her collection, once a personal pleasure, was now bringing joy to others. It was inspiring discussions, encouraging reading, and creating a sense of community. It had indeed become a library, a center for literature lovers. 

Through the years, Mary had collected books, treasuring each one for the stories they told. Little did she know, the books would one day be the foundation of her own library. A library not just made of wood and books but also brimming with love, passion, and the magic of storytelling.","166,33,139,284,10,252,203,128,305,207,103,246,81,204,53,101,173,285,310,191,300,256,70,65,296,294,131,176,56,205,332,276,124,268,156,134,24,106,248,97,34,298,201,151,219,93,265,7,208,67,244,283,167,264,177,242,292,228,195,232,288,44,237,150,0,40,22,31,280,162,129,49,214,123,266,6,272,301,206,146,217,157,26,179,15,339,328,2,64,133,141,122,313,99,182,35,36,13,91,69,126,98,269,184,338,319,304,52,330,59,312,212,230,231,145,46,117,198,50,112,76,257,79,277,116,21,175,290,136,66,333,63,235,86,94,5,221,23,186,125,251,261,142,311,315,169,273,30,263,299,138,258,180,255,316,216,172,89,8,100,42,249,110,320,289,160,28,120,119,303,144,9,243,197,38,306,83,278,270,165,279,225,84,132,18,113,200,234,85,158,155,233,92,17,254,275,159,87,336,96","34,103,179,77,147","1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
272,Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.,"After a night of tossing and turning, Andy finally admitted defeat to his sleeplessness. He glanced at the old worn-out alarm clock at his bedside; it was 5:30 am. He decided to rise from his bed, wrapped in blankets that could no longer offer the comfort he sought. His bedroom was imbued in darkness, with only the dim light from his alarm clock illuminating his path.

Gently, Andy pushed back the comforter, his tired body protesting the early morning rise. His worn-out slippers awaited him by his bedside, a promise of warmth and solace from the biting cold floor. Quietly, as if not to disturb the sleeping world, he walked across the room, his eyes still heavy with the burden of sleep.

Finally, he reached the window, the blinds shutting out any sign of the world outside. Andy's hand trembled slightly, a combination of the morning cold and anticipation, as he reached for the blinds' cord. He pulled the cord, and slowly, one by one, the blinds started lifting, gradually revealing the world outside.

As the blinds rose, he could see the sun rising in the distance, still in its early stages. The world outside was painted in hues of red and orange, the tell-tale signs of dawn. The sun was still mostly hidden, its rays just beginning to peak above the horizon, a shy child afraid to face the world.

The sight was breathtaking, a simple beauty that left Andy standing in awe. The evergreen trees stood silent, their leaves glistening with morning dew. The roads were empty, devoid of the usual hustle and bustle, and the air held a silent promise of the day to come.

He was mesmerized by the spectacle, his sleeplessness forgotten. He watched as the sun climbed higher, becoming bolder, its rays now reaching his window. A soft glow started to fill his room, pushing away the darkness that had kept him company for hours.

As the day broke, Andy's room became brightly lit, the light breathing life into the gloom that had previously consumed the space. He watched as his bedroom became a haven of warmth and light, a sharp contrast to the cold, desolate space it had been just a few hours prior.

Andy turned away from the window, his heart filled with a newfound appreciation for the morning. The sunrise had set the mood for his day, a reminder that even after the darkest nights, the sun always rose. His weariness had faded, replaced by the warmth of the rising sun. As he glanced one last time at his now brightly lit room, he found himself filled with a surge of gratitude, grateful for another day, another sunrise.","100,214,35,169,138,91,166,49,93,229,276,26,216,318,71,270,314,95,233,273,275,9,82,133,269,12,7,167,338,337,268,14,126,219,236,298,156,31,98,61,109,286,267,285,147,239,220,221,152,77,292,115,295,255,218,11,150,8,188,13,284,105,323,44,232,30,15,335,51,174,195,237,139,0,262,265,322,313,317,315,187,190,274,261,62,289,326,180,253,83,60,27,122,217,300,103,157,179,213,125,88,245,153,135,57,137,78,116,129,302,294,84,271,123,209,259,329,206,131,283,301,278,114,36,242,19,252,240,69,281,64,224,238,250,181,50,79,165,151,211,324,25,260,306,42,47,280,154,74,299,316,258,203,118,24,201,197,43,207,173,73,277,309,320,307,110,196,132,199,178,107,182,32,40,296,97,223,59,225,72,101,99,146,10,319,37,66,143,124,266,189,29,81,68,111,112,215,148,136,56","31,25,16,113,20","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"Once a rural landscape dominated by fields and farms, a sprawling suburban community has gradually taken form outside the city center over the past few decades. The transformation was subtle at first, the wide stretches of green farmland being gradually replaced by the developing town structures, until it grew into a grand spectacle of suburban life.

The change started approximately thirty years ago. One day, a real estate company with a vision bought large plots of farmland, promising the owners a better life. The owners agreed, mostly driven by the promise of financial stability. This marked the beginning of the suburban community.

The construction started slowly; architects came with blueprints and maps, analyzing the land. The rich soil that once held roots of crops was now being broken up to lay the foundation of homes. As the months passed, new structures began to rise - first, small homes with white picket fences, then larger ones with well-manicured lawns.

Over time, modern facilities such as shopping centers, schools, hospitals, and recreational parks started to appear. The infrastructure was well planned, with wide roads and tree-lined sidewalks. The newly built houses were quickly filled with young families seeking a quiet retreat from the bustling city life.

By the time the first decade passed, the former farmland had turned into a fully functioning suburban community, already home to a few thousand people. The community was self-sufficient, with grocery stores, schools, and workplaces within a short distance from the residential areas.

While residents traveled to the city center for work, many preferred to stay within the comfort of their newfound community. This was especially true for the retirees, who found the peaceful, slow-paced life in the suburbs more appealing than the city's rushed lifestyle.

As the years went by, the community expanded even more. New sections were added, offering different styles of homes to cater to the growing population. The schools grew in size and number, as did the commercial areas. The town even built its own movie theater and outdoor concert venue, attracting people from neighboring communities.

The community also invested in public services. A large library was built, boasting thousands of books and a quiet study area. Parks were dotted with play areas for children and open fields for sports events. The local government ensured that all citizens had access to public transportation to and from the city center.

Today, the large suburban community is a model for successful urban development. What started as a rural area has now become a bustling suburban town, providing its residents with a unique blend of city amenities and country tranquility.

Thus, over the past few decades, a vast suburban community has evolved outside the city center. It stands as a testament to the evolution of modern society, the shift from rural to urban, and the constantly changing human lifestyle.","337,35,158,63,125,291,244,99,5,12,230,84,146,275,324,191,271,325,75,307,31,52,228,24,81,283,120,210,166,70,233,148,327,43,65,7,249,115,270,119,141,3,108,309,252,224,135,204,296,21,153,335,207,257,58,39,114,22,183,247,88,211,124,318,294,286,203,105,69,60,67,85,94,319,314,267,284,157,76,227,48,18,26,27,321,132,32,121,236,55,38,329,169,281,312,200,300,323,42,0,322,302,44,13,46,101,182,320,306,216,155,266,130,126,159,292,268,278,238,15,231,237,176,144,25,336,117,232,277,138,122,330,201,54,150,259,116,334,192,118,311,187,41,188,57,10,297,173,143,202,23,190,333,19,9,92,205,6,179,310,290,198,209,221,136,217,87,14,285,197,177,104,16,253,279,171,145,91,280,33,326,239,256,152,79,269,4,331,72,251,49,113,11,164,272,289,106,274,40,248","117,186,39,17,195","1, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
274,Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.,"As we stumbled out of our dilapidated vehicle, the midday heat struck us like a whip, leaving a sting on our sunburned faces. We could almost see the waves of hot air twisting in the grim, barren landscape around us. Our legs trembled as we descended onto the strange terrain, contrasting sharply with the comfortable leather seats we were used to. And, under the merciless sun, the ground we had taken for granted looked hostile.

Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet. The lawn was not a soft carpet, inviting us to a walk, but a battle array of a silent army with sharp swords. It seemed as if they stood tall and resolute, driven by an unseen willpower, a collective force that breathed life into them. Ready to strike at our vulnerable skin, they sent ripples of shivers up our spine.

We took a cautious step forward, bracing for the impact. Our body winced as the tiny green bayonets stabbed at the soft pads of our feet. We gasped, looking down to find a patchwork of tiny red dots appearing where the grass blades met our flesh. 

“This is going to be a tough journey,” muttered my companion, his face stricken with exhaustion. His voice barely carried over the chorus of the late afternoon cicadas. I glanced over at him, noting the beads of sweat trickling down his temples, the slight tremble in his stance. He was a strong man, but even strong men faltered in the face of nature's unpredictable savagery. 

Resiliently, we trudged on, the pain growing with every step. But we were determined. Our mission was far from over and the hostile grass was merely a prickly reminder of the trials we had to face. 

The sun began to set, painting the sky with a palette of reds, oranges and purples, providing us little relief from the blaring heat. We sought shelter under a large outcrop of rocks, its shadow providing a cool solace from the still blazing sun.

As we sat there, bare feet throbbing, a grim sense of determination took over. We would survive this. We had to. For the journey, for our mission, for ourselves.

The night fell, casting a cool, quiet blanket over the menacing grass. It silenced the day's onslaught and left room for the gentle hush of the night wind. We lay on the hard, rocky ground, a temporary victory claimed over the grassy bayonets. As we stared at the endless blanket of stars, the cruel blades were forgotten. All that remained was the soft lullaby of the wind, carrying us away into the realm of dreams. 

Tomorrow was another day, promising new challenges. But for the moment, we savored the peace, healing in the calm before the storm. Our journey was not over, and we understood that the grass, with its tiny bayonets, was a mere prelude to the more daunting tasks that lay ahead. Each day was a step forward, each blade of grass a challenge to conquer. And conquer we must, for we were resilient.","108,30,285,173,112,259,297,46,69,148,62,209,21,27,318,247,298,214,263,270,48,284,268,253,76,295,184,1,234,2,317,327,223,181,265,117,0,260,322,332,326,4,116,96,254,217,330,114,221,287,61,109,159,19,74,309,115,185,219,334,120,83,283,276,304,246,213,54,337,190,70,264,273,240,140,93,29,323,237,169,126,24,288,197,280,299,211,56,210,176,201,172,279,10,208,312,233,72,311,3,269,324,79,266,192,216,51,80,336,135,331,179,134,40,248,313,81,49,75,60,228,38,286,162,25,31,175,236,160,44,333,277,77,71,58,163,235,141,9,183,150,174,191,188,82,249,203,155,151,23,189,178,12,17,99,161,275,193,224,26,16,239,57,97,232,255,90,218,339,130,67,229,171,103,153,296,121,261,65,290,123,199,225,257,110,256,53,154,267,278,282,22,168,131,144,20,136,50,281,138","157,64,132,190,93,85,199,191,63","1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"David was only seventeen when he first picked up a cigarette. His older brother, Jack, a habitual smoker, was the one who introduced him to the destructive habit. David was a bright, young, energetic boy who was full of life, but that single act changed everything.

His first puff seemed harmless at the time. It was at a party and everyone was doing it. He coughed and sputtered, but, eager to fit in, he persevered. The sensation was dizzying, a heady mix of rebellion and belonging. The notion that every cigarette smoked was a threat to his health didn't cross his mind then.

As the years passed, David became increasingly dependent on smoking. He couldn't start his day without lighting one up. His health started to decline. A persistent cough troubled him, and his breath was short and raspy. His once bright eyes, now began to reflect a perpetual tiredness. 

His family was concerned, of course. David was once energetic and full of vitality, always first in line for a game of soccer or a bike ride. But now, he seemed disinterested, lethargic. Their repeated warnings and pleas fell on deaf ears.

The more they urged him to quit, the more defiant he became. He was young, he argued, and his health was robust. The threat of a distant disease did not scare him. Despite the visible decline in his health, David continued to inhale the toxic fumes, ignorant to the long-term damage he was causing to his lungs.

His brother Jack was filled with guilt. It was he who introduced David to the dreadful habit. He made it a point to quit and set a better example, but by then, the damage was done.

One winter morning, David woke up gasping for air. His chest was tight and every breath was a struggle. Panicked, he was rushed to the hospital. The doctors ran several tests and the results confirmed their fears. David had developed a severe lung disease caused by his smoking habit.

It was a wake-up call. Every single cigarette he had ever smoked was indeed a threat to his health, just as everyone had warned him. The realization was too late; irreversible damage was already done.

From then on, David dedicated his life to raising awareness about the dangers of smoking. He shared his story with everyone he met, hoping to deter at least one person from picking up that first cigarette. He wanted to spread the message that each puff is a threat, each inhale a step closer to irreversible damage. He wished, too late, that he had understood this message earlier.","158,166,54,99,50,182,83,285,310,331,140,67,46,219,110,142,213,30,3,325,86,277,193,326,284,211,108,5,71,45,220,53,191,257,276,6,121,61,156,33,174,115,24,242,234,215,282,248,178,56,239,286,232,274,210,332,181,333,35,260,226,93,195,80,94,309,81,278,290,218,280,261,62,37,214,194,336,76,225,154,75,252,217,203,1,287,141,172,89,313,14,149,34,240,126,330,272,106,59,48,224,292,250,198,199,90,25,321,28,130,15,77,84,316,247,167,18,123,293,297,17,271,197,267,253,184,223,0,74,202,36,329,273,299,268,296,147,78,112,180,43,165,73,338,68,20,328,235,120,303,47,119,279,183,21,231,281,153,66,315,206,79,192,91,236,2,168,131,163,251,139,173,114,95,262,138,135,98,162,113,209,9,169,189,159,283,304,318,7,314,16,228,101,129,64,103,188,186,40,245","54,35,22,68,153,71,157,47,186","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"There was an ongoing argument between Mr. Rogers, an austere philosophy professor, and his prodigious student, Stephen. Stephen had boldly proposed a somewhat controversial theory during class. This theory clashed with Mr. Rogers' conventional views and he considered it a challenge.

Post class, they agreed to continue their discourse in the professor's office. Stephen eagerly took his seat, ready to defend his theory tooth and nail. He presented his argument, articulately outlining his views in a passionate monologue.

""Very well, Stephen,"" began Mr. Rogers, as he leaned back in his chair, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Then he proceeded with the unexpected - he attacked every point in Stephen's argument. It was surprising, to say the least, but Stephen remained unfazed, an indomitable spirit flickering in his eyes.

Mr. Rogers attacked the foundation of Stephen's argument, targeting the principles Stephen had employed. He questioned the resources Stephen used to formulate his theory, scrutinizing their credibility. He indicated contradictions and cited eminent philosophers whose theories disputed Stephen's.

It felt like a high-intensity chess match. Mr. Rogers played every offensive piece, leaving no room for Stephen to manoeuvre. His queries were like a torrential downpour, each one drenching Stephen's confidence a little more.

He presented counter-arguments, forcing Stephen to stumble upon his own words. Mr. Rogers took pleasure in establishing the superiority of his traditional beliefs, vehemently disputing Stephen's novelty. He pointed out flaws in Stephen's logic, leaving no stone unturned in his attack.

However, Stephen didn't crumble under the immense pressure. He continued to engage in the intellectual battle, defending his argument with an unparalleled determination. Mr. Rogers managed to put a dent in some of his points but Stephen stood his ground, ready to fight till the end.

The discussion continued for hours, stretching into the evening, the initial sunlight fading into darkness outside. In this battleground, there were no tangible weapons, only words used like sharpened swords. The tension was palpable as Mr. Rogers doggedly attacked every point in Stephen's argument, leading to an unprecedented discourse.

But the intellectual conflict ended inconclusively that day. Although Stephen's argument was under constant attack, he managed to answer most of Mr. Rogers' probing questions satisfactorily. The clash of the intellectual titans left them both drained and even more determined to reinforce their beliefs. They agreed to continue the debate at a later date, their minds filled with thoughts and strategies for the impending verbal duel.

The office was left echoing with their intellectual fervor as they departed, giving no indication of backing down. Though Mr. Rogers attacked every point in Stephen's argument that day, he couldn’t beat Stephen’s unyielding spirit. Their debate became a memorable incident in the annals of their philosophical duels, promising more thought-provoking discussions in the future.","283,252,229,100,55,115,178,279,88,220,8,246,29,4,288,208,14,108,51,301,307,77,149,102,277,171,184,70,308,235,116,173,271,123,169,240,119,167,318,270,120,312,192,68,304,327,224,98,186,54,12,222,93,335,267,5,66,38,72,152,191,23,175,211,43,78,305,241,114,27,336,109,266,137,31,71,284,185,41,36,256,258,97,156,187,99,48,247,269,285,254,157,118,280,281,319,16,303,143,205,257,215,89,131,121,138,113,233,3,160,49,151,317,199,163,177,129,268,130,46,59,13,206,84,126,293,139,95,159,250,141,314,15,329,28,236,180,210,162,1,234,134,282,10,306,195,278,260,117,261,239,274,218,255,32,213,65,296,198,264,91,313,30,165,251,150,39,140,193,287,83,81,324,19,101,80,63,94,148,124,18,92,244,214,144,61,231,2,302,275,332,33,190,188,37,238,209,69,227,166","152,190,25,147,8,94,95,143,1","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"In the quaint town of Sunflower, people lived a simple life with their cornfields, horses, and their treasured old-world traditions. However, one feature stood out like a sore thumb in this idyllic countryside setting - a towering cellphone tower. Some folks deemed it an eyesore, but there was no denying its importance. It was the town's sole link to the outside world.

The day started off quite ordinarily, with the townsfolk going about their regular routines. However, as the day rolled on, ominous grey clouds began gathering in the skies above. The people glanced upwards, sensing a significant storm brewing. Weather forecasts had predicted turbulent weather conditions, but nothing seemed to prepare them for what was to come.

Without warning, strong gusts of wind swept across the town. They howled and roared, tearing through rooftops and whistling eerily around corners. People secured their properties as best they could and rushed indoors, away from the raging winds.

Amid the chaos, the cellphone tower stood tall and steady, appearing almost defiant against the elements. But as the winds intensified, the strain on the structure became apparent. The cables, a critical element in its stability, began to sway dramatically, straining against the overwhelming force of the wind.

Then, disaster struck. The strong winds finally took their toll and snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The sound was sharp and swift, echoing eerily throughout the now nearly silent town. The townsfolk, peering from their windows, watched in horror as the tower listed precariously. It teetered on the brink of collapse, threatening to crash down onto the buildings below.

Fear gripped the town as they awaited the imminent crash. But, miraculously, the tower remained standing, leaning alarmingly but not falling. The townsfolk breathed a collective sigh of relief, even as the storm raged on.

It wasn't until the following morning that they truly understood the impact of the damaged tower. Sunflower was cut off from the world, thrown back into an era before modern communication. As the reality sunk in, a sense of dread spread throughout the town. They were now isolated, with no way to contact the outside world for help or notify them of their situation.

As they faced this new reality, the people of Sunflower realized the importance of the once-despised cellphone tower. What was once an eyesore was now a lifeline, a symbol of connection lost. The strong winds had not only snapped the cables but also shattered the sense of security that the outside world was always just a call away.","175,143,247,200,322,7,86,181,111,211,202,182,281,155,32,160,23,294,140,264,105,271,87,168,72,248,169,100,262,308,128,237,334,35,176,316,214,106,258,164,293,58,17,186,26,187,330,118,67,263,69,228,24,268,221,303,279,78,204,312,206,193,116,95,151,291,54,283,49,37,185,120,115,320,130,274,28,238,178,63,68,329,265,209,275,269,129,300,192,338,273,64,255,189,216,324,10,31,276,99,231,266,57,165,220,66,336,170,299,110,235,278,157,138,166,298,142,313,270,153,85,197,137,112,146,208,335,14,272,30,280,145,241,229,297,217,302,306,190,223,339,199,4,113,45,286,309,83,51,19,284,44,126,61,89,252,282,29,147,109,56,194,233,3,88,174,317,52,47,287,27,36,305,34,234,46,311,62,119,307,135,152,20,295,333,292,218,74,323,328,91,213,177,225,222,79,134,16,144,125","76,85,99,112,57,131,13,157,68","1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"Once upon a time, in a remote corner of the earth, lay an endless ocean. With the first light of dawn, a succession of waves began to batter a solitary, defiant rock that pierced the water's surface. The sound echoed through the silence of the morning, a rhythmic beating as if the ocean itself had a heartbeat. The rock, steep and formidable, stood there unyielding.

The waves, fierce and untamed, attacked relentlessly with a ferocity only nature could summon. Day after day, they came rushing towards the rock, each one bigger and stronger than the last. They roared against the rock, splashing it with white foam and salty water. The waves fought with gusto, believing with time and power they could wash the rock away. Yet, the rock remained solid, steadfast, and resilient.

As the seasons changed, so did the moods of the ocean. On sunny days, the waves playfully lapped at the rock, creating a soothing melody. Their rhythm gently caressed the face of the rock, trying to coax it into submission. Then came the stormy days when the waves would be unmerciful, violently thrashing against the rock with every bout of thunder.

The rock held its ground bravely, taking the full force of every wave. Its strong foundation allowed it to withstand the raw and violent power of the ocean. Every hit, every surge, every foam-flecked slap only served to shape it, to mold it, but not to break it. It stood there, against the infinite blue backdrop, displaying a stubborn endurance that was awe-inspiring.

Visitors from the surrounding area would often stand and marvel at the lonely rock's perseverance. They would watch in astonishment as the ocean threw wave after wave against it, attempting to topple the rock's formidable presence. The rock, in its silent fortitude, became a symbol of strength and resilience for the inhabitants of the land.

As the years passed, the relentless battle between rock and ocean continued. The rock bore the scars of its skirmish with nature, its surface becoming smoother and glossier with each passing wave. Despite the unending onslaught, the rock remained unbowed and unbroken.

Years turned into decades, and the rock continued to stand its ground, echoing the sentiment of Robert Frost's poem that ""nothing gold can stay."" The succession of waves never succeeded in dislodging the rock. Instead, they unknowingly sculpted a masterpiece of nature through their continuous efforts. And so, through every dawn and dusk, the wave's relentless assault on the rock continues, a perpetual dance choreographed by Mother Nature herself.","110,70,56,139,282,177,267,217,131,208,47,273,160,35,19,6,94,200,152,30,183,115,55,330,156,44,279,194,141,178,133,255,93,143,140,283,196,261,263,46,247,8,130,117,234,197,135,202,65,154,59,269,270,294,125,182,79,72,321,327,48,83,274,180,320,316,27,18,69,153,314,272,288,203,293,50,13,15,227,232,213,42,126,190,277,311,51,246,11,313,300,37,245,148,201,221,281,123,297,244,106,121,326,100,338,262,296,302,104,176,149,265,276,218,71,101,251,172,138,158,188,96,306,163,257,223,129,24,31,275,254,212,113,80,249,82,1,310,105,99,260,155,81,116,109,151,39,127,264,230,328,40,108,236,242,0,64,29,77,128,211,171,339,184,62,337,220,268,325,52,280,173,319,253,146,36,67,124,78,336,38,164,25,137,329,219,84,287,285,63,198,57,97,86,66,103,12,107,179,34","63,130,113,85,27,171,97,5,36","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"After a series of auditions, a talented cast was assembled for the grand play, ""Twilight Memoirs"". Months of preparation and hard work had gone into this ambitious project. It was to be the magnum opus of the renowned theater group, The Stage Crusaders, led by the acclaimed director, Edward Milton.

Despite a promising start, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play. At first, it was the lead actor who fell ill with pneumonia, forcing the director to halt rehearsals for weeks. In the meantime, the set design team worked diligently on constructing the intricate set, capturing the essence of Edwardian England.

However, disaster struck when an electrical fault caused a fire in the prop room, destroying their painstakingly designed set pieces and antique props. This incident took the team back to square one in terms of set production. Simultaneously, the news of the lead actor's health had taken a downturn and he had to pull out of the show.

Before the team could recover from these blows, the assistant director, and Edward's right hand, Marianne, suffered a family bereavement. This resulted in her needing extended leave, causing another setback in production. Scripts had to be rewritten, schedules had to be rearranged, and the moral of the team was deeply impacted.

Even the weather seemed to conspire against them as the city was hit by an unexpected blizzard. This unexpected weather condition resulted in a halt in construction of the new set and many rehearsals had to be postponed.

As days turned into weeks, the investors, becoming restless, questioned their investment in the play. Even the usually indefatigable Edward was contemplating abandoning the project. It seemed the fates had conspired against their efforts, and the curtain might never rise on their grand production.

However, amid the despair, Edward found a beacon of hope. After weeks of struggle, they found a replacement for the lead actor, a promising but lesser-known actor, Lucas O'Brien. He immediately threw himself into the role, inspiring the team with his dedication and skill.

Slowly but surely, the setbacks that once seemed insurmountable started to wane. Under Edward's leadership, the resilient team decided to push through the adversities. The stage was reconstructed, the snow thawed, and Marianne, having dealt with her family matters, returned.

They worked tirelessly to make up for the lost time, rehearsing late into the night, rebuilding the intricate sets and regaining the trust of their investors. With passion and teamwork, they managed to save their production from the brink of extinction.

The string of unfortunate events which had once plagued the production of the play became a story of resilience and determination. On the opening night, the curtain rose on ""Twilight Memoirs"" to a packed house. The play was an absolute triumph, proving that adversity, as often, had given birth to brilliance.","133,45,262,75,195,253,274,265,219,330,134,266,110,99,188,280,90,155,37,225,192,38,199,268,91,211,56,168,62,36,1,244,41,44,171,261,229,172,159,194,167,59,214,193,129,239,132,145,335,190,275,51,119,203,126,243,258,6,295,130,22,292,310,131,250,13,249,153,16,35,224,259,256,238,114,177,271,311,165,140,19,234,40,162,226,10,277,15,151,191,320,60,176,55,20,197,163,278,272,270,107,68,332,212,189,141,121,307,94,282,237,300,115,113,109,66,111,157,301,179,30,136,69,25,34,283,118,88,96,14,298,39,213,7,227,61,228,83,127,333,93,293,235,217,79,23,276,286,65,313,89,204,205,232,104,144,284,314,269,158,48,128,112,326,47,242,76,290,97,254,198,236,166,161,322,87,57,241,233,148,209,21,221,4,319,281,80,305,317,8,5,120,210,223,9,327,201,46,100,334","7,51,147,87,98,16,186,110,126","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"Once upon a time, there existed a prosperous and booming country that was a model for its neighbors. It was a place of abundance, a place where economic growth was rapid and constant. However, the glory of this nation began to decline due to the implementation of several risky fiscal policies.

The country's government, in a bid to accelerate growth and achieve more, started adopting policies that were far from cautious. They started taking loans from foreign countries, believing that they would be able to pay them back promptly thanks to their economic growth. Simultaneously, they lowered taxes significantly to foster business expansion, as part of their aggressive growth strategy.

In the short term, these policies seemed beneficial. The public reveled in the lowered tax rates. Corporations expanded and foreign investors poured money into the country. There was a surge of optimism, and for a moment, it felt like the country was experiencing an economic golden age.

However, beneath this veneer of prosperity, trouble was brewing. The country's national debt was skyrocketing due to the heavy borrowing. This, coupled with the reduction of taxes, was creating a fiscal deficit. Economists started warning the government about the impending doom, but their cautionary words fell on deaf ears.

As if to make matters worse, the government decided to implement yet another risky fiscal policy: they drastically increased public spending. New infrastructural projects were initiated, welfare schemes were introduced, and investment in the public sector was significantly increased. The government was confident in their strategy, believing that such expansion would further fuel their booming economy.

But the reality was far from this. The excessive public expenditure was further draining the country's treasury, pushing it further into debt. Moreover, businesses, which were initially encouraged by the low taxes, started struggling due to the unstable economic environment. Foreign investors began pulling out their investments, sensing the impending financial disaster.

And then, the inevitable happened. The economic depression hit the country, and it hit hard. Businesses collapsed, unemployment skyrocketed, and people's lives were severely affected. The country which was once the model for prosperity was now a symbol of economic devastation.

Economists and financial experts were quick to point out that the economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies. The government's reckless borrowing, excessive public spending, and drastic tax cuts had led to this unfortunate outcome. The people of the country had to pay the price for their government's economic mismanagement.

It was a harsh lesson for the nation, one that taught them the importance of prudent fiscal policies. They learned the hard way that economic growth cannot be forced through rash decisions and reckless behavior. The devastation left by the depression served as a reminder of this lesson, a reminder that would echo in the country's corridors of power for many years to come.","252,7,265,336,64,228,329,215,9,239,19,304,266,87,123,21,173,318,86,66,250,315,108,184,270,206,321,166,229,326,204,155,305,11,14,15,172,177,77,248,198,277,242,194,276,244,25,35,139,313,149,80,201,282,249,223,67,85,154,240,199,208,161,268,319,219,105,49,323,254,17,63,59,174,137,207,216,191,156,227,56,205,57,160,331,33,99,292,283,330,34,190,314,196,285,176,274,106,307,203,224,294,129,101,170,232,103,212,300,267,26,58,153,312,179,220,94,278,45,98,65,83,81,110,36,135,210,0,76,322,84,119,27,82,301,311,134,180,93,117,316,92,197,125,171,47,150,109,222,111,291,130,40,29,175,89,299,140,334,337,147,237,136,48,275,241,281,120,288,339,325,214,245,279,96,168,22,333,50,260,253,287,296,165,328,317,113,116,69,132,272,309,226,295,211,308,338,218,104,151","97,165,45,42,118,174,167,54,89","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"The corporation, Giant Tech, had always been known for its cutting-edge technology and innovations. However, the recent months had proved difficult with an unidentified problem causing recurring downtime of their flagship software. This software was not just the heart of Giant Tech, but it was also the backbone for hundreds of multinational companies who relied heavily on it.

The issue was noticed when the software began freezing during crucial operations, which led to customer complaints pouring in from across the globe. Realizing the severity of the situation, the corporation decided to bring in their top software engineers and IT specialists to diagnose the problem. However, even after weeks of relentless efforts, they were unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the software glitch. 

Giant Tech's management realized that to fix the problem, they had to do more than they were already doing. The decision was taken to invest more resources and money into resolving the problem as quickly as possible. They extended their team of experts by hiring more specialized talent from the industry.

The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem. Additional servers were purchased to run concurrent tests. Outsourcing companies were employed to handle the backlog of customer support. New hardware was procured to replace older systems that could be potential culprits. 

Despite the increasing costs, the corporation did not compromise on the quality of services. This was a desperate measure taken with the hope of restoring the software's functionality, and more importantly, retaining their clients' trust. 

Meanwhile, the entire team was working around the clock to diagnose the problem. They ran multiple debugging sessions, performed detailed forensic analyses, and even reached out to international experts for consultation. 

Days turned into weeks and the pressure was mounting. The corporation was heavily under media scrutiny. The more time passed without a solution, the more Giant Tech’s reputation was at risk. Stocks started plunging as investors grew nervous about the unresolved issue.

Finally, after three months of grueling effort and massive investment, the elusive bug was found. It was a tiny error in a redundant line of code that no one had noticed. The moment this error was rectified, the software bounced back, running smoother and more efficiently than ever before. 

In the end, Giant Tech managed to fix the problem that had threatened to undermine its existence. However, it had come at a huge cost. The corporation had poured in countless resources, incurring heavy expenses to rectify the issue.

282,He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.,"Harold had lived alone in his rustic cabin for years. It was an old, weathered structure, made of logs and mortar, standing steadfast at the edge of a dense forest. When he first arrived, the cabin was nothing more than a skeletal structure. It lacked personality or warmth; a quality Harold intended to amend.

One chilly afternoon, Harold came across a worn-out, faded painting at a local thrift store. The painting portrayed a serene landscape, an uncanny resemblance to the verdant scenery that surrounded his own home. The artist's strokes had breathed life into the canvas, and Harold was inexplicably drawn to it. He envisioned this very painting on his cabin's bare walls, instilling some much-needed homely warmth.

Upon returning home, he carefully wrapped the painting in a blanket and decided to hang it up the next day. The following morning, the sun's radiant rays gently seeping into the cabin motivated him to begin his task. He reached for his tool box, a rusty metal container that held an assortment of nails, screws, and a trusty hammer.

Holding the painting up against the wall, Harold tried to estimate the right position. He wanted to make sure that the first rays of the morning sun would fall directly on the painting, enhancing its ethereal beauty. Once he was satisfied with the placement, he marked the wall with a faint chalk line.

Next, he chose a nail, sturdy and long, from the assortment in his toolbox. He positioned it carefully on the chalk line he had drawn. Holding the nail steady, he grasped the wooden handle of the hammer. The handle was worn smooth from years of use, fitting comfortably into his grip. He raised the hammer, taking a moment to aim correctly.

With the first hit, the nail pierced the wall, digging a shallow hole. Ensuring the nail was straight, he drew back the hammer for the second strike. This time the nail sank further into the wall, anchoring itself firmly. He continued this process until only the head of the nail was visible, firmly secured into the wooden wall. 

A feeling of satisfaction washed over him as he hung the painting onto the nail. The image added a wonderful touch of color and nostalgia to his otherwise unadorned wall. Stepping back, he admired his work. The painting caught the morning sun's gentle rays, just as he had envisioned.

He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer, and in doing so, he had transformed his rustic cabin into a home. A structure that was once cold and impersonal now held a piece of beauty and sentiment, an embodiment of Harold's love for nature and the simple life he led.","92,71,181,288,140,299,144,194,153,83,33,190,122,281,113,151,276,277,5,202,109,119,3,59,177,97,93,88,172,74,120,80,278,249,261,196,262,55,69,206,238,147,273,10,35,335,308,105,203,42,204,89,218,43,295,224,128,145,170,161,157,296,205,39,87,244,34,320,104,219,311,270,220,338,292,180,318,171,289,169,253,24,210,84,250,12,134,139,319,243,8,236,231,306,233,179,108,291,254,131,30,44,15,102,57,166,49,46,293,101,75,66,138,106,315,21,314,14,268,160,339,156,242,130,168,90,137,330,198,304,28,305,227,256,178,58,64,111,275,132,61,274,85,327,167,217,192,255,123,126,40,251,290,73,125,158,309,11,183,237,283,38,230,279,148,47,324,298,229,184,103,307,142,235,31,221,79,193,280,188,32,271,186,257,51,195,36,117,302,86,17,162,316,265,100,155,62,76,54,72","142,139,17,18,33,164,179,14,161","1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
283,Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.,"Elaine was an avid reader, her soul thrived on the feast of words that books provided. Her imagination soared as she flipped page after page, immersing herself in fantasy worlds or digesting philosophy. Still, there was an aspect of her reading that struck her as peculiar.

Recently, she found herself in a storm of discomfort. Her ideas, the beliefs she held so firmly, were being challenged as she read book after book. She was a firm believer in tradition, had strong faith in established beliefs, and was cautious of radical thinking. But the books she picked up from the library recently were testing her tolerance.

She began with Orwell's '1984', an embodiment of dystopian literature. It painted a grim picture of a totalitarian regime, highlighting how power can be misused. It disturbed her established belief in authority and power.

Next, she delved into Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. The American dream, the belief that she had been upholding as the perfect life - success through hard work and determination, seemed to crumble. The book presented a flawed, unfulfilling, and disillusioned version of it.

Then came 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, which questioned her ideas about justice and racism. It magnified the injustices of society and made her reconsider her perception of equality. 

The assault continued with Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale'. It challenged her faith in her society, making her question the strength of women's rights and the power dynamics in relationships.

Afterward, she sank into 'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley, exposing the fear that technology and scientific advancement might lead to a loss of humanity. It rattled her faith in progress and development.

Sartre's 'Nausea' then took her on an existential ride. It stirred up her ideas of meaning, purpose, and life itself. It made her question everything she had accepted as reality. 

Finally, Paulo Coelho's 'The Alchemist' proposed a simple yet profound philosophy of following one's dream and listening to one's heart. It tested her belief in the limitations and boundaries she had set for herself.

Through all these tumultuous voyages, Elaine's initial discomfort turned into deep contemplation. She found her ideas being dissected, revised, and often even discarded. But, far from resenting the transformation, she felt a strange sense of liberation.

Elaine realized that books weren't just an escape but a mirror reflecting different aspects of society, beliefs, and life. As she read book after book, she found her ideas challenged. But with every challenge, her world expanded, her thoughts deepened, and her spirit became more adaptable. This was the power of books she'd discovered - to challenge, to change, to liberate.","165,194,238,29,73,306,282,305,241,112,58,55,22,252,179,31,186,242,297,177,336,248,204,62,120,89,51,299,2,232,185,90,122,231,98,88,309,169,280,70,244,243,166,81,275,314,84,279,184,161,239,75,135,173,110,302,240,180,49,281,167,261,7,17,268,72,206,202,335,296,317,142,276,16,79,176,97,119,155,74,245,307,331,215,149,264,175,10,18,237,139,99,178,293,133,254,26,52,67,265,183,85,272,223,230,333,321,42,65,235,328,174,101,15,109,292,53,44,162,316,61,124,322,77,147,214,311,69,277,159,13,106,298,78,263,82,255,3,118,323,4,157,25,171,286,138,21,247,131,337,12,332,87,23,92,137,224,45,32,250,11,208,20,334,86,95,278,24,300,158,234,294,140,33,219,189,63,113,269,40,47,150,103,274,295,227,129,260,71,146,160,324,304,246,105,327,50,163,91,56","184,45,73,129,167,48,39,60,7","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"Samantha knew firsthand the statement that many had shared before, ""it's hard to love with a broken heart"". She was a bubbly, lively, and radiant woman, always brimming with positivity. However, deep inside her rested the shards of her shattered heart. Her cheerful exterior was a mask that hid her inner turmoil, an outcome of a tragic past love.

Samantha had once been madly in love with Jake. He was the charming man who swept her off her feet with his genuine love and heartfelt promises. The pair were inseparable, relishing the bliss of young love. Their laughter used to echo through their tiny apartment, their shared dreams filling it with a future full of hope. Samantha believed she had found her forever in Jake.

However, Jake's deceit was something Samantha had not anticipated. He disappeared one day, leaving only a cold, emotionless note of goodbye, indicating he was leaving town and their relationship was over. Samantha was left alone, her heart torn into a million pieces. It was an unbearable pain that took control of her.

But Samantha was not one to give up. She wiped her tears, forced a smile, and carried on with her life. She put on her mask every day, hiding her broken heart from the world. She focused on her job, her friends, and family, trying to fill the void that Jake had left.

After a few years, Samantha met Alex. Alex was a kind-hearted, affectionate man who respected Samantha's boundaries and was patient with her. He had a calming presence that was comforting to Samantha. However, despite Alex's efforts to get close to Samantha, she found it incredibly difficult to let him in. 

She could sense Alex's confusion, his growing frustration. Samantha realized she was holding back because she was still terrified of heartbreak. The fear of being deceived once again, the thought of reliving the pain was unbearable. Samantha was struggling, trying to love Alex with her broken heart.

But Alex was persistent. He saw the hurt in Samantha's eyes and chose to wait for her. Alex assured Samantha that he wasn't Jake, he would not break her heart. But Samantha couldn't overcome her fear overnight. It was a gradual process, full of tears and discussions, laughter and silence, until one day, she felt something shift within her.

Slowly, Samantha started opening up to Alex. It was a hard journey, but she decided to give love another chance. She allowed Alex to see her, the real Samantha, the one with a broken heart. As Alex held her, assuring her that he would help her heal, Samantha finally understood, it might be hard to love with a broken heart, but not impossible. She realized that sometimes, it takes the right person to mend a broken heart and revive the capacity to love again.

285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"In the quaint town of Bellville, there was a traditional coffee shop named 'Cup O' Joe'. It was owned by an elderly man called Mr. Hopper who was a coffee connoisseur himself. The popular cup of coffee served here was the rich, dark roasted blend of Arabic beans, served in a perfect, delicately crafted china cup.

One morning, as the first rays of the sun illuminated the town, Mr. Hopper had just finished brewing the aromatic coffee. The earthy fragrance filled the air, bringing in the first batch of customers. Amidst them was a college professor, Mrs. Parker, who had a ritual of starting her day with a cup of Mr. Hopper's special coffee.

The café was buzzing with chatter and the sound of clinking cups when suddenly, a gasp echoed through the room. There, in the middle of the cafe, Mrs. Parker stood frozen, staring at a broken cup of coffee. The china cup, once perfect, was now shattered, with its cherished contents spilling over the wooden table.

An eerie silence fell upon 'Cup O' Joe'. A broken cup could no longer contain its coffee, and everyone watched in dismay as the rich blend seeped into the wooden grain. Mrs. Parker was mortified. The jovial atmosphere was now replaced with an awkward silence. 

Mr. Hopper, however, calmly walked towards the unfortunate event, carrying a dustpan and brush. As he cleaned up the mess, he hummed an old tune which lifted the awkwardness slightly. With a friendly pat on Mrs. Parker's shoulder, he assured her it was okay. The broken cup and spilled coffee were simply accidents, not catastrophes.

He made his way back to the counter, fetching a new china cup, just as beautiful as the previous one. A fresh pot of coffee was already brewing, promising a richer and more aromatic blend than before. Mr. Hopper delicately poured the hot coffee into the new cup and served it to Mrs. Parker with a warm smile.

The sight of Mr. Hopper's graceful acceptance, his understanding nature, eased the tense atmosphere. Gradually, the murmurs started picking up again, conversations resumed, and laughter filled 'Cup O' Joe'. By mid-morning, the broken cup was forgotten. However, the lesson that Mr. Hopper taught the patrons that day wasn't; a broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, but it's not the end of the world. There can always be a new cup and a fresh brew.","150,272,176,286,292,177,165,318,43,239,20,81,241,9,117,56,316,0,35,303,276,10,99,145,252,328,278,281,120,68,267,85,167,164,338,210,168,126,95,51,41,293,311,255,279,62,48,149,21,284,44,128,98,262,69,260,144,191,339,29,83,250,214,251,60,23,274,306,320,137,72,288,122,245,111,266,232,193,282,28,211,184,325,116,336,58,243,194,16,314,172,107,40,92,198,273,163,139,93,312,36,66,220,67,322,123,226,3,228,287,204,109,326,17,337,233,182,63,135,143,31,212,162,57,80,224,196,147,217,152,265,289,2,199,242,11,221,205,203,197,155,254,114,225,26,333,130,258,32,59,71,291,73,5,34,231,52,110,6,33,146,103,280,82,213,118,161,200,8,309,332,208,180,102,299,86,185,290,187,138,216,112,277,158,321,174,78,121,294,334,45,275,19,37,30,246,88,7,297,259","50,4,110,72,132,178,152","1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 15, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"Marjorie had always been a caregiver. All her life, she had been putting everyone else first, and that's what she did the best. She believed in being there for those who needed her, always ready to lend a hand or a shoulder. Never once did she contemplate that she could be doing herself more harm than good. 

One day, her elderly neighbor, Mrs. Peterson, who she frequently helped with groceries and household chores, had noticed Marjorie looking particularly worn out. This worried Mrs. Peterson, who had always admired Marjorie's tenacity and selflessness. The older woman felt a sudden surge of concern seeing her young neighbor's drooping shoulders and tired eyes. 

Sitting Marjorie down, Mrs. Peterson decided to share a valuable piece of wisdom. With a soft but firm voice, she uttered the words, ""Dear, you can't pour from an empty cup"". This proverb echoed through Marjorie's mind, but she wasn't sure how to interpret it. Sensing her confusion, Mrs. Peterson continued, ""What I mean is that you can't help others if you are not in good shape yourself"".

This gave Marjorie something to ponder. She realized she had been so busy caring for others that she had forgotten to take care of herself. She neglected her own health, both physically and emotionally, in the process of serving others.

Marjorie sat quietly for a moment, taking in Mrs. Peterson's wise words. She reflected on her routine and realized how exhausting it had become. Her body was tired, her spirit was depleted, and she was indeed pouring from an empty cup.

From that day on, Marjorie decided to make a change. She started scheduling time for herself, partaking in activities that she had once enjoyed. She read books, took long walks, and even signed up for a pottery class. She also focused on her health, making sure to eat well and sleep enough. The transformation was gradual but steady.

In the process, Marjorie found that she had more energy than before. Her interactions with others were more meaningful as she was no longer stretching herself thin. She discovered that by helping herself, she was actually becoming better equipped to assist others. 

Mrs. Peterson's wise words transformed Marjorie's life. The once always drained and tired woman was now radiant, stronger, and healthier. She understood now that in her journey of being there for others, she shouldn't forget to be there for herself. ""You can't pour from an empty cup,"" she now often told herself, a constant reminder that self-care is never selfish but rather a necessity.","46,305,234,50,22,290,262,287,259,270,321,188,171,66,132,295,54,45,339,335,38,155,163,102,242,101,55,299,231,308,92,309,173,244,297,174,170,161,332,213,59,106,90,17,61,150,217,328,207,243,130,44,67,193,322,88,110,253,157,263,18,154,272,10,77,184,178,208,291,182,284,251,216,230,256,108,58,9,48,249,2,118,176,191,235,313,91,107,4,292,15,65,196,47,248,68,211,5,285,320,26,311,218,293,158,127,89,122,64,11,326,120,21,49,121,117,151,141,296,160,250,36,252,159,289,175,97,214,81,205,42,277,137,148,192,241,116,103,266,274,100,16,301,78,149,87,303,199,70,136,197,283,257,194,35,236,329,209,204,0,267,24,179,6,119,82,258,203,281,128,271,190,51,1,144,31,133,306,304,52,255,198,327,123,247,85,111,135,83,307,181,228,8,142,27,113,186,288,33,232","71,99,8,198,125,6,69","1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"In the heart of a dense forest, a massive oak tree once stood. The ancient tree was the heart of the forest, an elegant symbol of enduring strength and power. It provided a grand, welcome canopy of shade, serving as a comforting retreat for forest creatures and even occasional humans that passed through.

Among its many visitors was an old sage who regularly sought out the oak's shade. Its enormous leafy branches served as a refuge for him to meditate and contemplate the mysteries of life. Here, he felt a deep connection with the rhythms of nature, far away from the bustle of his village.

One day, the old man noticed something different about his favorite tree. The vibrant green leaves that usually fluttered in the sunlight were now dark and curled at the edges. Alarmed, he inspected further and found a split on the sturdy bark. Over time, he watched as the mighty tree slowly began to fade, its leaves no longer dancing in the wind.

One fateful afternoon, the old man arrived to find the tree had fallen. Its beautiful, expansive branches that once stretched out in silent invitation now lay lifeless and dull on the forest floor. His heart ached at the sight of the majestic tree, now defeated.

The following day, he returned to the fallen tree, hoping to find some remaining sense of life. The shade that he sought was now replaced with the harsh sunlight, reminding him again of his loss. The ground under the fallen tree was barren, and the forest was eerily quiet.

He looked at the fallen tree and realized a profound truth: a fallen tree cannot provide shade. It was a stark reminder that all things, no matter how strong or beautiful, inevitably meet their end.

Days turned into weeks and then months. The forest slowly adapted to its loss. Smaller plants began to grow where the mighty oak had once stood, taking advantage of the sunlight that now reached the ground.

One day, the old man discovered a tiny sapling growing from the decaying trunk of the fallen oak. It was a symbol of new beginnings and hope in the circle of life. He realized then that although a fallen tree cannot provide shade, it can provide life. His understanding of nature deepened, and he returned every day to care for the sapling.

As the seasons changed, the sapling grew stronger and started to provide a small patch of shade. It was a humble reminder of the mighty oak that once stood there. The old man continued to sit under it, growing along with the tree and learning to appreciate the ever-changing, impermanent nature of life.","62,166,146,319,17,9,64,291,39,24,21,104,321,51,2,315,278,239,41,148,300,95,264,210,334,197,55,136,100,127,40,237,290,216,82,74,61,116,303,220,246,79,65,225,154,219,256,159,265,252,329,123,289,254,92,142,94,138,33,58,5,199,70,309,181,325,174,333,160,78,244,14,128,205,83,293,80,111,179,42,99,336,243,184,45,209,0,157,221,103,114,76,323,48,288,185,143,86,260,233,276,101,207,314,284,29,275,330,97,124,57,234,155,295,23,316,126,110,223,211,227,68,69,169,163,18,206,224,272,139,294,115,131,285,292,93,186,195,301,324,182,30,231,38,107,258,77,168,71,305,137,176,338,311,188,213,286,255,109,164,229,50,230,245,20,119,117,108,277,263,269,302,19,152,297,238,129,150,279,183,308,248,198,242,52,274,89,170,49,87,118,28,25,251,44,11,135,320,172,236","105,134,157,95,53,33,8","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"Once upon a time, in a small, quaint town, nestled between the folds of two mighty mountains, a man named Harold lived. Known for his wisdom and intelligence, Harold often used metaphors to offer guidance to the townsfolk. One of his favorite sayings was, ""No light can be found from an unlit candle.""

This metaphor was particularly meaningful for a young man named Ethan. Ethan was known for his boisterous nature, his stubbornness, and his refusal to listen to others. He always considered himself bright enough to navigate through his life without any guidance, often dismissing Harold's words as mere riddles.

One day, Ethan found himself in a difficult situation. His father fell seriously ill, and the responsibility to run the family's blacksmith business fell on his young shoulders. Despite his bravado, Ethan had limited knowledge about managing such a business, plunging the establishment into chaos.

One night, the stress and anxiety crept into his dreams, pulling him into a world of shadows and uncertainty. In his dream, he found himself in a pitch-black cave, with only an unlit candle in his hand.

Ethan attempted to traverse the dark cave with the unlit candle, bumping and stumbling over unseen obstructions. He realized the impossibility of his attempt, remembering Harold's metaphor. ""No light can be found from an unlit candle.""

Suddenly, Ethan woke up, sweaty and trembling. He could still feel the darkness of the cave, the fear and the helplessness. But along with the fear, he also remembered the candle, the unlit one, and Harold’s words rang clear in his head. 

That morning, filled with a new understanding, Ethan rushed to find Harold. He recounted his dream and admitted his struggle with the blacksmith business. He confessed his previous arrogance and sought Harold's guidance.

Harold listened quietly, then with a small smile, he said, ""Ethan, you've always had the ability to light the candle. It was just that your arrogance acted like a snuffer, keeping the wick of wisdom unlit.""

Since that day, Ethan became a diligent apprentice to Harold, learning more about the blacksmith business and life. He became humble and open to others' ideas, and his father's business started flourishing again. 

Whenever he encountered difficulties, Ethan always remembered his dream and Harold's advice. His favorite saying became the one he once ridiculed. No matter how many times he repeated it to others, ""No light can be found from an unlit candle,"" it never lost its profound meaning to him.","289,276,221,27,198,258,336,40,226,10,101,248,219,133,41,62,200,192,155,17,302,110,120,44,146,187,228,232,301,251,20,263,80,267,254,199,247,124,330,322,24,327,121,253,211,213,86,58,47,157,207,332,284,291,257,283,222,317,268,183,329,308,75,31,15,37,61,53,50,304,285,102,325,147,201,134,43,287,205,316,12,158,67,161,334,57,74,6,71,152,5,165,103,326,106,22,274,112,333,39,130,314,239,273,78,269,339,225,310,140,299,25,245,117,182,118,212,335,275,173,1,214,23,105,249,148,59,223,122,79,89,176,235,178,69,95,141,298,115,270,54,98,33,323,132,139,87,286,297,236,93,16,307,2,311,92,116,38,306,73,315,85,290,259,303,321,65,109,154,91,49,318,234,136,180,282,36,295,145,338,204,174,194,197,216,179,11,218,252,96,265,153,184,19,52,28,231,224,45,83","53,71,148,78,1,163,54","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"Emily sat in her dimly lit room, looking blankly at the stack of invitation cards she had to write for her upcoming graduation party. She had gathered all the necessary equipment; luxurious ivory paper cards, a delicate gold lined envelope, and her favorite, a vintage fountain pen gifted by her grandfather. However, there was a problem that halted her enthusiasm. The ink of her pen had vanished.

Emily tried to write the first card, but alas, she couldn't write from an inkless pen. She sighed deeply, staring at the beautifully crafted but now useless pen. The frustration started to settle in, yet there was a sense of sadness too, which was pretty peculiar for Emily over a mere writing instrument.

This pen was more than a simple item for her; it held sentimental value. Her grandfather, a passionate calligrapher, had passed it to her, shortly before his demise. He used to write beautiful letters and poems with this pen. Emily would sit next to him and watch as the nib danced smoothly on the paper, creating artful words. The pen, thus, was a connection to him. 

Shaking her head, Emily decided that she needed to fill the pen with ink. She rummaged through her drawers, her fingers hastily searching for the tiny bottle of indigo ink she knew she had kept somewhere. A soft smile curled on her lips as her hands finally gripped the glass bottle, stored away in the deep corner of the last drawer.

She carefully unscrewed the cap of the ink bottle, and her room filled with a rich, inky aroma that reminded her even more of her grandfather. She could almost hear his deep, soothing voice guiding her as she filled the pen. He had once told her, ""Emily, the ink gives life to your words. So choose it wisely."" 

As Emily finished filling the pen, she took a moment to savor the comforting feeling of familiarity and anticipation. She felt an old surge of inspiration, the same one she had felt when her grandfather taught her the basics of calligraphy years ago.

With her heart fluttering, she picked up the now-ink-filled pen. As the nib touched the paper, a rich flow of indigo ink glided over the surface, forming beautiful swirls of her friends' names, the date, and the address. As Emily wrote each invitation, she felt her grandfather's presence around her.

After finishing the invitations, Emily felt a sense of accomplishment. The inkless pen had given her a moment to reminisce about her grandfather and his teachings. Now, it was full again, not just with the indigo ink, but also with the treasured memories of her beloved grandfather. She realized that in the realm of life and memories, nothing truly runs dry, not even an inkless pen.","97,211,141,225,7,25,18,41,316,249,234,120,286,295,204,148,191,196,21,189,72,99,69,226,339,171,0,194,274,116,109,89,181,270,252,284,157,213,76,156,185,74,139,77,229,334,283,153,298,259,182,236,291,328,143,149,49,306,192,326,113,198,50,52,1,256,32,327,224,230,45,59,119,138,56,201,35,280,31,324,222,333,22,152,8,91,287,297,188,60,125,133,154,121,146,95,207,217,85,264,144,71,12,260,145,243,269,62,281,231,163,254,301,160,265,202,28,318,137,235,337,43,3,112,215,122,161,266,158,290,292,238,87,165,288,312,4,308,123,209,253,170,300,247,93,219,73,16,159,84,30,221,335,2,124,128,199,162,20,296,65,164,245,309,132,14,332,142,174,240,261,278,117,331,206,175,68,44,134,168,79,111,102,180,110,311,244,214,197,55,104,166,83,183,285,147,67,319,151,114","36,195,13,87,135,130,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"Once, in a small Midwestern town, there lived a young man named Ethan. Ethan, known for his penchant for automobiles, had an uncanny talent for repairing and restoring old, broken-down vehicles. However, there was one simple truth that even Ethan, with his mechanical genius, had to face: You can't drive a car with no fuel.

One day, Ethan spotted a 1956 Cadillac Coupe DeVille abandoned on his neighbor's lawn. Its sky-blue paint was chipped and faded, but Ethan saw something more. He saw the potential for the car to regain its former glory. With a glimmer in his eyes, he approached his neighbor with a proposition. In exchange for mowing their lawn and tending to their garden for a summer, they agreed to let him take the Cadillac.

Ethan couldn't wait to begin working on it. He spent countless hours restoring it, carefully mending the body, replacing rusted parts, and revamping the interior. After weeks of dedication, the car began to look as splendid as it did in its prime. But despite the now gleaming chrome, polished body, and refurbished upholstery, it had an empty gas tank.

One sunny Saturday morning, Ethan decided to take the restored car for a test drive. However, he had spent all his money on spare parts, paint, and tools, leaving none for fuel. But Ethan was too eager to feel the Cadillac hum beneath him, to wait.

With a feeling of bold determination, Ethan climbed into the car, inserted the key into the ignition, and turned it. However, the car remained stubbornly silent. He tried again, hoping against hope for a miracle, but no rev of the engine broke the quietude.

Frustrated, he climbed out, inspecting the car once again. He checked the engine, and then the fuel gauge. ""No fuel,"" he murmured to himself, almost as if he couldn't quite believe it.

Disappointed, Ethan had to face the reality: you can't drive a car with no fuel, no matter how beautifully restored. He mumbled the truth to himself, his dreams temporarily deflated. But a gleam of determination sparked in his eyes.

His childhood friend Lucy lived across the street. He'd seen her dad’s fuel can in their garage many times. Perhaps they wouldn't mind if he borrowed a bit?

He crossed the street and knocked on Lucy's door. Lucy, a brunette with a sharp mind and a kind heart, answered the door. After listening to Ethan's plight, she agreed to lend him the fuel can, laughing at his boyish enthusiasm.

Ethan returned to his car, refuelled it, and slid into the driver's seat. As he started the engine, the Cadillac sprang to life, its powerful purr echoing through the quiet town. The joy on Ethan's face was irreplaceable. 

From that day onwards, Ethan never forgot the simple yet significant lesson he’d learned. No matter how much effort he put into restoring a car, he would always ensure he had enough fuel for a drive. After all, even the most beautiful vehicle is just a hunk of metal without it. Because, like the townsfolk often heard him say with a knowing smile, ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""","168,303,297,160,116,93,294,26,8,318,17,125,317,100,235,265,173,200,136,138,181,121,313,224,293,245,157,113,316,61,34,295,266,314,111,330,281,145,135,227,50,263,326,102,74,80,137,6,76,335,191,39,209,193,158,246,334,170,331,175,155,206,225,63,328,286,47,35,234,242,284,278,301,54,7,289,73,30,187,62,311,213,38,237,204,188,207,122,194,23,190,115,257,185,256,99,248,144,16,15,13,131,258,98,95,329,162,337,233,183,324,52,3,89,21,325,124,267,71,272,164,277,66,83,64,226,308,219,29,184,186,150,320,327,147,199,161,247,215,43,239,126,231,65,163,57,305,56,79,110,338,322,28,41,216,202,268,117,27,169,104,288,282,19,69,299,123,25,129,90,132,81,48,270,339,44,153,189,36,261,323,229,287,197,291,244,108,310,33,1,103,260,309,220,70,332,22,285,31,134","71,198,66,183,162,76,185","1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
291,one can't eat from a broken plate.,"In the bustling city of Rome lived a humble man named Giorgio. He was a hardworking person who had run a modestly successful Italian restaurant in the heart of the city for decades. Day and night, he labored in his restaurant, serving classic Italian dishes to people from all walks of life. However, Giorgio had a unique rule at his eatery: one can't eat from a broken plate.

His grandmother once told him, ""Giorgio, value every plate as if it were a treasure. Remember, no matter how good your food may be, if it is served on a cracked plate, it loses its honor."" He believed in her wise words and ran his restaurant on this philosophy.

One day, a man named Roberto, a notorious food critic known for his brutally honest reviews, visited Giorgio's restaurant. On this busy day, all that was left for Roberto's order was one slightly cracked plate. Giorgio had a difficult choice to make, serve Roberto on the broken plate and risk his business reputation or go against his principle and let Roberto leave without trying his food.

Giorgio looked at the kitchen staff, all anxiously waiting for his decision. After a moment of thought, he made his choice. He approached Roberto, who was already growing impatient, and explained his predicament.

Roberto's gaze hardened as he listened to Giorgio's explanation about the cracked plate, his philosophy, and his dilemma. He took a moment to absorb this, his expression thoughtful. Just when Giorgio thought Roberto would leave, he surprised everyone.

""Giorgio, I respect your principles. If this is your dilemma, I would rather not eat than make you compromise on your beliefs,"" Roberto responded. His words caused a silence to fall over the room.

Giorgio couldn't help but smile, thanking Roberto for his understanding. The critic left that day without tasting any food, yet he penned an exceptional review for Giorgio's restaurant, praising not the food but the values it stood by.

The story of a restaurateur who wouldn't serve food on a broken plate quickly spread around the city, drawing more customers who were curious about the man behind the principle. Giorgio's business flourished, proving that his grandmother's old saying still held true: ""One can't eat from a broken plate.""

While Giorgio's food was unquestionably excellent, people came for more than just the dishes. They came to support a man who stood by his principles, who respected his grandmother's wisdom, and who truly believed that ""one can't eat from a broken plate.""

His restaurant became more than just a place to eat; it became a symbol of unwavering values and respect for tradition, bringing a unique soul to the heart of Rome that could be felt in every corner of the city. His story served as a reminder that even in an ever-changing world, some things remain constant, and it is these constants that give our lives meaning.","138,60,225,263,50,218,185,17,153,61,265,285,294,82,203,38,313,81,191,20,253,315,30,255,200,96,207,319,214,212,131,209,205,145,284,233,64,166,317,58,122,150,84,259,208,288,219,63,1,324,336,125,314,76,135,216,228,92,141,139,171,186,158,6,10,65,75,33,57,35,80,12,197,39,113,222,246,169,53,187,213,201,300,167,289,249,27,174,134,160,173,146,325,111,243,86,44,123,177,329,52,85,23,303,198,235,296,88,34,306,290,118,28,257,43,312,69,163,155,322,116,132,215,190,230,335,238,40,252,93,55,94,206,100,32,234,87,56,305,334,217,89,162,196,266,269,115,37,331,224,159,247,262,124,15,54,49,221,271,175,194,189,195,320,99,328,83,193,165,286,183,90,97,292,101,22,21,26,301,227,29,154,237,323,226,242,106,142,298,140,71,130,260,339,4,13,210,78,279,287","35,12,170,200,46,85,111","1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"In the heart of an expansive, sunlit laboratory, an unusual experiment was underway. A gigantic beaker, filled to its brim with clear water, stood towering on an elevated platform. Beside it, a smaller beaker perched on a lower level. Between them, a fragile-looking narrow pipe curved in a smooth arc, connecting the two. The water, like lifeblood, was flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one.

Dr. Ames, the lead scientist of this operation, adjusted his glasses and stared at the ongoing process. He was conducting a significant experiment and the results were crucial. The room was filled with an eerie silence, the only sound was of the gentle gurgle of water coursing through the slender pipe.

Dropping down from the large beaker, the liquid began its journey with a sudden rush, eager to reach its destination. A plethora of minute bubbles trailed behind, making the clear water sparkle. Its path was not straight, but full of bends, much like the course of life. It swirled and danced around the curves of the pipe before slowing down towards the end of the journey.

Just below, the smaller beaker sat in anticipation, ready to embrace the inflowing water. It was not as grand or alluring as the large beaker, but it served its purpose with silent dignity. As the water touched its cold glass, a gentle ripple spread across its surface, disturbing the earlier calm.

Dr. Ames watched keenly as the level of water in the smaller beaker began to rise steadily. He noted down the readings, eyes gleaming with focus. Each drop that fell into the beaker carried the weight of the scientist's aspirations and hopes. The pressure was mounting not only in the pipe but also in Dr. Ames's heart.

A few more moments and the large beaker was now only half-filled. The water flowed incessantly, continuously transferring from the larger to the smaller one. The scene was somehow peaceful, offering solace in the simplicity of a natural process happening in the midst of a high-tech laboratory.

The level of water in the smaller beaker was approaching its brim. Ames held his breath as he watched the final drops slip through the pipe. And then, it was complete. The water had successfully flowed from the large beaker to the smaller one.

Ames sighed in relief, a sense of accomplishment washing over him. His experiment had been successful. The water flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe was not a mere spectacle of nature, but a symbol of perseverance and determination for Dr. Ames in his quest for scientific discovery.","339,23,85,217,270,35,329,242,326,325,214,172,222,33,40,302,177,295,109,208,262,161,236,328,140,268,186,9,53,46,17,207,64,28,89,204,29,238,193,56,230,3,174,327,307,171,108,73,68,148,255,42,101,118,116,74,322,196,137,25,164,63,10,233,86,112,265,173,0,271,170,294,296,5,246,160,113,212,105,317,324,247,93,303,4,49,39,338,54,323,195,250,146,24,231,191,133,224,298,90,88,190,136,120,309,235,241,106,100,251,99,41,12,87,154,197,158,301,1,162,192,334,336,139,67,248,187,229,312,175,216,159,264,276,94,260,156,144,272,157,51,254,43,281,293,218,36,125,213,221,199,286,130,205,237,151,306,62,202,313,337,155,60,318,215,165,96,314,320,107,274,121,194,300,14,206,180,310,225,275,21,134,18,65,122,297,37,285,117,30,69,152,263,188,167,181,27,166,78,45","145,72,18,73,186","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"The Great Lakes are a marvel of nature, five interconnected bodies of fresh water that span the United States and Canada. Among these are two particular lakes that stand out, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. They are not the largest of the Great Lakes, nor are they the smallest. They are, however, connected in a rather unique way. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario, a process that happens via the Niagara River.

This draining is not an event that one can observe overnight. Rather, it's a fascinating geological and geographical process that has been ongoing for thousands of years. It begins in the west, with the waters of Lake Erie. These waters start their journey with a slow movement, a subtle eastward slide prompted by the gentle gradient of the lake's floor.

As the waters near the eastern edge of Lake Erie, they begin to sense a change. The lake narrows into a river - the Niagara River. This is the key passage through which Lake Erie feeds its waters into Lake Ontario. The transformation from lake to river is gradual, with the waters slowly but surely funneling into this more narrow path.

The journey through the Niagara River is not without its highlights. The river itself has an impressive length, reaching 56 kilometers from end to end. Yet, about halfway through its course, the waters find an unexpected hurdle: the Niagara Falls. The iconic waterfall, a thunderous cascade that attracts millions of tourists every year, is actually a part of this lake-to-lake draining process.

The waters of Lake Erie plunge down the falls with an unbelievable ferocity, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle. They then continue their journey through the lower Niagara River, a journey that eventually ends at Lake Ontario. The river finally expands once again into a lake, where the water can spread out and regain its tranquility after the tumult of the falls.

With each passing second, this amazing process continues. Every drop of water that drains from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario does so via the Niagara River. And the cycle repeats itself, endlessly, constantly, with the unwavering rhythm of nature. 

Such is the marvel of these interconnected bodies of water. The draining of Lake Erie into Lake Ontario isn’t just a geographical fact. It’s a dance of waters, a tour de force of nature, a connection that speaks of the Earth’s amazing ability to shape and reshape itself, even when the changes are so subtle that they may not be noticed by an everyday observer. 

From Lake Erie, down the Niagara River, to Lake Ontario; this is more than a simple flow of water. It's an expression of our planet's natural complexity, beauty and interconnectedness. It's a testament to nature's power, and a symbol of the majesty of the Great Lakes region.","107,229,265,240,284,157,136,222,287,233,185,335,294,119,216,297,118,9,337,336,43,138,143,122,186,339,299,272,191,57,101,190,316,95,290,46,84,158,266,194,220,179,148,219,175,62,4,193,55,270,121,110,130,288,252,81,8,228,167,21,259,34,23,278,56,255,254,39,244,47,24,181,91,117,221,289,160,180,151,6,82,327,152,325,129,13,108,286,318,53,61,301,78,276,267,63,35,70,319,206,303,140,208,161,199,209,172,86,96,235,246,217,120,296,132,332,79,277,38,49,44,155,115,326,170,36,109,214,243,149,146,131,18,3,273,25,80,269,59,45,147,1,104,174,153,302,292,311,168,93,133,215,188,195,205,236,275,171,20,164,281,72,308,15,262,126,94,50,68,111,212,100,10,323,71,227,241,322,245,334,64,75,218,97,280,230,268,103,234,5,333,0,145,66,40,27,42,26,137,295","147,13,200,114,16","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
294,The parent tries to instill bits of knowledge in their child by simple communication.,"Marie, a proud and loving parent, always aimed to instill bits of knowledge in her young son, Peter, using the simple tool of communication. She believed in the power of the spoken word and that it would form the cornerstone of his education, beyond what he'd learn in school. Her dreams for her son were vast, filled with opportunities she herself hadn't had.

Each night, as she tucked him into bed, she'd share a new piece of information with him. Some nights, it would be a fascinating fact about a distant galaxy; on others, a captivating tale about an historical figure. She would watch as Peter's curious, sparkling blue eyes widened in awe, absorbing every word she spoke.

One day, during their bedtime routine, she told Peter about Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. She explained it in the simplest of terms, weaving a story out of equations and scientific concepts. Peter listened with undivided attention, his mother's voice lulling him into a world filled with boundless possibilities.

There were also days when she told him about their ancestors, about their struggles and victories. She shared the values they held dear, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and love. These stories filled Peter with a sense of pride in his heritage, an understanding of where he came from, and a vision of who he could become.

Marie didn't limit these teachings to bedtime alone. During their meals, she would talk to him about the nutritional value of their food. On their drives to school, she'd discuss the workings of the car engine or the importance of road signs. No moment was wasted; every interaction was a learning opportunity.

As they tended their backyard garden, Marie explained to Peter about photosynthesis, pollination, and the life cycle of plants. When it rained, she would tell him about the water cycle and how each droplet played a part in the grand scheme of life. In winter, they’d talk about snowflakes and their unique patterns. Each time, Peter's fascination deepened, his thirst for knowledge seemingly unquenchable.

One memorable day, they had an in-depth conversation about kindness and empathy. Marie used examples from their daily lives, detailing scenarios where these traits would be beneficial. This discussion had a profound impact on Peter, shaping his young mind into one that valued compassion over competition.

Marie was aware that not all lessons could be taught through words. So, she led by example, embodying the virtues she wished to impart. From watching his mother, Peter learned about patience, resilience, and the power of positivity.

Years later, Peter would attribute much of his worldly knowledge and moral compass to his mother's simple yet effective way of teaching.

295,"Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.","In a small, quaint kitchen of a cottage house, sat an aged yet powerful stove. Warmth emanated from the cracks of this ancient appliance, filling the room with cozy comfort. Seated on a nearby counter was a bar of smooth, velvety chocolate, unwrapped and basking in the stove's radiating heat. The morning had been chilly and the elderly homeowner, Mrs. Harper, had decided to use the stove for both heating and cooking.

Little by little, the stove's radiating heat began to work on the chocolate bar. The solid shape started to surrender to the encroaching warmth. Its stiff form softened gradually, the corners losing their sharpness first. Its color deepened, going from a pleasant brown to a dark, rich hue. The once smooth, mirror-like surface became rippled and uneven, waves of heat visibly altering it.

Unaware of the transformation underway, Mrs. Harper busied herself with her morning chores. The delicious aroma of melting chocolate quietly filling the kitchen remained unnoticed. She hummed an old tune, her mind lingering on days long gone. Occasionally, she stoked the fire, inadvertently fueling the stove's heat.

Meanwhile, the chocolate bar continued its slow melt. Its edges began to drip, falling onto the worn countertop. It pooled in the small crevices, creating a picturesque, delicious mess. The once-solid bar was now almost liquid, its form barely recognizable. But the scent was unmistakable - a rich, deep cocoa that was both sweet and slightly bitter.

Mrs. Harper returned to the kitchen, her nose finally picking up the distinct aroma. Her eyes widened with a mixture of surprise and delight. The sight of the almost completely melted chocolate bar greeted her. Her face broke into a gentle smile. She was reminded of her childhood when she and her brother would secretly melt chocolate to make candies.

Shaking her head with laughter, she turned off the stove, reducing the radiating heat. Carefully, she scooped up the melted chocolate, ensuring not to waste any of it. She decided to use it to make her famous chocolate pudding. By evening, her small home was filled with the nostalgic scent of her childhood favorite.

So, the little stove's radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby. It became an unintended, but welcomed, flavor of the day. And the old stove and Mrs. Harper once again managed to create magic together, turning a simple mistake into a day filled with sweet memories.","139,255,89,337,212,225,257,115,294,311,266,166,103,66,261,207,325,322,272,194,118,86,129,240,58,4,236,232,164,91,70,298,204,26,112,222,302,182,280,79,157,336,61,113,109,264,289,200,107,297,196,165,268,30,123,208,178,307,60,127,202,321,193,238,22,189,188,338,210,160,38,97,105,65,339,117,300,93,34,265,187,250,271,273,145,124,181,288,183,235,263,20,198,44,197,53,281,169,23,154,176,186,243,24,248,69,17,227,320,146,54,37,13,0,163,87,314,275,11,8,180,16,120,46,256,71,67,173,292,6,27,111,51,28,174,12,83,251,63,278,296,282,133,121,95,72,43,254,213,175,231,75,143,68,77,293,172,141,318,35,170,203,52,230,234,40,258,199,253,81,5,306,102,328,42,155,137,324,119,18,305,309,217,25,108,98,161,215,214,21,41,14,301,114,244,287,184,3,29,304","129,156,9,141,50","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
296,Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.,"In the small, eastern state of Vidalia, many of its essential resources were funded from the state budget. Part of this state budget came from the federal government's contentious spending package. The spending package was a source of national debate, causing a great rift between political parties. The disagreement was due to the allocations set out in the package and their long-term implications on the national debt.

Governor Bill Harrison, a seasoned politician, was quite aware of the controversy surrounding the federal spending package. Despite the uproar, he knew that much of the money his state used for infrastructure, education, healthcare, and environmental protection hinged on these funds. Vidalia had suffered from economic setbacks and needed every dollar it could get to support its citizens.

On a frosty Tuesday morning, Governor Harrison held a press conference. Journalists from various publications and news outlets filled the state capitol's media room. He addressed the crowd, trying to provide reassurances about the state's financial health amid the national dispute.

He explained, ""The federal government's spending package, contentious as it may be, plays a vital role in our state's budget. These funds enable us to improve our schools, hospitals, and roads.""

However, not everyone in Vidalia agreed with the governor's approach. Among the dissenters was State Senator Emily Greene. She was particularly worried about the future, concerned that reliance on such a contentious source might eventually dry up or lead to troubling political implications for the state. Her concern was shared by many of her constituents, resulting in substantial public pressure on the governor's office.

Nevertheless, Governor Harrison had a plan. His strategy was to use the funds from the contentious spending package to boost the state's economic outlook. He proposed investing in education and local businesses to create a sustainable economic climate that wouldn't always need to rely on federal funding. 

The governor's plan was met with resistance by Senator Greene and her allies. They contested that such a move would only cause further debt without assured returns. The debate grew fierce, echoing the disagreements on the national level.

Meanwhile, the citizens of Vidalia watched as their leaders clashed over their state's future. Many were just concerned about immediate needs, like good schools for their children and a stable healthcare system. The contentious spending package, while causing political uproar, was critical to meeting these needs.

In the end, Governor Harrison proceeded with his plan, using the federal funding. The results would only be seen in time. And until then, Vidalia remained in the national spotlight, a microcosm of the larger issues around federal government spending.

297,My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.,"Every morning at 8:00 sharp, as if dictated by an invisible clock, I found myself standing in line at the nearby coffee shop. I was a creature of routine, but above all, I was a caffeine addict. The aromatic scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, instantly brightening my mornings and setting the tone for the rest of the day.

I'd wake up, bleary-eyed and dreary, yearning for the taste of that luxurious espresso. I couldn't resist the call of the caramel macchiato with an extra shot of espresso, nor the enticing frothiness of a cappuccino on a cold, misty morning. The siren's call of caffeine was always too strong.

Each cup was a small expense, but the daily cost accumulated quickly. My morning routine started to carve a significant hole in my wallet. My tiny daily coffee expenses were draining up all my income.

Days turned into weeks, weeks into months. Every month when I looked at my bank statement, it was the same story - a significant chunk of my income was consumed by my coffee habit. My friends began to joke about my caffeine addiction, making light of my predicament. But for me, it was no laughing matter.

The delicious taste of brewed coffee had turned bitter with guilt. The once soothing warmth of the cup felt like a glaring symbol of my irresponsible spending habits. Realizing the gravity of the situation, I resolved to make a change.

I started by skipping my daily trip to the coffee shop on Saturdays. Instead, I began brewing my own coffee at home, with a simple French press. I’d learned that it wasn’t quite the same as the fancy drinks I was used to, but it was a small sacrifice I was willing to make.

Gradually, my trips to the coffee shop lessened, from daily visits to only once or twice a week. My bank account began to show the effects, too, slowly but surely. I had more money for other necessities and even started saving up a bit.

Despite the obvious progress, it was a bitter pill to swallow. I missed my daily routine and the allure of the cafe. I missed the friendly baristas and the comforting smell of roasted beans that greeted me every morning. 

But over time, I came to appreciate the subtlety of my home-brewed coffee. The homemade aroma began to replace the absence of the coffee shop ambiance. My morning routine evolved from a luxurious indulgence to a mindful, homemade ritual.

The experience taught me that small expenses indeed add up over time. My tiny daily coffee expenses were draining up all my income, but I successfully kicked the habit. Now, every sip of my home-brewed coffee is a reminder of a hard-earned financial lesson, and a small victory over my excessive spending.","215,214,86,8,293,101,106,146,273,331,39,276,64,51,40,270,140,300,247,173,182,155,194,277,260,44,256,166,54,23,3,112,266,316,171,271,129,161,202,261,89,318,136,85,10,134,75,77,147,27,209,191,184,145,217,251,268,135,304,332,50,61,12,70,238,306,159,14,172,235,216,219,269,180,222,207,49,94,24,244,95,286,21,109,120,336,212,69,187,193,313,265,55,62,330,90,97,84,321,149,151,294,31,178,160,308,199,16,52,307,208,79,123,157,317,296,299,46,231,257,127,292,88,205,282,156,93,233,20,18,245,128,248,114,295,323,142,15,65,122,81,239,119,144,71,181,66,26,130,312,110,259,287,163,328,131,34,200,162,1,13,192,262,170,186,73,25,339,298,43,148,243,234,249,113,153,302,57,42,121,189,334,99,188,267,289,211,174,102,19,224,28,138,118,103,246,327,58,87,325","122,5,102,135,116","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
298,The father told the son that it was his way or the highway when the son came back home drunk.,"Once upon a time, in a small town lived a middle-aged man named Tom. Tom was a strict yet caring father to his only son, Jack. The two shared a relationship that was both tense and loving, but it had recently become strained. The issues started when Jack began indulging in late-night parties and started coming home drunk.

One evening, Jack staggered through the front door, a clear sign of intoxication. The usually quiet house was disrupted by Jack's loud and messy entrance. He clumsily dropped his keys, sending them clattering onto the tiled floor. This noise woke Tom, who had been sleeping lightly in the adjacent room.

Rising from his bed, Tom went out to confront his son. His heart ached at the sight of Jack, his boy, whose eyes were glazed and speech slurred. He remembered the innocent kid who once played around the house, always full of energy and life. The change was disheartening.

Taking a deep breath, Tom reached out to steady his son, his voice ringing clear in the silent night, ""Jack, we need to talk."" Jack merely mumbled, struggling to stand straight. It was clear to Tom that his son was not in a state to have a discussion.

Frustrated yet patient, Tom helped his son up to his room and put him to bed. He decided to wait till morning to have the talk. The next day, as the sun peeked through the curtains, Tom found himself sitting on the edge of Jack's bed. He looked at his son, who was still fast asleep, with concern.

Deciding it was time, Tom woke Jack up. A groan escaped Jack's lips, his hangover was evident. ""Son,"" Tom started, his voice laced with concern and sternness, ""We need to talk about last night.""

Tom described how he felt when he saw his son drunk, how it worried him to no end. He emphasized his concerns about Jack's health and future. He reminded Jack of his ambitions, his dreams, and how his present lifestyle was endangering them.

As his father spoke, Jack listened quietly, an expression of regret on his face. He saw the love and concern in his father's eyes. ""I'm worried about you, Jack,"" Tom confessed, ""Your behavior is unacceptable.""

After a long pause, Tom finally made his ultimatum. He gave Jack a choice - it was either to amend his ways or leave the house. His words echoed around the room, ""It's either my way or the highway.""

The silence hung heavily as Jack absorbed his father's words. He looked at Tom, understanding the gravity of the situation. He nodded, vowing to change his ways. This was the turning point in their relationship, where a son learned to value his father's wisdom and a father saw his son stepping towards maturity.

The events of that day changed Jack. The ultimatum served its purpose, and Jack took it to heart. He realised the consequences of his actions and started making amends. Tom's tough love showed Jack the right path, a path away from drunken escapades and towards a prosperous future.","211,42,65,11,197,321,320,41,21,271,232,290,185,127,313,40,237,18,4,138,200,1,124,116,166,152,38,35,52,177,170,43,287,87,53,62,128,181,46,90,273,5,295,263,192,277,302,55,300,113,132,94,221,304,224,267,203,262,186,56,319,187,196,180,19,0,15,220,148,34,324,239,14,139,147,86,182,257,248,110,33,45,39,120,269,137,104,165,106,50,17,190,111,199,193,169,105,315,64,275,59,99,327,154,213,312,318,188,322,13,176,276,126,233,308,249,156,264,93,121,73,219,323,278,314,103,143,326,335,117,259,306,118,158,114,299,325,29,79,22,285,284,44,195,305,133,270,228,122,81,317,141,241,328,301,51,174,252,27,123,136,238,293,191,135,171,23,61,92,296,212,119,28,144,102,2,149,173,69,31,58,236,250,150,25,74,88,63,207,338,6,243,244,303,283,194,258,57,332,49","136,49,155,47,194","1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 160, 163, 166, 169, 172, 175, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193, 196, 199"
299,The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go.,"Once a thriving business filled with laughter and light, the software company of CyberLink now bore an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty. The management had recently conducted a large meeting in which they announced that significant changes were imminent. They claimed that the company had to adapt to the fluctuating market or risk being left behind.

The executive team made it abundantly clear to the employees - be on board with the new policies or find themselves without a job. Fear swept through the ranks as they all mentally processed this ultimatum. Anxiety bubbled, whispers filled the hallways, and a sense of doom set in. 

""Is this even legal?"" Angela, a veteran coder in the company, asked her peers. She had been with CyberLink for ten years now and had seen it all - the ups, the downs, the transformations. But this, she admitted, was an entirely different level.

Her colleagues shrugged, equally baffled. Sarah, the junior programmer, tried to reassure the others. ""Maybe the policies won't be so bad,"" she said, although she didn't look convinced.

The very next day, management rolled out the new policies. The set of rules included extended working hours, elimination of flexible working, and a decrease in health and retirement benefits. It was clear to everyone that the policies were designed to cut costs at the expense of the employees' well-being.

The once friendly and cooperative environment began to crack. Workers showed signs of stress, productivity dropped, and for the first time, the chatter in the cafeteria died down. Some employees considered leaving, but they feared the job market's unpredictability. Others decided to brave it out, hoping the situation would eventually improve.

But Angela was neither the type to cower nor the type to silently endure. She rallied her colleagues, instilling in them the courage to push back. The management had a responsibility towards the employees, she argued. They couldn't be allowed to exploit their power while the workers suffered.

Much to the management's surprise, the employees united, demanding a reconsideration of the new policies. There were strained meetings, heated discussions, and sleepless nights. But the employees held their ground, steadfastly refusing to accept policies that they believed were unfair.

Eventually, the management realized that their employees weren't just replaceable cogs in a machine. Their skills, commitment, and passion were instrumental to the company's success. They had to treat them as people, not assets. 

After countless debates and negotiations, the management finally conceded. They retracted their stringent policies and introduced ones that respected the employees' needs. The sigh of relief reverberated through the building as CyberLink found a way to evolve, without losing its soul or its people.","245,163,263,290,210,238,182,217,103,300,288,76,321,265,125,167,83,42,272,314,309,158,191,134,313,22,74,172,40,23,6,32,218,115,216,231,320,131,200,283,324,250,328,41,101,38,214,137,55,278,147,39,116,335,333,276,123,14,242,170,65,129,117,201,166,253,275,338,160,154,141,58,59,279,62,77,89,271,61,106,303,139,126,130,294,36,311,10,142,268,92,46,44,225,111,199,155,63,20,322,189,264,304,0,153,204,53,31,71,301,331,127,259,57,133,190,104,185,220,162,73,187,267,193,70,35,178,284,122,317,329,339,287,254,171,179,334,34,112,13,50,228,212,296,241,302,229,144,138,257,88,291,234,180,69,285,318,148,298,81,30,173,79,75,19,4,60,237,98,143,18,306,87,54,307,7,66,91,99,164,219,266,260,258,262,17,247,297,85,168,110,97,310,240,236,9,211,84,222,206","159,10,110,146,81","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
300,"The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.","Carol had long prided herself on running a tight ship when it came to her household. Her family knew her standards and her children, Isabella and Christopher, had learned to respect the boundaries she had set. Her husband, Robert, on the other hand, seemed to consistently push back on one issue: dinner. 

As a successful lawyer, Robert was always on the go, treating meals as a necessary interruption to his busy schedule. He would often return from work complaining about the meals Carol had prepared. Whether it was too much salt, too little sauce, or simply not to his preference, Robert always had a critique ready.

One evening, Carol decided to put her foot down. Having spent hours in the kitchen preparing a wholesome lasagna meal for her family, she was determined not to let her efforts go to waste. She knew it wasn't Robert's favorite, but he couldn't always have steak every night.

Robert came home late, just as the children were finishing their meal. ""What are we having tonight?"" he asked nonchalantly. Carol served him a generous portion of the lasagna and waited, the tension in the air almost palpable.

""This isn't steak,"" Robert announced, after examining the meal. A sour expression crept onto his face and Carol knew it was coming; another complaint about her cooking.

""Well,"" Carol said, her voice steady, ""Since I am in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what I make or go hungry.""

Robert looked at her, eyes wide with surprise. No one else in the room made a sound. Even Isabella and Christopher, not used to their mother speaking in such a stern tone, looked at each other in astonishment.

Carol continued, ""I put my time and effort into making our meals. This isn't a restaurant where you can order whatever you want. This is a family dinner and you will eat what I serve or you'll go without.""

Robert's surprise turned into amusement. It seemed he was unused to such assertiveness from his wife. He looked at the lasagna, then back at Carol. ""Alright,"" he said, raising his hands in defeat. ""You're right. I'm sorry for taking your efforts for granted.""

That night, Robert had lasagna for dinner. It wasn't steak, but he savored every bite, appreciating the love and effort Carol had poured into it. It was a small victory for Carol, but the precedent was set. From then on, there were no complaints about dinner in the house. Robert learned to appreciate his wife's cooking, and everyone ate in harmony.","6,313,111,52,119,58,249,275,90,221,245,107,75,138,32,150,220,146,261,187,160,60,185,242,206,47,162,210,76,41,34,118,302,184,205,223,157,287,326,108,17,122,120,229,55,24,323,257,5,303,186,250,226,295,113,127,315,0,18,143,330,83,272,131,251,77,325,332,268,4,44,16,224,280,253,96,262,8,93,333,20,56,74,39,217,81,282,180,235,92,192,207,147,25,154,133,304,123,194,73,201,2,99,21,273,156,231,230,54,228,112,62,283,114,288,167,36,137,61,71,237,317,327,197,182,148,40,200,89,135,331,163,259,91,284,328,102,129,128,69,320,297,144,49,239,274,67,173,136,53,14,312,11,193,95,26,115,12,209,66,299,158,169,59,248,1,198,190,28,301,142,260,15,263,322,68,103,286,87,188,306,100,130,79,13,38,255,314,298,125,165,311,279,269,335,170,265,57,29,174","189,161,170,33,50","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
301,The technical lead informed the team that they have to follow his ideas for the project to be completed without question or risk failure.,"The sun was setting as the weary team shuffled into the conference room, bringing with them the echoes of their keyboard clatters. Their faces bore the grim look of a long day as their team lead, John, walked in. His face carried the stern, unyielding expression he was known for when the stakes were high. He put down his laptop and motioned for everyone to gather.

""The project we are working on is a high priority,"" he started, his voice echoing in the hushed room. ""I have been thinking hard on how to approach it. I believe I have devised a plan that will maximize efficiency and lead us to success.""

The team leaned in, eager to learn what this new strategy entailed. Some hoped it would make their lives easier, while others doubted any plan could simplify such a complex task. 

""From tomorrow,"" John continued, ""we will follow a new strategy. The project will be broken down into smaller components and each component will have a specific owner.""

Everyone stared at him, anxiety knotted in their stomachs. Questions started to churn in their minds. Some wondered about the feasibility of his plan, others about its effectiveness. However, everyone silently agreed that his plan could potentially change everything.

John, perceiving their thoughts, added, ""You will have to follow my ideas for the project to be completed without question or risk failure.""

A murmur passed through the room. They knew that John was an experienced lead, but his words set a daunting precedent. The team members began to worry about the consequences of failing to meet his expectations.

Over the next several weeks, the team worked tirelessly on the project, following John’s plan meticulously. Initially, the strategy seemed flawless, with every team member focused on their assigned component. But as the weeks passed, doubts started creeping in. 

They noticed the pressure building as the project neared its deadline. There were mishaps, misunderstandings, and unforeseen problems, all because the team was following John's ideas blindly. Still, they held on, trusting in their leader’s experience and expertise.

Yet, failure was around the corner. The project was not completed by the deadline, causing distress among the team. John, carrying the weight of his words and the failure of his team, fell into introspection.

However, they all learned a crucial lesson from the experience. While it's essential to have faith in their leaders, they realized, questioning and refining ideas is what leads to a truly successful project. They understood that no idea, however grand, should be followed blindly without question or evaluation.

John, too, understood his mistake. He recognized that he had set an unrealistic expectation by asking his team to follow his ideas without question. From then on, he encouraged open dialogue and active participation from all team members, leading to a more dynamic and successful working environment.","68,324,320,285,282,79,8,13,42,152,215,205,75,61,94,288,158,297,293,60,266,313,3,38,212,176,300,144,191,64,261,216,233,133,334,104,250,304,100,247,225,229,264,151,91,130,223,245,171,70,271,19,116,272,327,143,181,194,26,330,287,170,251,114,277,237,192,258,221,56,51,37,129,6,182,289,260,115,255,83,74,44,93,188,230,33,146,246,139,295,53,174,308,167,78,159,208,178,49,186,164,279,81,73,71,128,172,259,177,168,29,238,256,18,228,106,338,123,50,149,137,163,92,7,80,227,234,333,236,36,150,254,280,218,314,85,140,187,88,134,5,14,4,62,337,299,108,0,220,242,57,268,303,66,335,284,103,98,332,15,27,292,138,175,239,201,316,69,147,25,142,298,319,28,145,267,160,43,243,119,275,41,231,232,219,198,302,309,12,118,1,166,55,63,193,125,21,11,315,67","172,146,27,187,153","1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 160, 163, 166, 169, 172, 175, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193, 196, 199"
302,I told my wife I will compromise on most of the things but on holidays I can do whatever I want.,"I've always been someone who believes in the power of compromise, especially in a marriage. For years, my wife, Jane, and I have navigated through our life together by engaging in a balanced give-and-take. I've changed my opinion on home decor, traded my favorite sports car for a family-friendly van, and even adjusted my dietary preferences to accommodate hers. I've willingly made these sacrifices out of love, believing in the importance of compromise in the journey of life together. But there was one domain in which I steadfastly stood my ground: holidays.

It was on a brisk fall morning when I first broached the subject to Jane. With the annual leave period looming around the corner, I sipped my hot coffee and told her about my plans. ""Honey,"" I began, my gaze fixed on her surprised expression, ""I've decided on what we're going to do for the holiday this year.""

She raised her eyebrows, expectantly waiting for me to continue. I took a deep breath, preparing to tell her something she might not want to hear. ""I've been thinking about this a lot. I know we usually compromise on most things. But on holidays, I really feel like I should be able to do what I want.""

A moment of silence enveloped us. But I plowed on, sharing my thoughts. ""You see, throughout the year, I bend a lot of my preferences to make our everyday life work smoothly. That's fine, and I don't mind it. But when it comes to holidays, I'd like it to be the time for me to recharge and indulge in my own interests.""

I explained that my idea was not about having a holiday alone, but rather about planning our trips to locations I preferred or pursuing activities I enjoyed. My intention was not to exclude her or deprive her of the decision-making process. 

""I've always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, or try deep-sea fishing, or even just go on a road trip to wherever the road takes us,"" I confessed. ""And I think it's important for us to have some time when we can really do what makes us happy.""

Jane listened attentively, her face a blend of surprise and contemplation. Once I finished speaking, she gently touched my hand. ""I understand,"" she said, ""I didn't realize that you felt this strongly about holidays.""

There was a pause before she continued. ""I appreciate your honesty, and I agree. I think it's a good idea to have some time when we can follow our own interests. Let's make this work.""

We spent the rest of that morning discussing our holiday plans. There were several moments of laughter, a couple of disagreements, but in the end, we created a plan that honored both our interests. Thus, began our new holiday tradition. 

From then on, our holiday plans carried a special sentiment. While they still included compromise, I was finally able to make decisions I desired. And surprisingly, Jane found joy in my choices too. Life, as they say, is about balance. And in our case, a little compromise made our world turn just right.","323,223,339,0,114,159,256,88,245,32,156,329,35,273,189,195,152,158,237,303,99,52,264,247,316,11,65,125,269,118,70,138,219,38,83,43,332,109,120,227,108,306,69,123,79,42,327,107,111,226,249,299,12,255,275,229,246,87,16,284,238,121,187,17,300,236,205,170,210,239,40,260,305,184,208,188,281,262,113,242,222,13,57,94,22,103,335,274,197,81,60,143,322,290,248,292,319,268,46,228,181,308,86,325,149,272,8,293,225,147,301,203,297,160,58,183,116,280,85,285,162,257,51,54,82,179,97,53,310,180,102,276,74,155,283,129,124,215,287,221,220,263,130,36,171,98,139,19,196,214,314,20,289,105,234,128,243,176,49,31,93,324,326,240,258,45,135,80,172,204,211,217,207,267,175,30,63,190,216,64,206,127,62,296,252,337,131,163,101,26,164,136,146,318,317,141,336,7,298,21","199,52,65,111,20","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
303,"If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit.","In the industrial heartland of the city, there stood a large factory. It was a towering building, bristling with smokestacks and lined with windows that stared out like hundreds of eyes. The workers arrived every morning, ready to put in their hours and earn their living. Their boss, a stern man named Mr. Cruickshank, ran the factory with an iron fist. 

The factory had a reputation for being one of the hardest places to work in the city. Mr. Cruickshank had set a rule: each worker was required to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. This was a demand that many found hard to meet. The work was grueling, the hours long, and the pay not commensurate with the effort they put in.

One day, during a morning assembly, a tired worker named Joe raised his hand. ""Mr. Cruickshank,"" he began, his voice ringing out clear over the sounds of the factory, ""not all of us can keep up with the 20 hours. Some of us have families. We have other jobs. Twenty hours is too much.""

Mr. Cruickshank stared down at him from his elevated platform. His face was hard and impassive. ""If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week,"" he finally announced, ""they can quit.""

The assembly room was filled with a stunned silence. Workers glanced at each other, shock and fear in their eyes. Quitting meant losing their jobs, but continuing meant being stuck in an impossible situation. 

Joe was taken aback, but he straightened his shoulders and nodded. He knew he couldn’t continue at this pace. He quit his job that day, followed by a handful of others. These were hardworking people, eager to earn their living but not at the cost of their health and families.

Word of Mr. Cruickshank's ultimatum spread through the city. The factory became even more notorious, and finding replacement workers became tough. The productivity of the factory started to dwindle, orders were not met on time, and the reputation of the factory continued to plummet. 

Meanwhile, Joe and the workers who quit started looking for other jobs. They found work in smaller, more lenient workshops where their skills were appreciated, and they were treated with respect.

As the factory's downfall became apparent, Mr. Cruickshank's stern exterior started to crack. He realized the mistake he had made. He hadn't valued his workers enough to understand their struggles, and in his arrogance, he had lost their loyalty.

The lesson was clear: every worker deserved respect and understanding, something that Mr. Cruickshank had ignored. It wasn't enough just to demand work from them; treating them with dignity was just as important. And when the workers were treated right, they gave their best. This lesson was learned at a high price, but it was a lesson that Mr. Cruickshank would not forget.","66,211,299,114,171,75,100,273,140,121,177,18,130,95,239,233,110,135,53,129,169,54,25,287,146,5,131,109,0,74,46,318,16,28,202,76,71,199,291,200,141,170,183,284,77,85,204,290,139,302,70,13,43,249,9,86,254,240,59,319,40,238,193,3,246,160,203,173,218,280,119,104,282,98,126,288,156,309,251,213,82,172,15,335,322,73,293,225,223,222,182,90,259,264,108,197,148,229,268,116,247,221,195,102,69,21,257,7,105,24,30,196,267,50,97,103,217,45,276,138,10,115,168,128,205,283,49,300,11,12,41,14,235,244,174,31,181,8,1,118,315,262,72,281,237,236,159,209,285,152,180,154,158,92,120,145,296,27,289,339,167,38,269,214,232,137,147,295,163,34,175,298,258,212,210,301,272,253,338,93,220,29,22,79,127,275,230,125,330,192,278,277,308,55,62,122,250,310,261,241","172,3,128,176,50","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11"
304,"Every evening, many drinkers get together in a bar near our home. You know, birds of a feather flock together.","Every evening, as the sun gracefully says goodbye to the daytime skies, a fascinating gathering takes place in a local bar close to our home. This place, The Last Mug, is a magnet for people of all stripes. Yet, there is one specific group that captures my attention the most: the drinkers.

Members of this diverse assembly come together like long lost friends, embracing their shared love for life and liquor. I have often heard it said, ""birds of a feather flock together."" How perfectly this proverb illustrates the camaraderie among these good-hearted individuals!

I've observed the drinking crowd from my window, that overlooks the cozy little bar's entrance, long enough to know some of them by sight, if not by name. There's the towering lumberjack of a man, bristly bearded and dressed in plaid, who always orders a pint of the bitterest brew available. There's the petite, red-haired lady, with a twinkling laugh and sparkling eyes, who prefers the sweet comfort of a well-aged wine. And then there's the quiet, older gentleman in the corner, whose preference for neat whiskey is as reliable as his timeworn leather jacket.

Every evening, this motley crew strolls into the warmly lit bar, a routine as regular as the sun’s setting. One by one, they pull off their coats, settle into their familiar perches, and request their favourite drinks from Lucy, the barmaid who greets them with a knowing smile.

The Last Mug becomes a hub of chatter and camaraderie, filled with the clinking of glasses and jovial laughter echoing against the wooden walls. The air is saturated with stories, some tales of heroic feats, others lamentations of woeful woes, all amplified by the influence of alcohol. The common thread that binds them all is their shared solace in spirits.

As I watch from my window, I can't help but feel a sense of warmth from their cheer. They aren't just customers in a bar; they're a family, bound not by blood, but by their mutual respect and affection. They share their dreams and their failures without fear of judgment, finding strength in their solidarity.

""Birds of a feather flock together,"" I often whisper to myself as I observe the charming spectacle of companionship and revelry. It's a sight I've grown accustomed to and one that I look forward to witnessing every evening. It's not just a gathering of drinkers; it's a celebration of life, of shared experiences, of togetherness.

I've come to appreciate this special sight and the lesson it has taught me: that shared passions and common interests can forge bonds of friendship strong enough to stand the test of time. These drinkers may be flocking together because of their shared love for liquor, but what keeps them together is their deep-seated camaraderie. Watching them, I'm reminded of the incredible power of unity and shared experiences.

305,I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.,"As an enthusiastic learner, I have an intense passion for talking to people who are knowledgeable about computers. This special liking stems from my profound interest in learning about computers. My fascination with this field began as a young boy when my father gifted me a personal desktop for my 10th birthday. At first, I merely used it for playing games and browsing the internet. However, as the days passed, curiosity piqued, and I began to question how this magical machine worked.

At school, I befriended a group of students who seemed to know a lot about computers. They were always discussing the latest technological advancements, the most recent software updates, and the newest hardware. Joining conversations with them was thrilling; it was like peeling back the layers of a wonderfully complex mystery. I would constantly listen in, picking up terms like 'operating systems,' 'hardware', and 'software'. Despite not understanding everything, I was captivated by their discussions.

Seeking to understand more, I started researching independently. The more I learned, the more fascinated I became. I was intrigued by everything from the coding that went into software creation to the physical components that made up the computer hardware. But nothing compared to the real conversations I had with those computer experts. Hearing their explanations and seeing their passion were contagious and stoked the flames of my curiosity.

My passion made me want to spend more time with them. I would strike up conversations, ask them questions about computers, and listen to their answers. In the beginning, their answers went right over my head, but gradually, I began to understand. Their knowledge of computers was seemingly boundless, and their ability to communicate such complex ideas in a way I could grasp was utterly mesmerizing.

Through these conversations, my understanding about computers deepened. They taught me about binary code, the language of computers, and about various programming languages like Python and Java. They explained to me the difference between RAM and ROM and how a processor works. These interactions, coupled with my own research, made learning about computers feel like an adventure.

Every time I talked to these people, I learned something new. My appetite for knowledge about computers was being continuously satiated, yet my desire to learn more only grew stronger. Their passion, coupled with my own growing interest, kept driving me forward. I was not just learning about computers; I was learning to love learning. Their knowledge illuminated my path, spurring me on in my journey.

Now, I never miss an opportunity to engage with people who understand computers. Their insights are invaluable and irreplaceable, providing me with a wealth of knowledge that I continually apply to my personal studies. This is why I love to talk to people who know about computers; their passion and expertise help fuel my enjoyment in learning about computers.","281,323,230,212,252,88,201,183,140,320,20,8,132,123,286,41,156,104,314,195,45,138,84,304,103,94,192,311,260,250,82,57,146,264,276,134,154,318,335,80,81,236,117,259,96,15,141,272,289,19,168,4,330,66,27,162,302,288,71,309,164,133,296,98,115,172,299,36,139,72,238,144,135,193,182,171,256,316,203,13,187,148,270,12,65,315,32,61,126,331,329,245,86,294,228,199,210,17,95,233,221,6,9,68,114,92,100,70,54,83,50,23,298,226,91,239,165,237,110,77,159,5,257,128,125,273,58,108,37,21,216,34,206,301,51,209,278,87,16,120,284,283,185,157,99,59,327,234,267,173,285,149,24,2,124,232,112,127,269,243,282,137,31,1,116,169,339,249,220,33,324,241,109,55,313,105,223,274,303,107,64,75,265,308,266,73,190,307,152,306,194,160,130,247,10,113,3,332,29,28","24,190,188,184,60","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
306,"The fancy Michelin-star restaurant seems to attract a homogeneous clientele, who all appear to wear the same fashion and be around the same age.","The city was a melting pot of cultures and fashions, with people from all walks of life coalescing into a vibrant social ecosystem. Amidst this melting pot, the prestigious Michelin-star restaurant stood as a towering monument of culinary excellence, drawing in a specific type of clientele with its allure. This wasn't just any restaurant; it had a certain air of sophistication that set it apart from the rest. 

The restaurant, beautifully nestled on a chic avenue, was a magnet for a very homogeneous clientele. Day after day, the parking lot filled up with polished luxury cars, chauffeurs opening the doors for impeccably dressed men and women. It wasn't just the fashion that was striking, but also their similar age group. In a city of diverse people, it seemed peculiar that this restaurant catered almost exclusively to a select group who appeared to be cut from the same cloth.

These patrons all wore refined, elegant attires that were remarkably similar - tailored suits for men, tastefully posh dresses for women. They seemed to have a predilection for muted, sophisticated colors, steering away from gaudy prints or anything that would make them stand out. Their hairstyles, too, reflected a similar aesthetic - slicked back for men, expertly coiffed for women.

It wasn't just their sartorial choices that were harmonized; their age group was also strikingly alike. They all seemed to fall within a bracket of late forties to mid-fifties, with few outliers. It was as if the restaurant was an exclusive club, and the entry criteria were based on age, fashion, and possibly status.

When seated, these patrons would engage in hushed conversations, discussing, presumably, matters of shared interest - business, finance, politics, or fashion. It was a fascinating display of uniformity amidst diversity, revealing a slice of social stratification that remained hidden under the city's dynamic façade.

Even the staff seemed tailored to fit this unique clientele's taste. Waiters in crisp uniforms, sommeliers with an impeccable knowledge of wines, and chefs who were culinary virtuosos, all appeared to cater to the unspoken expectations of this homogeneous group.

The Michelin-star restaurant, with its extravagant chandeliers and expansive wine cellar, embodied a world far removed from the rest of the city's clamor. This was a world that offered a certain experience, an unspoken promise of exclusivity, attracting a clientele who not only reveled in such refinement but also reflected it in their fashion and age.

The city, a blending palette of people, continued its life around this Michelin-star restaurant. Unconcerned and unfazed, the restaurant stood as an enclave of homogeneity amidst the vibrant city's diversity, attracting its exclusive clientele like a lighthouse in a tumultuous sea.","114,261,167,221,41,64,15,155,212,183,165,2,13,239,168,210,298,336,84,271,180,184,259,201,37,211,243,109,14,74,126,310,65,316,245,134,54,162,279,293,339,63,69,53,181,141,231,329,252,133,144,61,149,197,233,228,320,192,237,108,227,40,107,101,275,75,213,129,208,81,143,83,174,26,327,225,226,24,283,238,335,78,205,122,86,153,50,284,29,119,3,59,307,93,49,235,22,334,248,44,305,157,202,137,277,315,251,255,194,106,230,267,25,136,104,19,87,262,314,32,249,290,39,146,163,72,216,328,90,0,209,57,196,158,224,18,70,98,66,186,285,7,200,34,303,52,94,28,219,21,27,333,115,68,254,304,121,56,294,250,9,35,296,100,193,135,287,289,288,96,43,124,266,46,105,207,17,278,189,111,295,58,308,127,309,130,190,102,229,38,234,151,292,169,123,139,148,91,269,71","156,101,93,183,185","1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150"
307,The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves.,"In the bustling city of New York, a prominent business seminar was taking place. The speakers' lineup was filled with some of the most influential thinkers in their respective fields. Among those in attendance were a group of lawyers, hailing from the city's most prestigious law firms. These lawyers had dedicated their time to attend this seminar, hoping to glean some insights into the evolving landscape of business law.

As the first speaker took the podium, the lawyers attentively listened, jotting down any relevant pieces of information. Each was highly specialized in their field, yet they all understood the significance of constantly broadening their knowledge. The first speaker, a renowned economist, began discussing recent economic trends that have been shaking the business world. 

As the economist spoke, the lawyers started to whisper amongst themselves. Some of them expressed their skepticism towards the speaker's forecasts. Others, however, thought that these predictions could potentially influence the way they would advise their clients.

As the day progressed, the whispers became a spirited conversation. Between presentations, the lawyers would huddle together in the opulent conference room, debating the topics that had been presented. Some argued about the potential impact of technology on business contracts, while others expressed concern about the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. 

While differing in their viewpoints, they all agreed on one thing. The business world was evolving at a rapid pace, and as legal professionals, it was imperative for them to stay abreast of these changes. They believed their responsibility extended beyond the walls of a courtroom. To offer proper guidance, they needed to understand the driving forces behind the business world.

By the end of the seminar, the lawyers were discussing animatedly amongst themselves. They conversed passionately, their faces lit up by the prospect of new legal challenges. It was clear they were not just attending this seminar for the sake of it; they were there to grow, to learn, and to challenge their understanding.

As the business seminar closed, the group of lawyers headed towards a nearby café. Their conversation continued over hot cups of coffee, discussing the day's events and dissecting the information presented. They were not just a group of lawyers; they were a think tank dedicated to understanding the dynamics of business. 

Their discussion did not simply end with the seminar. Instead, the lawyers took their newfound knowledge back to their law firms, ready to impart these insights to their teams. Each lawyer knew they had a responsibility to their clients to stay ahead of the curve.

The lawyers who attended the business seminar indeed talked amongst themselves, but they also listened, learned, and engaged with a world that extended far beyond the confines of their law offices. Their discussion was not just an echo in the conference room; it was a necessary step in their continual evolution as lawyers.","37,114,29,78,195,14,180,281,28,289,153,222,251,321,151,324,60,97,116,86,288,32,99,253,323,216,279,223,82,244,12,155,101,44,292,142,129,320,118,141,122,22,52,259,0,18,167,305,274,245,306,71,164,16,15,5,112,4,178,209,284,158,134,322,174,201,308,214,300,19,219,156,198,132,40,319,185,35,290,286,186,157,150,131,234,159,297,252,64,7,190,59,133,261,213,140,303,62,196,239,187,318,136,238,61,235,42,39,54,43,45,145,247,127,111,206,2,57,310,328,179,285,17,76,169,312,271,218,110,339,230,263,119,128,287,296,329,333,211,47,325,109,173,208,250,41,94,108,207,204,107,24,104,106,227,331,160,278,258,10,48,55,202,68,189,31,268,175,83,26,337,192,163,309,38,113,304,240,36,98,79,270,205,228,121,27,266,143,33,199,203,184,77,11,80,96,197,314,130,84","177,48,51,67,174","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
308,The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.,"The city's favorite sports organization, the Cardinal Soccer Club, has always been known for its unique approach. Unlike most other soccer clubs, the Cardinal has a distinctive characteristic - it is divided into groups of people from the same geographical regions. This division is an initiative that the management took to promote team synergy and improve communication within the team.

Each group consists of players originating from the same region. For instance, the British, Latin American, African, and Asian players each have their distinct groups. The idea behind this arrangement is that the shared regional background could foster camaraderie, understanding, and a sense of home amongst the group members.

Everyone in the club practices the art of soccer quite often. It is a common sight to see the fields bustling with activities, with players running around and sweating it out under the guidance of their respective coaches. The common drive amongst them is to improve their skills and outperform others in friendly competitions.

Every week, these groups practice together intensively. Tuesday and Thursday evenings are allotted for team practice sessions. The unique regional assembly, combined with the shared love for soccer, has turned these practice sessions into significant community affairs. It’s not just about playing soccer; it’s about spending time with people who share the same roots.

The result of this arrangement has been overwhelmingly positive. The camaraderie amongst the players from the same region has increased multi-fold, making the club more of a home away from home. The British group, for instance, starts their practice with a popular chant from their homeland. This has not only boosted their morale but has also nurtured a deep bond amongst the players.

Practice matches between these regional teams are a sight to behold. The Latin Americans, known for their fancy footwork, take on the disciplined and defensively strong British team. The Asian teams, with their agile and quick players, compete against the robust and physically strong African teams. These matches offer a melting pot of different soccer styles, a spectacle that the club members and spectators thoroughly enjoy.

In conclusion, the Cardinal Soccer Club is more than just a soccer club. It's a cultural melting pot, a mini-world where the global love for soccer meets regional camaraderie. Their unique practice sessions bring people closer, building not just better teams, but also nurturing enduring friendships. The club, with its perfect amalgamation of sport and culture, truly represents the spirit of soccer.","12,19,120,216,305,191,307,240,89,281,250,10,328,60,129,139,61,205,40,83,192,103,218,235,122,337,323,160,142,162,150,29,302,6,30,151,168,57,185,116,320,184,90,47,124,26,16,182,104,105,27,241,219,11,186,334,34,179,73,261,327,273,230,132,165,128,13,56,53,304,258,69,292,319,152,181,268,231,309,233,59,324,331,125,188,24,49,15,201,74,303,291,229,93,72,289,127,274,63,102,38,253,84,339,9,311,312,259,126,198,2,51,313,18,298,85,187,130,14,225,296,221,333,17,167,117,214,41,277,290,260,113,23,44,87,197,82,54,336,0,194,62,269,254,1,137,99,159,249,237,121,22,271,318,227,147,190,161,282,178,140,81,133,177,110,67,164,52,279,211,114,207,206,45,131,68,266,286,330,263,243,77,306,317,196,65,275,238,21,299,224,28,106,204,80,148,315,284,232,272","70,5,183,7,79","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
309,All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.,"The annual technology conference had just begun. People from different walks of life had come together under one roof, each carrying a unique set of interests and specialties. The atmosphere was buzzing with anticipation and excitement. However, a striking observation was that all the people who had the same interests were socializing together.

In the west wing of the conference hall, a group of software developers was engrossed in a deep discussion. They were passionately exchanging ideas on the latest trends in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Their animated gestures and the frequent nods of approval showed the power of shared interests. 

Nearby, an enthusiastic group of cybersecurity experts was busy discussing strategies for combating rising cyber threats. The intensity in their voices and the seriousness of their faces were clear indications of their shared passion for cyber defense mechanisms. They were connecting not just professionally but also personally, strengthening their network over shared interests.

In the quieter corner of the hall, a group of UI/UX designers had gathered. With sketches and laptops in their hands, they were visualizing the latest trends in design patterns. Their discussion revolved around innovative solutions to enhance user experiences. This group was drawn together by their common fascination with the aesthetic and functionality of technology interfaces.

On the other side of the hall, a bunch of data scientists was involved in a lively conversation. Their discussion was deep-rooted in numbers, algorithms, and models. Their shared interest in decoding patterns and predicting outcomes made their discussion highly engaging and absorbing.

Meanwhile, the gaming enthusiasts were impossible to ignore. Their discussions were laced with occasional bursts of laughter as they excitedly shared their experiences about the latest gaming technologies. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and E-Sports were the hot topics among them. They were perfectly at ease, brought together by their mutual love for all things gaming.

Moreover, a community of blockchain enthusiasts was found exchanging views about the potential of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. The complexity and novelty of their conversation were sure to intimidate any outsider, but they reveled in their shared interest.

By the end of the day, a unique bond had formed within each group. They all came from different backgrounds, yet they found comfort in their shared interests. The conference, thus, served as a potent ground for not only professional networking but also for finding like-minded companions. Each person left with a sense of satisfaction, a feeling of belonging, and the exhilaration that comes from engaging in passionate discussions about shared interests.","62,178,338,245,113,151,292,304,273,308,322,305,312,196,42,25,39,53,81,210,155,67,21,184,231,324,11,222,241,159,22,59,95,148,136,316,239,189,51,228,230,232,123,169,75,10,80,174,162,334,235,224,105,257,320,115,36,20,7,96,289,332,86,299,214,163,208,291,40,274,125,282,72,260,29,284,171,252,168,272,63,253,107,19,242,150,131,104,85,331,146,170,280,319,234,325,47,333,278,191,32,147,156,93,264,195,270,57,204,226,336,221,233,197,216,126,133,300,255,337,55,167,50,290,293,237,66,134,187,18,220,317,33,79,44,56,303,130,78,318,327,259,92,172,91,110,157,254,120,307,181,306,251,185,135,287,28,58,328,179,71,128,69,218,103,16,250,269,106,285,209,108,101,217,41,200,35,116,82,109,256,219,267,23,229,145,301,335,201,262,27,121,6,60,17,165,173,154,1,227","8,12,152,150,10","1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200"
310,"You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap. Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound.","John had always been a risk taker, a trait that reflected heavily in his investment strategies. Investing was his lifeblood; it kept him on his toes and gave him the adrenaline rush he craved. He was not just addicted to the rewards but also the thrill of playing the game. However, his brashness often led him to make hasty decisions, neglecting the age-old adage, ""Look before you leap.""

One gloomy evening, John was sitting in his plush office, staring at his computer screen. His attention was fixed on the plummeting shares of a tech company he had heavily invested in. The company had recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons, leading to a steep decline in its value. John was on the brink of panic. Sweat was trickling down his forehead, his heart pounding against his chest.

In a rush of panic, he thought, ""I should sell all of my shares right now. I need to minimize my losses."" It was a desperate plan, inspired by fear rather than logic.

John's longtime friend and financial advisor, Mike, happened to walk into his office at that exact moment. He took in John's sweaty face, the frantic look in his eyes, and the plunging graphs on the computer screen. Understanding what was happening, Mike immediately cautioned him, ""You can't just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap.""

Mike's calm demeanor provided a stark contrast to John's chaotic state. He reminded John that markets are volatile and that the value of the shares could rebound tomorrow. He recommended that John should study the situation more carefully rather than simply reacting to it.

Mike continued to explain, ""Making knee-jerk reactions will only lead to losses. Remember, we don't know for sure if the company's shares will continue to fall. They may bounce back tomorrow and if you sell your shares now, you could lose out.""

John was not easily persuaded, but he respected Mike's expertise. He took a deep breath, nodding slowly. He decided to delay his decision, choosing instead to observe the market fluctuations for a few more days.

As days passed, his panic subsided and he realized that he was reacting more out of fear than rationality. In a week, as predicted by Mike, the shares began to recover. The company had managed to turn around their reputation, and with it, the value of their shares began to rise again.

This experience taught John a valuable lesson, one that would forever influence his investing strategies. Sometimes, it was wiser to hold on, to watch and wait rather than hastily leaping into actions driven by fear. And the memory of that frantic day always served as a reminder for him to look before leaping.","130,275,283,306,153,56,266,244,92,327,243,238,39,128,207,55,12,261,277,127,212,312,61,135,158,223,42,229,198,24,3,22,36,31,11,315,63,252,333,16,148,111,222,68,26,110,187,74,177,58,265,190,199,33,6,296,136,40,32,337,41,147,25,155,124,235,174,115,220,257,29,259,171,304,249,242,263,299,307,313,166,118,165,279,91,157,278,76,21,5,206,38,320,15,255,224,88,48,151,72,269,276,131,317,154,167,50,51,20,138,289,311,186,219,71,309,129,264,93,66,188,119,59,0,139,10,8,300,132,69,308,107,94,282,82,323,141,52,47,83,291,228,161,195,339,318,142,239,125,84,193,62,247,101,182,100,233,105,303,314,145,301,108,267,225,96,152,102,86,316,270,133,78,200,232,70,79,126,335,143,1,14,227,262,162,106,260,156,217,305,113,120,7,251,246,331,321,230,248,121","112,22,80,160,36","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
311,It is better to gauge others before taking such political stands these days. You never know who is on your side and who will cause you harm for it.,"In this age of bitter partisanship and political divide, it has become increasingly important to measure one's words carefully, especially regarding controversial subjects. It is better to gauge others before taking such political stands these days. Social dynamics have shifted drastically, and political affiliations have become more definitive of one's identity than ever before. You never know who is on your side and who will cause you harm for it.

Take the case of John, a conservative-leaning individual living in a predominantly liberal neighborhood. His strong opinions on economic policies and gun rights were known within his community. However, he learned the hard way that it wasn't the best strategy to openly discuss politics without understanding the political leanings of those around him.

One summer afternoon, John decided to hold a casual barbecue party. His neighbors, colleagues, and friends came over. The air was filled with laughter and conversation; juicy steaks sizzled on the grill. But as the evening progressed, the topics began to shift from light banter to more serious subjects, including politics.

Feeling confident and relaxed in his own home, John broached the subject of a recent controversial gun control legislation. His robust opinions echoed in the silent backyard, as he poured forth his beliefs regarding Second Amendment rights.

What he had not anticipated was the vehement opposition from his neighbors. The serene afternoon soon descended into a fiery debate, many taking exception to his political stand. His words resonated with the mixed crowd, provoking heated arguments and tarnishing the convivial atmosphere. 

Some were outraged, voicing their concerns about gun violence. Others, taken aback by John's strong views, felt uncomfortable. They worried that a man with such beliefs was living amongst them. There were friends who pulled away, distancing themselves, not wanting to be affiliated with such thoughts. 

Soon, the garden party was no longer a pleasant gathering but a political battlefield. Voices escalated, relationships strained, and neighbors left in a huff. John watched as his guests departed, leaving him alone in his backyard amidst the ruins of his ruined barbecue party.

John realized that night that he had misjudged the situation. He had failed to understand that politics was no longer just a subject of intellectual debates but a personal conviction that defined one's social identity. It became clear to him that he should have considered the perspectives and feelings of others before taking a vehement political stand.

It was a hard lesson for John, but it was a necessary one. From then on, he vowed to approach these topics with caution, recognizing the need to gauge others before asserting his political stand. Because he understood, in these times, you never know who is on your side and who will cause you harm for it. He learned, sometimes the hard way, that it is better to listen, understand, and respect the diverse opinions that populate our society.","164,240,190,0,34,17,232,284,116,106,277,211,312,323,199,298,220,85,212,249,173,100,213,222,68,233,18,245,257,287,314,45,300,115,248,165,330,183,99,291,295,83,219,58,281,258,54,246,76,132,19,118,48,318,81,234,316,184,38,288,111,259,28,77,30,92,32,224,182,42,61,265,10,308,44,266,186,317,278,225,328,215,214,82,335,25,84,73,33,93,204,21,75,60,231,189,147,244,86,112,37,218,56,260,174,67,158,98,126,20,46,127,144,36,313,80,307,280,168,148,273,49,334,137,138,142,290,40,130,63,155,321,206,135,315,209,152,120,217,187,329,9,306,103,2,216,302,3,276,51,150,192,110,274,235,12,228,113,87,97,109,310,26,333,210,229,139,72,31,196,301,159,66,65,303,11,16,107,91,160,124,285,236,94,194,162,293,221,131,275,102,242,47,53,161,1,208,327,264,171","162,13,115,31,135","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
312,"People in the village say that the house is haunted by the ghost of the lady that lived here many years back. So, my father decides to wait to buy it so he can take more opinions from different people.","In the quaint little town where I lived, nestled between mountain ranges, there was a singular topic that dominated the conversation at local gatherings. People in the village often spoke in hushed whispers about a certain deserted house situated at the edge of town. They claimed that the house was haunted, believed to be inhabited by the restless spirit of a lady who once resided there many years prior. 

My father, a man of logic and practicality, had long had his eye on the said property. To him, it was an investment opportunity that was too good to pass up. The house, despite being old, was constructed meticulously and held a certain charm that attracted him. Moreover, the location offered a breath-taking view of the sprawling fields that lay at the bottom of the mountain.

However, he couldn't simply ignore the concerns and superstitions of our neighbors. The town was small and tightly-knit, and everyone respected each other's beliefs and sentiments. It was an unwritten rule that the haunted house was to be avoided. For someone to break that rule meant dealing with the icy stares of disapproval from the townsfolk.

So, instead of making a rash decision, my father decided to wait. He thought it would be prudent to gather more opinions from different people before going ahead with the purchase. He spoke with the elderly folks, who nostalgically recollected the lady's lifetime. They described her as a kind, gentle soul who loved the house dearly and spent her last days there.

He even had a few meetings with the town's council members, hoping to gain some practical insight. Although none of them had personally witnessed any ghostly activity, they couldn't entirely dismiss the villagers' claims either. Each member had a different perspective and a new tale to tell.

Next, he consulted the local priest, who was skeptical about the existence of ghosts but agreed to perform a cleansing ritual if it brought peace to the community. The priest's stance offered some reassurance to my father, but he knew the journey towards buying the house was far from over.

Finally, he invited paranormal investigators who had a keen interest in exploring haunted places. To his surprise, they found no substantial evidence to support the claims of a haunting, and their results seemed to favor his decision.

With all these varied opinions, my father was left with a decision to make. The villagers were still apprehensive, and their concerns were not without merit. However, the logic he held dear pointed towards the purchase. The house, even with its eerie reputation, was a gem that could be polished with love and care.

The haunting tales became less frightening as time passed, and slowly my father decided to proceed. He wanted to respect the beliefs of the townsfolk, but he couldn't let superstitions stand in the way of a valuable opportunity. After much deliberation, he decided to buy the house, promising the community to restore it to its former glory and, hopefully, lay the old lady's spirit to rest.","38,328,291,261,96,154,137,332,313,40,52,240,61,185,140,231,151,31,70,214,145,209,44,142,62,48,246,224,268,247,330,69,331,186,301,279,64,133,191,132,210,177,319,164,157,335,338,320,148,206,163,245,271,153,211,2,73,201,39,318,113,55,194,285,181,284,227,273,33,57,178,267,136,165,77,150,233,205,306,37,170,252,139,0,130,237,308,109,266,92,116,41,311,13,18,16,327,97,310,1,339,300,152,53,122,149,124,232,91,26,161,50,234,89,19,71,100,34,83,324,22,174,36,59,230,79,204,67,213,288,219,202,162,146,12,337,123,156,298,258,225,314,193,5,297,68,336,168,93,90,296,3,334,121,322,118,292,66,197,171,283,192,60,190,180,281,182,47,95,315,200,173,144,187,302,86,128,295,257,80,112,207,84,27,169,35,208,102,276,46,147,239,54,104,99,43,243,287,269,111","99,93,9,142,170","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
313,Gary started investing his money and time in creating a small garden for himself during the off season. Gary regrets not planning and starting during the spring and summer season when results are more visible.,"Once a reputable basketball coach, Gary found himself in a unique season of solitude during the off season. The buzzing energy from the games were no longer there to fill his days, and the relentless scheduling of practices had been replaced by empty hours. Intrigued by the peace he found in his limited interactions with nature during a morning jog or a midday walk, he decided to embark on a new journey, that of creating a small garden. This garden would be his personal oasis, a place to express his creativity and dedication outside of basketball. 

Gary set aside a significant portion of his savings to invest in this new venture. He also recognized that this project would not only need financial investment but also a commitment of his time, something he was willing to give. He spent days visiting local nurseries, researching about plants, and buying the necessary tools and seeds. His excitement was palpable, although he was a novice in this field. His only companions were gardening books, tutorial videos, and occasional advice from his neighbour, a seasoned gardener.

Despite all these efforts, however, there was one detail Gary overlooked, and he deeply regretted it: the timing. He started his gardening venture in the fall, unknowingly missing out on the prime growing season. The ideal time to start, he would soon discover, was during the spring and summer seasons. This was the period when the warmth of the sun, combined with plentiful rainfall, provided the perfect nurturing conditions for plant growth.

He only came to realize this crucial fact when he noticed his garden's slow growth. Gary felt disappointed. All his efforts seemed to be fruitless and his anticipated sanctuary remained barren. It wasn't the garden that he had envisioned, and he felt disheartened.

Despite the disappointment, he kept researching, learning from his mistakes, and tending to his garden with the same dedication. He would inspect each plant daily, giving them the nourishment they needed. He kept his spirit high, motivating himself by thinking about the lush green oasis he hoped his garden would become.

The off season ended, and so did his gardening journey for the time being. As Gary got back into his coaching routine, he promised himself that he would restart his gardening project, but this time during the spring. He had learned the hard way that even the best-laid plans could fail without proper timing. Yet, he looked forward to the next gardening season, more knowledgeable and ready to try again. Despite his initial failure, Gary found happiness in his new hobby and eagerly awaited the growth and beauty of his garden in the spring.","112,279,194,203,166,146,322,118,122,102,201,71,43,113,339,291,225,15,316,253,318,144,227,33,117,40,100,262,161,164,223,327,92,277,143,151,119,218,157,205,197,281,93,256,6,202,206,211,241,104,270,213,229,96,226,41,66,244,196,110,39,86,304,44,35,153,259,246,224,200,265,57,263,94,289,272,147,185,295,302,70,314,177,36,154,12,276,285,188,261,14,247,288,46,334,10,199,0,169,294,136,307,175,91,306,332,264,312,266,65,186,108,3,243,326,89,198,38,249,75,4,275,88,183,47,338,299,130,210,239,233,324,37,101,52,9,156,168,280,116,139,184,124,329,282,335,274,45,163,109,191,284,323,176,58,217,99,328,258,208,310,298,83,287,140,59,209,228,134,98,309,319,301,315,212,155,77,171,330,127,30,305,115,311,308,111,135,13,240,64,138,18,28,286,31,303,293,193,82,189","161,184,108,82,174","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
314,"No need to take so much work this quarter, as performance won't impact appraisals. Work more in the next two quarters when the management will actively prioritize it.","Adam had always been a high achiever at work, thriving on tight deadlines, and complex projects. He had an inherent need to outperform others and himself constantly. Yet, he found himself in a peculiar situation when his supervisor, Mr. Howard, advised him quite differently. 

""No need to take so much work this quarter, Adam,"" Mr. Howard started one day at a casual coffee break discussion. He explained that the quarterly performance wouldn't impact appraisals this time. This was perplexing for Adam, as he was known for being the go-getter who always volunteered for extra work.

Mr. Howard went on, ""The company's current focus isn't on individual performances."" Adam listened attentively, the bustling noises of the office suddenly turning into a muted hum in the background.

""Instead,"" Mr. Howard continued, ""We're concentrating on redefining our strategy and streamlining processes. We're looking at the broader picture this quarter.""

Adam nodded, still finding it hard to digest this sudden shift in his approach to work. He was so used to constantly pushing himself, this new guidance seemed alien. 

""I suggest you work more in the next two quarters,"" Mr. Howard added before taking a sip from his cup, ""That's when the management will actively prioritize individual performances.""

His supervisor's words bounced around Adam's head for the rest of the day. Could he really ease off the gas pedal this quarter? The thought was comforting yet strange. 

He decided to give it a try. Instead of loading his plate with multiple projects, he selectively chose only a few. He allocated more time to each project, focusing on quality over quantity. 

As the quarter progressed, Adam noticed a significant change. He was less stressed, more focused, and surprisingly, his output quality was better than ever. The revelation was shocking - could less really be more?

By the time the next two quarters rolled around, Adam was ready. Rejuvenated and better focused, he stepped up his game and took on more responsibility. 

These quarters, where performance mattered for appraisals, he was ready to showcase his true potential. He had learnt the value of strategic work timing from Mr. Howard’s advice. It was not always about working hard but working smart. 

So, when the appraisal time came, Adam was pleased but not surprised to see that his performance ratings had soared. He thanked Mr. Howard silently for his valuable advice and made a mental note to pass this wisdom along to his future subordinates.

315,Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.,"Samantha had always been a careful saver, tucking away a few dollars from her paycheck every week into her savings account. Over time, those few dollars had added up to a substantial sum. It was not an amount to be squandered lightly, especially on something like a plane ticket. Samantha had an adventurous spirit and she loved to travel, especially during the holidays. This year, she had her heart set on a trip to Rome.

It was her dream holiday destination, with its historic architecture, world-class cuisine, and bustling city life. She had been saving for years specifically for this trip. However, when Samantha looked at the flight prices for the holiday season, she was shocked. It was nearly double the regular fare. It would require a large chunk of her savings.

Her friend, Maria, saw the stress on Samantha’s face. She knew all about Samantha’s holiday plans and how important this trip to Rome was for her. Sensing her predicament, Maria advised Samantha to wait before she booked her tickets. Maria explained that flight prices usually dropped significantly after the holiday rush. 

However, Samantha was anxious. She was afraid that if she waited too long, she might miss out on her trip altogether. Maria understood her worry but tried to convince her of the practicality of her suggestion. Samantha respected Maria’s opinion, considering her travel experience and knowledge about such matters.

Grudgingly, Samantha decided to heed Maria’s advice and hold off on booking her flight. In the following months, Samantha kept a close eye on the flight prices. With each passing day, her fear of missing out on her dream vacation was being replaced with a growing excitement for an economical travel plan.

Then came the day when Samantha saw a significant drop in the flight fares. The drop was so substantial that it almost made the holiday prices seem absurdly high. And the best part was that it still left a considerable amount from her savings untouched.

Overjoyed, Samantha booked her flight immediately. She was proud of herself for making a wise decision and grateful to Maria for her sound advice. She realized how important it was to plan wisely and not rush into things, even if they seemed incredibly tempting.

This experience taught Samantha a valuable lesson about patience and financial planning. As she prepared for her dream trip to Rome, she was filled with a sense of achievement. Samantha learned that she should not spend all her savings on flight tickets during the holidays but should wait and check after a few months when the prices were low. She realized the importance of having some financial cushion for unexpected expenses and emergencies.

And so, not only did Samantha get to enjoy her dream vacation in Rome, but she also did it while making sound financial decisions. This experience made her trip even more memorable, knowing she did it the smart way.

316,The deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations.,"After countless hours spent in corporate conference rooms, sleepless nights, and stressful days filled with apprehension, the deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations. John, the lead negotiator for ProTech Enterprises, had traveled across continents to finalize the multi-million dollar deal with the Asian tech giant, Zenobia Corp.

The negotiations had started almost six months ago. Back then, John, as an ambitious young man, had proposed the risky idea of partnering with Zenobia Corp. His bosses were initially skeptical, but the potential benefits were too significant to ignore. Thus, they gave John the green light, pushing him into a whirlwind of complexity and tension.

In the first round of negotiations, the contrast between John's straightforward American negotiating style and the Zenobia team's patient, detail-oriented approach caused some friction. Both sides walked away from the table with a grim understanding that this was not going to be an easy path. 

The second round was no less challenging. The Zenobia team demanded a higher profit share, questioning ProTech’s marketing capabilities. John, on his part, defended his company passionately, assuring Zenobia of ProTech's strong market presence and unmatched sales record. The discussions were heated, the mood tense. The day ended without any agreement.

During the third round, John decided to change tactics. He started understanding the Zenobia team's concerns and patiently addressed them, showing them detailed reports and projections, proving ProTech's future potential. The Zenobia team seemed intrigued but remained undecided. 

A few more rounds went by without a decisive breakthrough. It seemed as though the deal would fall apart, and John's career with it. However, John wasn't the type to give up easily. He worked day and night to create an unassailable case for the partnership, remaining steadfast despite the seemingly insurmountable hurdles.

Finally, the day of the decisive negotiation arrived. John presented a comprehensive plan addressing all of Zenobia's concerns while also highlighting ProTech's advantages. The discussion went on for hours, with each side dissecting the plan minutely. At last, after what seemed an eternity, the Zenobia team agreed to the partnership. Their signatures on the contract signaled the end of this tedious and challenging journey.

The tension and exhaustion suddenly dissipated, replaced with elation and relief. The deal was finally in the bag. As he stepped out of the Zenobia office, John's face broke into a wide grin. He had done it. Despite all odds, he had brokered the most significant deal in ProTech's history. A victory won not only for his company but for his determination, patience, and resilience.","22,297,113,168,21,196,87,324,70,101,274,142,295,135,227,67,202,194,32,143,150,144,331,308,52,289,25,48,104,106,19,275,193,178,244,240,212,152,0,224,190,198,76,54,78,171,332,10,47,77,140,290,233,64,166,9,31,137,129,123,283,191,187,59,259,203,29,262,80,68,50,111,121,321,169,55,327,319,250,180,13,18,285,131,79,155,214,186,211,165,4,279,172,213,305,145,153,276,205,122,120,124,139,237,85,200,83,189,71,98,247,3,197,149,226,254,133,39,72,204,298,65,292,163,154,222,195,209,210,51,58,313,132,75,206,42,302,90,95,338,108,116,188,320,27,66,110,8,2,257,201,94,161,37,293,208,232,15,261,127,223,249,141,336,34,176,231,294,318,273,41,291,258,184,30,12,253,38,281,217,317,284,57,185,277,92,175,323,236,225,239,182,136,60,86,334,1,53,5,306","181,169,78,144,74","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
317,The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal.,"The sun was setting, casting long, dramatic shadows across the stadium. The crowd had gathered, creating an electrifying atmosphere. They were all excited to see their favourite team in action. It was an extremely crucial match, one that could possibly decide the team's fate in the championship. 

The excitement was palpable. Roars erupted from the crowd as the two opposing teams took their positions on the field. Tension hung heavy in the air, almost tangible. The referee's whistle signaled the beginning of the match. 

The first half was a balanced affair. Both teams scored a goal each, their fans cheering on every move. The players were giving it their all, displaying impressive skill and determination. Every pass, every tackle and every shot at the goalpost was cheered or booed, depending on who you were supporting.

As the half-time whistle blew, both teams walked off the field. The score was tied at 1-1. The players returned to the locker rooms, sweat-soaked and breathless. Both sets of fans were on edge, eagerly waiting for the second half.

As the second half commenced, the tension only increased. Each team scored again, making the score 2-2. The game was getting more intense with every passing minute. 

The players were putting in every ounce of their energy, each team trying to get that crucial lead. The crowd was on its feet, chanting and cheering, creating a maelish atmosphere. 

Just as the game was approaching its end, there was a sudden spark of brilliance. The star striker of the team, known for his knack for scoring at crucial times, made his move. He received a pass from his teammate, outpaced his marker, and with a swift swerve, he was in front of the opponent's goal. 

Before anyone could react, he took the shot. The ball soared in the air, slicing through the tension. Time seemed to slow down as the ball headed towards the goal.

The crowd held their breath, the goalkeeper dived but fell short. The ball hit the back of the net, and an ear-splitting roar erupted from the crowd. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal. 

Jubilant fans screamed and cheered as the striker was mobbed by his teammates. It was a day of victory, a day of glory. The game that was balanced on a knife-edge was decided by a moment of brilliance. And that brilliant moment was destined to be remembered for years to come.","269,149,49,324,253,303,298,204,55,66,262,104,138,294,162,169,157,78,245,44,221,174,129,77,109,64,318,144,333,233,93,186,133,164,242,276,300,176,74,33,205,339,295,110,268,25,270,91,310,256,220,172,181,83,175,1,141,195,98,211,173,278,184,219,45,17,65,67,96,183,80,335,79,2,190,3,54,187,243,293,155,237,230,279,125,22,218,121,135,99,28,182,326,152,145,250,292,32,59,241,192,87,252,76,159,52,313,314,58,160,132,212,94,240,118,271,53,263,334,189,275,126,289,139,70,179,224,134,170,261,223,309,307,123,267,42,229,196,337,280,92,244,320,21,308,95,166,319,36,264,287,180,216,100,327,231,43,56,20,71,316,283,168,301,191,89,29,107,103,51,288,227,197,150,202,248,10,246,200,232,61,63,217,331,81,127,6,105,143,62,291,140,47,273,4,206,321,34,163,31","161,27,148,143,197","1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200"
318,"After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.","The clamor of the campaign trail had been Jack Sullivan's life for over seven long months. The daily grind of speeches, debates, rallies, and never-ending photo ops had drained him. However, his endurance had paid off as it seemed to all that the seasoned politician had all but secured the election.

Sullivan, a charismatic democrat, had spent most of his adult life in public service. From his early days as a passionate city council member to his steady climb up the political ladder, he had always been guided by one simple belief: that he could make a difference.

His main rival, Republican candidate Tom Harrison, was a ruthless businessman with deep pockets. Harrison had initially appeared to have a significant advantage with his unlimited resources. But money couldn't buy him what Sullivan had in spades: authenticity and an honest connection with the people.

The polls had only confirmed what Sullivan had sensed on the ground: his policies, his authenticity, and his passion were resonating with the public. His lead was comfortable, and his campaign team was becoming increasingly confident about their victory. But Sullivan knew better than to take anything for granted. As a seasoned politician, he knew that politics was a game of uncertainties.

Sullivan continued to pound the pavement, deliver speeches, and participate in rallies. Every handshake mattered, every conversation was essential, and every voter was crucial. He focused on his campaign promises, detailing the progress he planned to make in healthcare reform, climate change, and income inequality.

His campaign team followed his lead, working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure their candidate's success. They spent hours examining polls and strategizing, their dedication driven by a shared belief in Sullivan's vision for a better future.

Meanwhile, Harrison’s campaign tried to undercut Sullivan's success with slanderous ads and unfounded claims. However, the negative campaign only seemed to alienate voters, confirming Sullivan's authenticity in contrast to Harrison's desperate attempts.

As election day neared, the palpable excitement around Sullivan's campaign was almost infectious. Voters lined up at his rallies, celebrities endorsed him, and the media covered his campaign with an almost feverish intensity. His lead in the polls continued to widen, and it seemed as though victory was inevitable.

And on election day, after months of relentless campaigning and a lifetime of dedication to public service, Jack Sullivan's persistence and conviction seemed to have paid off. As the election results streamed in, the politician had all but secured the election, affirming that the will of the people was indeed stronger than the depth of a pocket. But despite the clear lead, Sullivan remained humble, knowing that the real work lay ahead. His victory was not just a personal achievement but a mandate to effect the change he so passionately fought for.","292,116,156,157,20,17,333,269,194,152,274,223,184,314,77,295,138,297,339,283,317,197,327,49,284,228,36,25,315,248,306,120,319,163,103,55,201,42,231,106,276,198,206,312,37,160,169,287,304,142,52,7,180,256,89,271,174,321,171,96,243,179,323,60,85,258,313,59,224,118,24,98,172,56,108,139,2,105,199,215,91,33,182,1,190,298,43,79,30,70,47,192,11,186,285,259,66,265,222,245,239,255,22,165,13,278,320,144,291,279,83,226,261,46,296,78,41,8,35,34,183,200,168,76,191,69,211,193,18,48,147,288,216,29,237,6,9,51,325,58,100,73,90,123,294,125,308,93,107,202,311,230,253,236,136,217,162,275,130,238,293,128,115,301,204,254,26,247,148,235,135,249,173,145,334,316,290,289,75,132,225,161,322,86,45,212,63,153,111,54,28,241,260,309,303,233,280,38,16,112","176,21,33,107,58","1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
319,The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.,"After years of struggle and countless job applications, Jacob finally felt the wave of victory wash over him. The job, the one he had been chasing for nearly three years, was finally his. The news came after his last interview, which had gone extremely well. His heart was pounding when he received the call from the company's Human Resources Department.

Jacob couldn't contain his joy and excitement. His thoughts instantly went back to the beginning of his journey. The long nights spent studying, the countless internships, the constant honing of his skills - everything finally seemed to pay off. This job was not just any job; it was his dream job, something that would set his career path right.

Recalling the interview, he realized it had not only gone well, but it was the best one he'd ever had. The panel, which initially seemed intimidating, turned out to be quite congenial. They had asked him various complex questions, testing his knowledge and skills, but he had answered each with confidence and clarity.

The smile on his face grew wider as he remembered how the chief panelist had appreciated his vision for the future of the company. He had discussed strategic planning, and how he intended to help the company grow with innovative ideas. His comprehensive understanding of the company’s business model had surely won them over. This appreciation was the turning point, he was sure.

Despite his nerves, he had managed to show his passion and dedication to the field, something he believed had played a huge role in securing the position. The firm handshake from the panelists at the end of the interview was a sign that he had made a positive impression.

Jacob felt a sense of accomplishment. His perseverance and patience had finally borne fruit. The path had not always been easy; the many rejections and failures had sometimes made him question his capabilities. But now, all the self-doubt and frustration seemed to be worth it.

Filled with a newfound confidence, he began planning his first day at the office. He visualized himself making a significant impact within the organization, contributing to its growth, and reaching new professional heights. It was a moment of triumph, a validation of his hard work and his belief in himself.

320,"Everyone thought that he would lose, but he made a comeback through herculean effort.","Everyone in the small town of Charleston assumed that Mike would lose in the regional wrestling championship. He was set to face a fierce competitor, Damian, who was well known for his unbeatable strength and swift moves. Mike was a local boy, loved for his kind heart rather than his athletic prowess. The faith the townsfolk placed in him was more out of affection than belief in his abilities. They all thought he would lose, but Mike was not deterred.

Sweat trickled down his forehead as he entered the wrestling ring. The audience erupted in applause, but it was more out of sympathy rather than optimism. Damian stood on the opposite corner, a menacing figure, flexing his biceps and smirking confidently. All of this did nothing to intimidate Mike. He was determined to not let down his well-wishers. 

Despite the overwhelming odds against him, Mike started training with an unmatched ferocity. He woke up at dawn to sprint uphill, lifted heavy rocks, and even trained with old wrestlers to learn their techniques. His stamina grew with each passing day. He endured blisters, cramps and muscle pulls, but not once did he falter. His coach, an ex-champion himself, admired Mike's determination and relentlessly pushed him to his limits. 

The day of the match finally arrived. The entire town of Charleston had gathered to cheer for their beloved boy. Mike entered the arena, looking more muscular and confident than he ever had before. His heart pounded in his chest as he stood across Damian, who still maintained his arrogant smirk. But Mike was not the same boy who had been underestimated by all. 

The referee blew the whistle and the wrestling match began. Damian, sure of his win, went after Mike aggressively. Mike, using his learned techniques, cleverly dodged and attacked Damian. The crowd gasped as he managed to pin Damian down once, then twice. Damian was visibly bewildered by the unexpected challenge he was facing. 

As the match neared its end, Mike was running out of energy. He had given it his all. But a picture of his well-wishers in his mind stirred up a herculean effort within him. Drawing strength from within, he grappled with Damian one last time. In an unforeseen turn of events, Mike pinned Damian down for the third time. The referee blew his whistle, declaring Mike the winner. 

In the stunned silence that followed, one could hear a pin drop. And then, the crowd roared in elation. Mike, the underdog, had pulled off an unlikely victory. His herculean effort had paid off. Against all odds, he had made a comeback, making his town proud.

321,"Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.","Daniel had always been a devoted employee. Working as an accountant at a top-tier finance firm for eight years, he had consistently shown his diligence, dedication, and a deep understanding of the industry. He had an unbeatable reputation for being the first one in the office every morning and the last one to leave each night. Weekends or holidays didn't slow him down; his commitment was unwavering.

Despite his hard work, he often felt overlooked. His department was vast, filled with bright and promising individuals equally chasing promotions and recognition. Daniel knew he was just one amongst many in this corporate pool. But he didn't let this dampen his spirits; instead, he chose to focus on his passion for his work.

One Monday morning, during their quarterly meeting, the management made an unexpected announcement. The room filled with a pin-drop silence as they started discussing promotions and recognitions. This was a moment he had been waiting for, although he had no idea what was about to happen.

The managers acknowledged the employees' hard work and dedication, and as a continuation of the theme, started to talk about diligence. They narrated a story of an employee who had shown utmost dedication, reliability, and perseverance through all the highs and lows. As they dropped hints, Daniel started to feel a sense of familiarity but brushed it off, thinking it was wishful thinking.

Then, they called out his name. Recognition from management, specifically for his diligence, was something Daniel had not anticipated. Shocked, he stood up, the applause echoing in his ears. His coworkers, whom he'd spent countless hours working alongside, clapped and cheered for him. He walked towards the podium, feeling a mixture of pride and disbelief.

He had earned it. Years of his unwavering hard work, sleepless nights, and relentless learning had finally paid off. As he received the recognition, a wave of satisfaction washed over him. Daniel had reached a milestone in his career that he had long dreamed about. The feeling was overwhelming.

The management then announced the promotion. Daniel was named the new Senior Accountant of the firm. The room exploded with applause again. His colleagues approached him, offering their congratulations. As he stepped down from the podium, he felt like he was walking on air.

His diligence had not only earned him the respect of his peers but also had brought him a step closer to his dream. Daniel knew that this was just the beginning of a new journey, and he was more than ready to take it on. The recognition from the management had fueled him even more, inspiring him to continue working with the same intensity and dedication.

The promotion was not just a step up in his career. It was a validation of his efforts, a testament to his diligence, and a reward for his passion. Daniel knew he had made the right choice by never giving up, and he looked forward to facing new challenges with the same tenacity and determination.","169,306,320,183,178,163,65,86,249,18,201,276,167,334,218,41,108,256,152,194,184,174,213,51,319,230,33,154,241,40,47,111,94,30,289,148,64,312,0,34,95,120,195,337,19,36,180,255,224,220,72,205,263,125,58,126,80,113,294,251,238,257,83,313,300,150,239,142,15,204,143,67,265,76,336,259,115,206,234,328,46,236,109,165,127,275,157,273,164,274,138,333,250,130,61,140,13,146,144,92,286,209,223,89,5,203,136,330,308,7,102,303,212,231,73,304,331,293,17,185,192,145,170,119,121,2,295,141,227,70,32,228,84,123,137,62,4,79,322,318,302,272,26,247,105,287,329,301,305,35,244,98,31,87,110,245,188,131,315,187,54,243,55,269,85,248,237,129,57,100,159,262,316,309,63,332,186,81,222,118,278,177,211,44,117,175,338,311,75,43,149,199,317,310,258,202,50,285,240,221","173,193,140,25,3","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
322,"They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.","The Jones family had a story, one they never liked to bring up at family gatherings or reunions. It revolved around their eldest son, Olive, who was once the pride of the family. That was until the events that transpired a few years ago. They had all been so hopeful about Olive's future. His charm, intelligence, and good looks promised a prosperous future.

However, Olive's life took a different turn, and the family was left in shock and disbelief. The Joneses were a traditional lot, staunch believers in old-fashioned values, values they expected their son to uphold. Unfortunately, Olive fell short, quite drastically so.

Olive had been engaged to a beautiful, kind woman named Lucy. They'd met at university, fallen in love, and before they knew it, they were planning a future together. The entire family loved Lucy and looked forward to welcoming her into their tight-knit clan.

That is until Olive made a decision that shattered the family's idyllic dreams. On a business trip to Europe, he met a woman named Isabella. Isabella was a free spirit, full of passion and spontaneity, traits that Olive was undoubtedly drawn to.

It wasn't long before Olive found himself in a whirlwind romance. He was caught between the expectations of his family and the newfound excitement that Isabella brought into his life. As each day passed, Olive found it increasingly harder to resist Isabella's charm.

One day, he made a reckless decision. Olive ended up marrying Isabella in a secret ceremony in Rome, despite being engaged to Lucy back at home. When the news reached his family, they were heartbroken. Lucy was devastated, and Olive's actions led to a significant rift in the family.

His parents were filled with shame and disappointment. The once close-knit family was fractured, and their golden boy was now their black sheep. No one wanted to talk about Olive anymore, and his name became a taboo in their household.

In their eyes, Olive had forsaken his family and the woman who loved him dearly. The damage he had done was irrevocable, and he became a distant memory, an unwanted reminder of a painful past. 

Every time Olive tried reaching out, his family shunned him away, refusing to forgive him for the mistake he made. The only thing they wanted was for him to realize the magnitude of his actions. So, they stopped mentioning Olive's name, and with time, they learned to move on without their eldest son. They wished he could have been different, but they realized some things were beyond their control.

And so, Olive became the Black sheep of the Jones family, a somber chapter in their family's history. It's a painful tale, but a tale that needed to be told, a reminder of the consequences of reckless decisions.","318,286,44,53,210,189,321,323,67,63,206,88,117,177,65,6,274,243,174,195,47,118,41,21,15,216,331,273,250,244,326,70,163,295,137,62,30,307,24,313,231,50,249,253,85,89,312,205,325,226,212,200,55,190,299,296,43,31,258,335,128,121,113,16,19,11,236,269,143,311,59,136,324,100,92,101,167,193,8,316,157,218,10,26,225,252,327,156,289,112,187,221,153,91,162,228,188,263,334,317,165,284,81,61,315,69,267,336,132,77,110,105,233,27,149,2,197,333,201,68,134,181,93,202,119,159,196,279,17,272,34,7,217,33,183,329,215,256,178,207,330,66,224,138,328,135,293,306,131,22,282,1,338,182,49,142,32,147,237,40,109,20,87,25,230,13,45,130,259,227,198,148,0,35,18,203,191,76,214,99,129,111,29,83,86,141,64,84,238,140,3,102,222,255,294,300,160,72,120,115","8,73,49,31,87","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
323,Sandy is the only one who doesn't show up to the dance class and one of us is always without a partner because of it.,"Dance class had always been a steady beat in our weekly schedules, a symphony of coordinated footwork and artistic freedom. It was a small class, consisting of nine students, which normally would have been an inconvenience due to the nature of partnered dances. Yet, we were a close-knit group who had managed to find a rhythm, each of us perfectly aligning with another. Except for Sandy.

Sandy, with her wild red hair and infectious laughter, had always been a key component of our dance class. Her energy was unparalleled, her dedication unwavering. But recently, Sandy stopped showing up. 

Week one was curious, her missing form a noticeable void. Week two was worrying, the room seemed unbalanced without her. By week three, it was clear; something was wrong. We reached out, concerned messages flowed from our fingers to her screens, but they went unanswered. We even went to her apartment, only to be met by a distant, unnerving silence.

Though we were concerned for Sandy, the effect of her absence on the class was profound. Our instructor tried to rearrange our partnerships, but someone was always left out. Like a tango with a single dancer, it was an odd, uncomfortable sight to behold.

It was Jackie, usually paired with Sandy, who took the brunt of her absence. Jackie, so shy and hesitant, had always relied on Sandy's vivacious enthusiasm to push her forward, to keep her moving. But without Sandy, Jackie would stand awkwardly to the side, her gaze lowered, a whispered rhythm lost without its melody.

Our dance instructor, a man as fiery as the salsa, was growing increasingly frustrated. His attempts to rotate partners or incorporate solo routines proved futile. It was clear: Sandy's absence had thrown us offbeat.

Our dance class, once a vibrant whirlwind of motion and energy, had lost its glow. Our steps were still in rhythm, our bodies still moved with the music, but the soul of our dance had disappeared with Sandy. Her infectious energy, her unrestrained joy, it had always been the unseen force that drove us. 

As we tried to continue, we realized we had not only lost a dancer, we had lost a crucial part of our spirit. We took a step back and acknowledged that we were not just a dance class - we were a family. We needed Sandy, not for the practicality of having an even number, but for the joy and unity she brought to us.

We never did discover why Sandy stopped attending dance class. But her absence showed us something: we weren't just a group of dancers. We were a harmonious entity that thrived on each other's rhythm and energy. Her absence left more than just a partner without a pair; it left a void that could not be filled by anyone else. Sandy was, indeed, an irreplaceable element of our dance class, of our family.","112,6,45,221,181,42,198,50,56,17,73,228,177,263,322,131,183,159,214,292,49,54,156,118,256,102,128,142,229,255,216,150,163,250,14,186,24,152,325,193,168,290,114,282,146,204,89,71,120,106,215,313,295,236,95,64,304,12,202,223,179,190,84,122,100,30,127,48,98,81,259,294,4,141,331,224,247,317,166,299,39,276,125,157,333,139,254,134,123,249,40,287,195,78,27,252,22,184,245,328,234,337,145,164,275,302,60,270,149,220,76,207,10,35,80,74,99,219,109,130,289,37,191,326,126,327,212,1,28,244,329,5,62,20,334,233,7,85,308,70,200,119,136,211,59,324,237,36,88,187,3,117,44,41,225,55,197,32,33,203,47,265,280,116,189,169,138,283,305,0,243,79,301,9,43,104,174,173,19,296,246,314,34,161,311,69,232,238,107,272,38,268,319,199,16,153,143,286,206,26","15,146,39,124,126","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
324,Jim is the only one from our group who has engaged in any sort of criminal activity. Only Jim has ever spent time in jail.,"Our friend group was made up of five individuals: Sam, Bobby, Alice, Jim, and myself. We were a mixed bag of talents, quirks, and characteristics. However, there was one quality that set Jim apart from the rest of us; Jim was the only one who had ever engaged in any sort of criminal activity. In fact, he was the only one among us who had ever spent time in jail.

Jim's dark past became known to us when we were in our mid-twenties. We were all sitting around our usual corner table at the pub one night, sharing stories from our pasts when Jim, looking noticeably uncomfortable, finally divulged his secret. His confession sent a cold shock of disbelief through our group. Jim, our funny, caring, and dependable friend, had a past we had never imagined.

As the words came out of his mouth, the atmosphere around our table changed drastically. He began by saying he was involved in criminal activities as a teenager. With the wide-eyed attention of all of us upon him, Jim spoke about his troubled youth. His mother passed when he was barely fourteen, leaving him and his younger sister under the care of a neglectful and abusive father.

He told us that he joined a local gang out of desperation and need. Engaging in small-time burglary and drug dealing, he was soon caught by the authorities. His voice wavered as he admitted to spending nearly two years in a juvenile detention center. He emerged a changed person, vowing to never return to his previous life. He took on two jobs and managed to finish his education, earning a scholarship to the local community college.

Our eyes were wide with a mixture of disbelief and respect. Even in the stark reality of his admission, we could not ignore the resilience and determination it must have taken him to overcome his past.

As he concluded his story, there was a heavy silence around the table. We all looked at Jim, seeing our friend in a new light. His confession brought us closer; it was a stark reminder of how little we really knew about each other.

Our conversations that night, and those that followed, changed our group dynamic. We saw Jim's dark past not as a flaw, but as a testament to his strength and resilience. While Jim was the only one among us who had ever stepped foot in a jail, he was also the only one who had the courage to change his life so dramatically.

That revelation drew us closer as a group. We learned that our shared pasts and secrets only strengthened our bond.

325,"Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.","Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I listen when told to do something, and I follow rules to the letter. It's just in my nature to be like this, and I see no problem with it. I have no intention of deviating from this well-trodden path I've set for myself. Now, it would be a glaring mistake to assume that everyone in my family shares these same virtues. The same definitely cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. 

Nathan is a maelstrom of energy, a tempest always brewing, a wildfire waiting to engulf everything in its path. He is the direct opposite of my personality. If there's one person in our family who always lands himself in trouble, it's Nathan. It's as if he has a kind of magnetic attraction towards chaos and upheaval, and it follows him around like a desperate puppy. 

His adventurous spirit would often see him disappearing into the woods, returning with torn clothes and a scratched face. At family gatherings, while everyone else sat around the table, Nathan was known to suddenly stand, drag a hapless relative onto the dance floor, and begin to twirl and twirl, oblivious to the protests. At school, he was always the notorious class clown, always playing practical jokes that left his teachers exasperated. He had been suspended three times in the last year alone and, while the school administration was at their wits end, my Aunt Marjorie always laughed it off as ""Nathan being Nathan"".

His wayward nature and defiance did not earn him many fans in our family. There were frequent complaints, heated arguments, and sometimes, icy stares. People would often compare him with me, which I hated. It would be, ""Why can't you be more like your cousin?"" or ""Learn some discipline from him"". I knew these comparisons weren't fair, but people seemed to overlook that.

Yet, despite his ways, there was something I admired about Nathan. He dared to be different, dared to be loud, and dared to step out of the box society had built for us. He didn't bend under the pressure of others' expectations; instead, he chose his own road, however rough and winding it was. 

Nathan's rebelliousness created discord at times, true, but it also instilled a sense of freedom that was intoxicating. And although many in the family disapproved of his boisterous demeanor, it was impossible to ignore the charm and undeniable charisma that clung to his being. He was wild, free, and untamed.

In reality, Nathan and I were two sides of the same coin, balancing each other out. I was quiet and obedient; he was wild and disobedient. Though polar opposites in our disposition, we fit perfectly within the puzzle that was our family. And though he often found himself in hot water, his spirit was, in many ways, the backbone of our family. No matter the situation, his fire never diminished, and that was something I couldn't help but respect.","39,204,18,177,81,195,37,329,255,320,55,262,297,311,19,184,137,176,324,127,254,222,202,110,92,167,299,217,264,330,120,119,263,245,100,90,145,191,69,115,136,313,169,87,131,315,316,15,193,42,268,70,174,144,3,296,161,233,123,188,10,171,134,112,1,12,334,107,199,229,336,71,175,281,159,156,323,151,230,253,278,223,282,25,260,36,26,196,76,155,201,121,11,275,220,113,99,240,56,211,251,209,138,243,235,198,82,308,149,31,78,164,247,194,234,279,210,89,289,33,43,250,219,77,53,86,258,312,190,91,186,269,114,50,72,288,322,203,27,21,24,22,135,60,59,208,23,172,300,108,286,327,88,326,228,224,239,48,261,271,294,109,168,166,62,170,283,8,236,200,75,40,30,213,38,14,101,96,339,102,317,157,303,163,67,94,165,51,307,73,206,129,180,265,66,225,319,105,249,63","137,77,19,154,152","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
326,"The A team is the best one as it has the best players except Ron, who often negates the others' efforts.","Once upon a time, in the small town of Rayfield, the most thrilling event was the annual football championship. The town was divided into four teams: A, B, C, and D. The A team, proudly referred to as the Alpha squad, was known to be the finest among all. It wasn't simply because they had a brilliant coach, or the team spirit was high, it was primarily because the A team boasted the best players in town. 

Each member of the A team was unmatched when it came to skill, agility, and technique. The town folks placed high bets on this team every championship season. Every player on the team was remarkable, but Ron was an exception. Though he was an excellent player, his attitude was a drawback.

Ron's individualistic tendencies often overshadowed his raw talent. He was so fixated on outshining everyone that he didn't realize that football was, in the end, a team game. Instead of complementing his team, Ron often negated the others' efforts. His obsession with being in the spotlight, his inability to pass the ball at critical moments, and his arrogant demeanor towards his teammates were starting to affect the team's performance.

Everyone in the A team was aware of this problem. Coaches, team members, and even spectators noticed Ron's behavior. They recognized how his self-absorption was causing unnecessary strife within the otherwise harmonious team. The results were apparent; matches that could've been won easily were turning into nerve-wracking struggles, all thanks to Ron.

However, the players on the A team were also aware of Ron's immense potential. If harnessed properly, they knew he could be their biggest strength. With the championship approaching, the team decided to have an intervention for Ron. They confronted him about his behavior and how it was affecting the rest of the team.

Initially, Ron was taken aback and defensive. He rejected their observations, and claimed they were just jealous of his talent. This didn't discourage the team; they persisted and got him to understand the gravity of the situation.

Over time, Ron began to see the damage his attitude was causing. He realized that his individual success meant little if it was at the expense of his team's morale and victory. Slowly but surely, Ron began to change. He worked on being a team player, both on and off the field. 

The transformation was not immediate, but the team's patience and perseverance paid off when the day of the championship arrived. In the final match, Ron's skillful play combined with his newfound team spirit led the A team to victory. The best team had indeed proved itself, but not without overcoming some significant challenges. The story of the A team and Ron became a lesson for the whole town, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and collective effort over individual success.","141,322,294,131,82,241,285,137,42,97,150,19,172,230,55,243,61,125,210,37,233,320,316,85,277,324,156,23,101,188,26,39,52,134,327,214,108,202,119,200,145,170,295,305,311,1,161,237,104,69,221,208,225,32,50,290,110,33,57,212,330,196,289,168,186,287,151,17,259,144,121,299,155,231,235,94,250,321,81,309,80,185,286,218,307,75,325,13,314,27,58,265,308,136,297,271,8,296,215,255,90,118,275,315,22,111,300,68,67,229,73,10,12,268,323,216,298,240,273,9,191,117,164,336,51,140,109,252,166,115,46,153,163,16,64,274,245,223,318,280,238,2,128,247,162,59,292,263,29,232,53,48,0,267,198,92,303,93,213,187,272,129,36,40,60,302,246,220,45,167,158,319,335,106,84,179,14,70,66,227,190,123,86,28,114,205,177,253,206,310,334,222,18,282,127,261,317,266,256,99","2,115,26,87,35","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
327,"All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.","Celine had always harbored a deep love for music. This love drove her to tirelessly hone her craft until she became a proficient singer and songwriter. She penned down soulful lyrics and matched them with hauntingly beautiful melodies, crafting songs that left audiences captivated. After years of dedication and hard work, she decided it was time to gift the world with a piece of her soul through her debut album.

The album, titled 'Echoes of My Soul', had a total of twelve songs. Each song was a work of art in itself, reflecting her unique style and the depth of her talent. They spanned an array of genres, showcasing her versatility as an artist. The emotional depth, compelling melodies, and raw, potent lyrics of her songs provided a deep insight into her life experiences and perceptions.

Listeners were instantly drawn to the authenticity and passion seeping from each track. The first song on the album, ""Harmonized Chaos,"" was a powerful introduction that captivated listeners with its mesmerizing rhythm. ""Abyss,"" the fourth song, struck a chord with its hauntingly beautiful melody. Songs like ""Fractured Memories"" and ""Dancing Shadows"" were poignant narratives of her struggles and triumphs, eliciting strong emotional responses from listeners.

Audiences fell in love with the brilliant rendition of ""Unspoken Words,"" an acoustic ballad, and danced to the exhilarating beats of ""Fireflies and Stardust,"" a delightful blend of pop and folk. ""Verses of the Heart"" touched upon unrequited love, resonating deeply with many. 

Each song on the album was a unique masterpiece, eliciting admiration for Celine's extraordinary talent. However, it was the last song that left listeners perplexed. Named ""Discordant Symphony,"" it was starkly different from the rest of the album. The upbeat tempo clashed with the melancholic undertones, creating a confusing auditory experience. It lacked the emotional depth and authenticity that were the highlights of the other songs.

Some music critics described it as a ""mood killer"" while others termed it as ""out of place."" Listeners agreed; they felt the last song marred the overall vibe of the album. Though 'Discordant Symphony' was catchy in its own right, it simply didn't fit into the narrative of 'Echoes of My Soul.'

Despite the one hiccup, the overwhelming consensus was that Celine had outdone herself with her debut album. But the discordant finale served as a gentle reminder to her and her audience that even the most beautiful melodies could hit a false note. Nonetheless, Celine took the critique in stride, vowing to reflect more cohesively in her future creations. The last song might have ruined the vibe, but it definitely didn't diminish the overall impact of her enchanting musical journey.","309,227,54,33,278,141,103,13,311,289,253,35,181,77,336,24,296,321,193,185,159,246,87,276,165,110,158,248,316,180,83,272,101,163,109,323,285,329,143,68,38,25,298,308,105,79,228,5,127,234,189,263,153,192,95,331,201,84,86,202,132,168,134,155,145,156,293,81,195,207,59,177,72,300,2,209,11,151,198,338,314,229,190,301,295,131,219,304,256,82,66,154,233,48,149,108,28,172,245,325,212,297,247,75,305,125,335,85,205,92,236,216,324,73,137,119,36,30,152,17,279,43,136,244,306,326,223,45,63,176,6,135,243,157,249,315,164,232,171,284,277,206,218,147,71,18,56,273,161,96,88,254,334,257,199,118,8,104,61,76,142,319,169,322,221,121,267,197,220,99,139,10,65,288,283,123,1,64,12,268,97,339,29,80,179,260,217,102,0,170,14,178,241,34,74,167,262,258,62,333","164,36,113,100,126","1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
328,"If you don’t go to sleep early, you will wake up late. As you sow, so shall you reap.","Once upon a time, in a small picturesque town, nestled between green rolling hills, lived a young boy named Charlie. Charlie was a lively child, full of energy and known for his bright, curious eyes that sparkled with mischief. Everyone loved Charlie, despite one persisting habit of his that drove his family to their wits' end: his refusal to go to sleep early.

Each night, despite his mother's cajoling and his father's stern warnings, Charlie would stay awake, engrossed in his story books or absorbed in his intricate toys. The soft glow from his bedside lamp would remain on for hours past his bedtime, casting shadows in his room filled with the hum of his activities.

As dawn would break, Charlie’s parents would leave for their respective jobs while he remained sound asleep. His mother, a nurse, would kiss him gently on the forehead before leaving and his father, a carpenter, would tussle his hair with a resigned smile on his face. 

Despite their pleas and warnings, the pattern remained unbroken. If you don’t go to sleep early, you will wake up late, they would tell him time and time again. Unfortunately, their words fell on deaf ears as Charlie continued to indulge his nocturnal habits.

One day, the mayor announced the annual town fair, a highlight in the town's calendar, anticipated by all, but none more than Charlie. His eyes would sparkle with anticipation thinking about the fair, filled with games, treats, and thrilling rides. The fair, however, was scheduled to begin early in the morning.

Charlie's parents saw an opportunity to teach him a lesson about his disruptive sleeping schedule. They informed him that they would be leaving for the fair promptly at the break of dawn and warned him about the consequences of staying up late. ""As you sow, so shall you reap,"" his mother gently told him.

Disregarding their advice, Charlie once again stayed up late, lost in his world of adventure and imagination. As expected, when the morning arrived, Charlie was still sleeping soundly, oblivious to the chatter of the morning birds and the golden rays of the early sun.

True to their word, his parents left for the fair, leaving a still sleeping Charlie behind. They felt bad about leaving him but they hoped this hard lesson would finally make him understand the importance of a proper sleep schedule.

When Charlie finally woke up, he found the house empty and a note from his parents on the kitchen table. Reading the note, he realized he'd missed the fair. His heart sank and a wave of regret washed over him.

From that day forward, Charlie never stayed up past his bedtime. He finally understood the wisdom in his parents' words: If you don’t go to sleep early, you will wake up late. He remembered the heavy truth in the proverb his mother had quoted, ""As you sow, so shall you reap."" From then on, Charlie reaped only the benefits of a good night's sleep.","278,227,91,249,181,109,182,120,156,208,133,216,55,141,97,219,101,14,218,324,225,322,48,108,203,165,2,161,279,202,64,188,264,99,274,125,16,178,98,201,270,246,269,338,74,143,136,223,43,174,243,11,89,28,248,118,330,115,268,209,213,331,194,315,146,58,283,92,250,205,289,87,7,102,86,114,275,286,104,59,241,285,231,138,25,238,126,78,293,67,215,82,158,38,334,251,144,176,22,192,116,306,273,95,9,35,31,57,235,308,236,3,56,229,139,266,303,21,323,107,327,272,155,265,247,106,244,307,200,295,184,282,316,117,4,309,61,193,196,167,53,168,159,237,0,135,65,332,190,62,1,185,198,170,221,191,30,276,122,147,187,84,39,79,100,230,137,54,212,6,234,329,267,254,301,304,172,119,318,180,259,333,210,40,93,94,195,18,177,76,121,317,189,298,171,81,160,169,112,226","172,57,62,148,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
329,How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?.,"Once upon a time in a small town named Springfield, lived a young boy named John. John was an average student in a bustling high school, who generally made the effort to do well in his studies. However, there was one particular trait of John's that often got him into trouble - procrastination.

John had a particular fondness for mathematics but was least interested in history. His history teacher, Mr. Perkins, was a stern, no-nonsense man who valued discipline and dedication. He often said, ""If you wish not to fail, prepare yourself well in advance.""

One day, Mr. Perkins announced an important history test scheduled for the following week. He strongly advised the students to prepare thoroughly, emphasizing its relevance in the final grading. However, John paid no heed to Mr. Perkins' advice, thinking it was a subject of little importance.

Day after day, John postponed studying for the history test. He was too busy indulging in his love for math and playing video games with his friends. ""History is about dead people and long-forgotten events,"" he told himself. ""How can it be more important than solving problems that train my brain?""

On the day of the test, John entered the classroom feeling confident. He thought that his general knowledge would be enough to get him through the test. As Mr. Perkins distributed the question papers, John's heartbeat quickened slightly, but he managed to brush off the feeling of anxiety.

The moment he read the first question, his confidence wavered. As he skimmed through the rest, his heart sank. There was not a single question that he could answer properly. The questions were about specific events, dates, and individuals. It wasn't like the broad, conceptual questions of a math test, which he could derive from first principles. History, he realized, required specific knowledge.

Looking around, he saw his classmates engrossed in writing while he sat there, blank. A sudden realization hit him hard; he was about to fail. He had underestimated the test, the subject, and Mr. Perkins’ warning. He knew then that he had done himself a disservice.

The dismissal bell finally rang, marking the end of the excruciating hour. John walked up to Mr. Perkins, his paper as blank as his face, and handed it in. The disappointment in Mr. Perkins' eyes was something John would never forget.

After the failed test, John kept asking himself, ""How can you expect not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?"" From that day forward, John made a pact with himself never to underestimate any subject, or test. And for every test after that, he studied - not just to pass, but to learn and understand. He had learned a lesson that went far beyond history, a lesson about responsibility and preparation.","296,104,272,196,53,129,194,251,289,131,117,239,148,317,140,302,240,260,8,34,119,298,93,244,151,288,100,164,273,203,256,135,97,308,311,339,168,159,87,170,1,246,55,167,14,103,171,254,2,69,35,295,185,299,267,9,174,225,158,44,58,226,234,19,101,235,220,275,74,122,49,328,85,278,292,134,80,332,109,78,207,205,4,266,105,304,213,306,189,218,75,274,325,152,96,245,198,248,155,32,211,150,39,219,232,229,293,99,33,264,63,176,184,321,208,128,314,98,192,307,43,29,326,209,56,123,249,143,201,3,243,82,118,221,45,197,121,23,42,161,265,147,54,130,20,333,90,162,261,312,294,309,327,22,322,40,84,59,11,102,91,73,94,283,38,61,132,337,126,305,268,200,222,285,89,36,127,330,65,146,238,230,144,331,154,252,41,186,153,30,156,276,12,324,92,277,72,282,231,114","72,178,184,78,146","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199"
330,"Fred built an immense fortune by swindling others, but he lost it all when someone swindled him.","Fred was a character well known in the bustling city of New York. He had gained his status as one of the city's richest men, not by birthright, nor by some spectacular innovation. Fred was infamous for his ability to twist the truth, manipulate situations, and outwit his business counterparts. He built an immense fortune by swindling others. 

His practices were ethically wrong, but according to the law, he had been smart enough to avoid any significant penalties. He had turned his charm and charisma into powerful tools, using them to convince others into deals that primarily favored him. Some who were unfortunate to cross paths with him became financially ruined due to his crafty games of smoke and mirrors.

Fred lived the life of a king. He owned a grand penthouse in Manhattan, drove the most expensive cars, and traveled the world in private jets. His fortune seemed endless, and his life, utterly invincible. 

His weekends were spent wining and dining influential personalities in his waterfront estate. The movers and shakers of the city would reluctantly turn up, bearing broad fake smiles, for nobody dared to ignore an invite from Fred. Behind closed doors, however, they would pray for his downfall, wishing for some form of justice to befall him.

As for Fred, he reveled in his power, misinterpreting the fear he inspired for respect. He continued his fraudulent endeavors, becoming more ambitious and audacious with each swindle. He lived under the illusion that he was invincible, that he could outsmart anyone.

Then came along Jasper, a newcomer to the city's business scene. He was young, ambitious, and incredibly intelligent. Underneath his unassuming exterior lay a shrewd mind, one that saw through Fred's strategies like transparent glass.

Jasper, unlike Fred’s other victims, was not awed by the allure of quick wealth. He patiently watched and learned, studying Fred's tactics with intense scrutiny. He refused to be another pawn in Fred's crooked game. 

Instead, Jasper devised a plan to swindle the master swindler himself. It was risky, but he was determined to restore balance to the business community that had been wronged by Fred's deception.

With careful patience, Jasper executed his plan, outsmarting Fred at his own game. Fred, blinded by his ego and greed, fell right into the trap. He invested all his wealth in a venture that promised astronomical returns, oblivious to the fact that it was a cleverly constructed illusion by Jasper. 

When the venture inevitably fell apart, Fred lost everything. His immense fortune, built on the misfortune of others, vanished overnight. His penthouse, cars, jets - all were seized to pay off the debts he had accumulated.

Fred was left penniless, a bitter irony considering his previous lifestyle. The city watched in shock as the once invincible swindler faced his downfall, swindled by the very tactics he had used to build his empire. Despite the damage he had caused, there was a sense of poetic justice to Fred's situation.

In the end, Fred was left to reckon with his actions. His swindling had built him an empire, but it was the same swindling that brought it crashing down. His life became a cautionary tale, a lesson for the city and its inhabitants about the consequences of deceit and greed.","53,192,13,43,128,118,97,136,275,137,206,36,265,105,185,30,19,102,167,31,17,194,189,84,37,74,245,303,34,121,291,15,82,332,140,155,241,168,249,163,295,197,270,6,75,315,120,158,170,10,153,77,152,138,160,223,326,219,260,145,157,273,294,305,64,39,304,200,329,177,231,201,284,178,70,35,247,212,123,71,240,230,122,89,91,45,146,133,297,307,147,95,218,58,171,125,266,52,311,331,156,325,38,255,244,188,79,203,119,115,42,216,4,54,256,92,81,63,282,237,59,150,312,274,57,323,85,336,229,96,299,222,7,144,130,191,320,279,228,76,214,338,55,78,224,108,306,253,142,80,161,103,166,40,22,233,62,292,261,113,267,93,126,234,141,1,328,235,26,25,181,132,131,5,276,154,49,33,186,242,99,333,110,215,90,179,246,211,264,324,117,271,11,94,296,46,257,337,143,339","167,69,100,34,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
331,"He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.","There was a man named Douglas, who was exceptionally talented in his business dealings. Known far and wide for his financial acumen, he had built an empire from scratch. But there was something people didn't know about Douglas; he had a dark secret that he had managed to hide from the world for a long time.

From his early business days, Douglas developed a dislike for the governmental taxation system. He felt it was unfair to give away large portions of his hard-earned income. Year by year, his dislike turned into avoidance. Douglas began to look for loopholes in tax laws, finding ways not to pay taxes. This was his secret; for years, Douglas had been tax evading.

Douglas was not simply a tax avoider; he was an artist at it. He would shuffle around his business assets, create offshore accounts, or sometimes even declare lower income. It was a sophisticated and complex system, hard for even the most seasoned financial investigators to catch.

As Douglas's wealth increased, so did his confidence in outsmarting the government. He believed himself invincible, which further encouraged his unethical business practices. He lived a lavish lifestyle, which was no secret to the world. The extravagant parties at his mansion, luxury cars, expensive art collections - everything screamed of wealth. And yet, Douglas reported an almost meagre income.

While Douglas enjoyed his lifestyle, he failed to notice the eyes that had started prying into his affairs. The authorities had grown suspicious of his reported income and extravagant lifestyle. They opened an investigation, to explore the discrepancy in his financial matters.

The investigation took years. It involved going through years of financial records, unearthing his offshore accounts, even international cooperation. It was a slow and meticulous process, but the evidence against Douglas was piling up. Slowly but surely, the tax evasion case against him started gaining momentum.

One day, when Douglas was returning from one of his many business trips, he was taken into custody. The years of deceit had finally caught up with him. His secret was out in the world, and his empire was beginning to crumble.

In court, Douglas was found guilty of tax evasion. The years of avoiding taxes, the years of unethical business practices, the years of a secret life had finally come to an end. Douglas, the once celebrated business mogul, was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for tax evasion.

No more lavish parties, no more luxury cars, no more expensive art collections. The man who thought he could outsmart the government ended up losing everything. His failure to pay his due caused his downfall. And it all ended where it started; with his contempt for paying taxes.","107,164,179,315,338,30,142,33,32,125,192,202,264,211,276,207,195,219,163,117,95,11,269,218,6,232,304,127,172,221,52,183,298,295,288,112,130,335,84,90,73,326,310,162,98,100,214,220,145,103,224,229,290,271,216,56,285,249,83,323,109,45,329,265,31,251,133,282,46,206,193,268,75,7,238,102,309,69,144,306,250,312,318,303,13,71,35,240,124,110,9,105,25,154,328,85,115,169,80,129,39,277,300,94,230,166,137,42,222,36,153,197,307,74,161,257,248,89,167,188,233,131,152,51,245,22,132,113,292,332,184,330,204,279,136,198,3,278,311,49,263,182,272,38,1,70,158,244,199,86,296,91,26,65,149,121,64,150,81,111,261,201,126,93,2,327,234,321,62,339,255,82,92,78,322,301,138,293,313,205,336,171,146,79,106,236,287,253,258,333,116,128,12,159,239,88,190,27,157,139","95,63,132,130,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50"
332,She has been talking trash about us all week to everyone. So I don't feel sorry for her when someone spilled all her secrets.,"Samantha and I used to be the best of friends. We did everything together, and we told each other everything. There were no secrets between us, or so I thought. It wasn't until senior year of high school when our friendship started taking a downturn.

Ever since the school year started, Samantha started acting differently. She was hanging out with a different crowd - the popular kids. She started wearing designer clothes and more makeup, and she barely spent time with me anymore. It wasn't long before I heard murmurs about her talking trash about me behind my back.

""She has been talking trash about us all week to everyone,"" my friend Jenny informed me one day, a somber look on her face. I was incredulous, thinking it must be some misunderstanding. However, Jenny wasn't the only one who told me this.

As the weeks rolled by, more and more people began to come forward with tales of Samantha spreading false rumors about us. It was heartbreaking. We used to be inseparable, and now she was intentionally trying to tarnish our reputation. The hurt was unimaginable.

One day, during lunch, I watched as Samantha laughed and whispered with her new friends. It was obvious they were talking about me. That's when an unexpected ally came into the picture: Emily, Samantha's ex-best friend from the popular crowd.

Emily was fed up with Samantha's antics and decided to spill all her secrets in retaliation. She revealed to the entire school about Samantha's lies, the rumors she spread, her fake designer clothes, and even her sneaky tricks to climb the social ladder. 

I watched as Samantha's face turned pale, her eyes wide in shock. The tables had turned, and she was now the one being gossiped about. Her friends started distancing themselves from her, not wanting to be associated with her any longer.

At first, I felt a pang of sympathy. She was my friend after all. But then I reminded myself of the pain she caused us. I didn't feel sorry for her when Emily spilled all her secrets, she had brought it upon herself. It was a tough lesson for Samantha but a necessary one. The rest of the school year passed with Samantha learning the hard way about the value of friendship and the destruction that rumors and gossip can bring.

The experience served as a harsh wake-up call for Samantha. She ended senior year with fewer friends than she began with. As for me, I moved on, stronger and wiser, realizing that true friends are those who have your back, not those who stab it.","267,174,249,166,33,288,226,156,229,167,165,89,217,275,66,40,198,76,104,269,339,325,131,157,112,328,137,179,26,6,149,79,152,85,81,211,146,301,326,38,297,286,175,299,82,273,58,99,245,277,196,264,322,118,135,140,88,224,61,142,120,207,256,296,216,28,83,281,283,105,276,190,225,333,206,300,329,16,72,236,27,323,23,162,331,319,187,148,113,147,310,189,42,132,5,214,109,126,259,158,95,327,336,272,330,29,263,262,70,94,36,219,2,37,121,238,200,52,231,192,302,213,293,282,12,320,130,258,96,4,317,177,169,304,80,133,22,117,316,227,338,252,91,68,153,98,138,284,11,324,1,34,151,172,246,291,201,208,43,250,59,334,50,71,243,24,102,234,129,240,199,204,305,125,251,87,168,44,295,119,141,56,18,62,308,306,260,19,289,195,321,230,17,127,271,74,212,170,90,107","26,77,105,85,74","1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200"
333,The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.,"Once upon a time, there lived a young, mischievous boy named Oliver. Oliver lived with his family in a small, idyllic village perched on the edge of a vast forest. His family owned the largest sheep farm in the village, making him responsible for their herd. Oliver’s job was to keep an eye on the flock, protecting them from any danger.

However, Oliver was mischievous and always eager for some excitement. He was infamous among the villagers for his knack for trouble and his impish sense of humor. It was his wit, however, that led him to an infamous mischief - the habit of crying wolf.

One sunlit afternoon, when the daily routine had started to bore him, Oliver decided to have a little fun at the expense of the villagers. He ran through the village streets, shouting in terror, ""Wolf! Wolf! There's a wolf attacking our sheep!"" His desperate cries triggered an immediate response. The villagers, caring and brave, rushed towards the pasture, ready to confront the wolf and protect their livestock.

But there was no wolf. 

Oliver stood by the pasture, laughing hysterically as the villagers returned, grumbling about his childish antics. It was hilarious to him. However, his prank was not well received by the villagers who began to trust him less with each false alarm. Despite their repeated pleas, Oliver continued his wolf-calling pranks, dismissing the idea of any consequences.

One day, while Oliver was again on his watch, a sudden chill ran down his spine. He froze as he noticed a pack of real wolves skulking out from the forest edge towards his flock. The color drained from his face. In terror, he sprinted towards the village, desperately crying, ""Wolf! Wolf! The wolves are coming!""

His cries echoed through the village, but no one moved. His previous antics had taught the villagers not to trust his words. They dismissed his cries as another prank, going about their work, no longer willing to fall for his tricks.

Left with no other choice, Oliver tried his best to shoo away the wolves, but he was too terrified and weak compared to them. The wolves attacked the flock, scattering them into the forest, their bleats of terror echoing eerily.

By the time the villagers realized the truth, it was too late. The damage had been done. Oliver's family lost most of their flock that day, a devastating blow to their livelihood. 

The young boy could only stand by, watching helplessly as his family's livelihood was decimated. He had learned his lesson in the hardest way possible. His mischievous cries of wolf had cost him dearly. The boy who cried wolf indeed got his comeuppance when the wolves truly came. From that day forward, Oliver learned the importance of honesty and the destructive consequences of lying.","232,225,328,266,324,268,133,235,13,125,60,80,17,256,21,161,335,290,49,317,147,30,25,169,120,8,286,314,318,54,251,115,186,206,244,106,155,19,31,273,275,303,326,330,102,239,55,87,170,331,52,32,175,64,71,97,100,188,3,116,90,267,191,46,195,119,337,339,202,304,234,265,78,281,329,62,23,156,253,152,75,280,258,154,270,221,212,98,298,72,171,77,233,48,179,252,320,118,107,159,22,230,288,219,167,302,122,209,12,4,10,89,283,139,43,44,292,238,110,95,108,59,308,213,196,263,166,210,293,260,176,194,332,231,193,197,185,276,93,261,285,203,305,117,56,245,14,9,243,226,278,124,69,24,216,319,91,29,178,105,271,63,104,45,57,130,123,135,306,215,291,173,334,137,279,149,27,85,151,224,272,229,68,312,103,180,296,294,325,67,228,129,201,218,284,208,134,34,227,217","3,75,44,50,133","1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"
334,"She wanted to buy a dress in case someone asked her to the dance, but I told her not to count her chickens before they hatched.","Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was petite and often seen donning a shy smile on her face. She was introverted and had always been more comfortable in her own company than that of others. 

On one sunny afternoon, Lily walked into a boutique that she had often admired from afar. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at the various dresses on display. She had a particular reason for her visit that day; the annual school dance was just a month away. Her secret crush, Jake, a popular and charming boy, was the one she hoped to go with. He was her classmate, and she had had feelings for him ever since she laid her eyes on him.

She picked out a lovely red dress that she thought would look stunning on her. The dress reminded her of the beautiful roses in her mother's garden, making her believe it was the perfect choice. She hoped that wearing it to the dance would catch Jake's attention.

That evening, I met Lily at our favorite cafe. She was beaming with excitement, and I could tell she had something on her mind. As her best friend, she confided in me about the dress and her reason behind buying it. She hoped that Jake would ask her to the dance, and that she could impress him with her beautiful dress.

I gently laughed and asked, ""Lily, did Jake ask you to the dance?"" She looked down and confessed, ""No, but I'm hoping he will.""

I held her hand and said, ""Lily, you are an amazing person. And it's completely normal to have such expectations. However, it's also important not to count your chickens before they hatch."" 

She gave me a puzzled look, so I further explained. ""This means don't make plans based on future events that may not happen. For instance, buying the dress without a certainty of attending the dance.""

Lily looked disappointed, but she understood my point. We continued our coffee date, discussing more light-hearted topics. I hoped that Jake would ask her to the dance. But, more importantly, I hoped that Lily would understand that she didn't need to impress anyone to be loved. Lily was wonderful just as she was, whether she had a beautiful red dress or not.","315,85,180,46,131,313,93,212,269,257,100,69,98,43,151,177,332,127,148,87,192,125,271,97,71,336,277,187,301,288,181,322,186,256,157,134,108,279,189,302,306,173,226,95,96,289,320,2,79,17,166,217,215,15,126,76,307,266,83,39,56,153,57,329,116,103,13,335,37,10,227,174,308,42,183,299,326,248,59,246,321,304,185,138,339,338,218,16,303,201,253,7,80,260,20,213,214,179,285,208,121,267,295,170,167,254,128,99,204,327,207,291,276,263,239,132,8,45,228,240,309,27,247,310,65,21,84,176,165,86,196,34,129,190,175,233,202,203,91,164,101,162,72,197,234,270,159,282,135,82,300,139,232,31,26,225,223,25,117,89,140,154,316,77,210,182,191,68,88,268,41,195,305,147,235,220,244,317,58,262,319,199,70,74,337,216,273,146,188,119,281,9,11,136,284,242,224,109,328,259","68,26,185,86,85","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
335,"He wanted to buy a big house and a car, but his father advised him to get a job first.","Once upon a time, in the small, bustling town of Cambridge, lived a young man named Robert. He was an ambitious lad with big dreams. He desired to own a big house, with spacious rooms, a lush garden, and a fabulous pool. He also dreamed of a shiny, luxurious car parked in the driveway of that house.

All this was not the result of his vanity, but the desire to provide comfort for his future family. But there was one problem, Robert was unemployed. He had recently graduated from college with a degree in business, but hadn't yet started his career journey.

One day, he mustered up the courage to discuss his dreams with his father, a wise and experienced man. Robert animatedly expressed his desires, how he wanted to buy a big house and a car. His father listened patiently, nodding occasionally.

After Robert ended his talk, there was a silence. His father, understanding his son's ambitious nature, knew it was time to offer some sage advice. ""Robert,"" he began, ""it's great to have dreams and ambitions. However, they should be rooted in reality.""

Robert felt a bit puzzled. His father continued, ""Son, before aiming to buy a big house or an expensive car, you should secure a stable job."" He pointed out that Robert's dreams were reliant on a sturdy financial footing. 

""Without a job, you can neither finance your dreams nor maintain them,"" his father said earnestly. Robert looked at his father, his initial enthusiasm replaced by confusion. ""But father, I thought after obtaining my degree, everything else would simply fall into place,"" Robert confessed.

His father, with a gentle smile, clarified, ""A degree is indeed important, Robert. But it's just the start. It unlocks doors to opportunities, but it's your responsibility to walk through them.""

""You must strive to land a job, work hard, and earn money,"" his father advised. ""Only then can you think about buying a house or a car."" The father's words were hard but true. He was trying to mold his son's dreams into achievable goals.

That evening was a turning point in Robert's life. He realized the importance of a job before making grand plans. He understood his father's words; dreaming was easy but turning dreams into reality required hard work and dedication.

The following day, Robert started his job hunt with renewed vigour. He went for interviews, internships, and networked with business professionals. He realized that every step was an effort towards his dream house and car.

Robert knew he had a long way to go, but he was more determined than ever. He wanted his father to be proud of him. And he knew that by securing a good job, he would take the first step toward his dreams. He was determined to make both his father's advice and his dreams a reality.","145,252,281,251,318,306,119,330,334,241,174,167,98,215,264,312,223,142,332,37,186,214,253,141,170,286,249,144,12,166,56,122,165,326,305,130,289,133,97,138,135,287,184,39,70,307,196,89,94,87,63,81,48,163,93,212,69,204,315,168,20,41,32,44,266,121,224,221,172,337,38,197,291,7,220,250,300,327,161,83,129,126,328,42,45,107,338,64,271,232,36,262,116,182,123,187,143,284,283,227,33,288,268,95,259,263,22,1,231,265,195,54,308,27,67,6,91,244,269,211,261,147,150,237,270,188,78,53,275,245,336,73,13,55,65,219,177,277,75,282,10,226,331,156,72,0,298,210,180,194,82,255,189,276,21,118,17,111,216,285,25,30,160,217,92,228,80,106,115,8,79,132,235,74,313,28,339,114,14,152,50,225,201,181,46,294,198,11,146,61,137,316,171,325,100,317,190,108,71,319","9,131,70,87,177","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
336,Mary started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done.,"Mary, an ambitious and hard-working project manager at a top tech company, had been toiling tirelessly for weeks on end. She'd been working on a crucial project that she knew could be pivotal for the company's future. The project was technologically advanced and required relentless work, which left Mary longing for a break. She needed some time to rest and recollect herself.

One evening, she found herself idly scrolling through exotic vacation destinations on her laptop. Pictures of sandy beaches, lush forests, stunning mountains and historical cities filled her screen. Looking at the serene pictures, she started fantasizing about making vacation plans, far away from the buzz of the city and her demanding job. A smile began to stretch across her face as she imagined herself soaking up the sun on a beautiful beach.

Before she knew it, she had started planning her dream vacation. She spent hours researching destinations, accommodations, and flight options. She started to plan an itinerary, which included all the activities she loved, such as hiking, sightseeing, and trying new cuisines. Excitement welled up in her as she began to daydream about this much-needed break.

However, just as she was about to book her flight, reality struck her like a bolt of lightning. She sat back, frowned, and remembered the pending project at work. She realized that she might not get leave until the project was done. This was a crucial time for her team, and her absence could derail the project's progress and delivery.

Suddenly, the sunny beach seemed like a distant dream and her office desk loomed large in her mind. She felt a knot in her stomach as she contemplated the amount of work that was waiting for her. The dream vacation would have to wait.

Reluctantly, she closed the travel websites and turned her laptop off, pushing the dream of her perfect vacation into the depths of her mind. She promised herself that once this project was successfully completed, she would reward herself with the holiday she had been dreaming of.

Mary got up, went to bed and set the alarm for the next day. She knew the road ahead was tough, but she was resolved to complete her project. And whenever she felt overwhelmed, she'd take a minute to dream about her future vacation, knowing that it would be the light at the end of the tunnel.","277,72,109,250,318,234,270,305,65,289,11,181,247,76,34,19,41,203,228,79,18,67,171,199,95,292,49,172,136,290,218,25,311,0,300,77,23,214,238,40,174,269,312,295,271,274,338,327,200,213,14,33,35,169,26,222,190,85,78,164,173,237,184,252,304,302,264,179,39,145,147,303,101,175,42,297,71,46,62,98,267,196,158,81,104,248,323,117,225,143,15,133,60,84,102,275,44,266,1,31,113,125,16,308,5,148,151,29,288,166,259,21,198,61,242,22,89,160,287,3,162,75,294,182,28,244,73,229,124,43,27,226,122,59,337,255,63,224,108,328,97,142,37,286,319,334,68,47,276,321,265,186,296,251,99,261,201,132,209,140,54,314,51,339,183,53,69,185,195,70,285,279,193,139,129,202,245,115,332,58,50,306,17,268,120,55,82,211,260,335,149,315,293,123,197,157,240,325,309,170","146,190,135,47,164","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
337,"Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.","Larry, a simple man with a profound love for literature, had always idolized Nathan Grant, the award-winning author of countless best-selling novels. For years, Larry's dreams were filled with thoughts of meeting his literary hero and engaging in enlightening conversations about plot complexities, character development, and the magic of storytelling. It just so happened that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity had arisen: Nathan Grant was scheduled to appear at a book signing and meet and greet event in Larry's home city.

Larry had been on cloud nine ever since the announcement had been made. His dreams were finally coming within his grasp, yet a significant obstacle stood in his way. Despite checking his mailbox religiously for weeks, no invite had found its way to him. His heart sank a little more each day as the mailbox remained cruelly empty.

The bookstore, a local favorite known as ""The Battered Spine,"" was hosting the exclusive event. It was famous for its elusive, 'invite-only' functions that were treasured experiences for the literary enthusiasts lucky enough to attend. Larry, despite being a frequent patron, had not received his golden ticket to the event.

Larry's friends knew of his deep admiration for Nathan Grant and sympathized with his situation. ""Don't worry, Larry,"" they told him. ""You're one of the most loyal customers. They wouldn't forget about you.""

Larry, however, was a realist. He knew not to pin all his hopes on receiving an invitation, but it didn't dampen his disappointment. 

Days turned into weeks, and the day of the event was fast approaching. Larry's heart clenched a bit tighter each time he retrieved nothing but bills and advertisements from the mailbox. With every passing day, the prospect of meeting his literary icon was fading further into the abyss.

The day before the event, Larry decided to pay The Battered Spine a visit. He felt a strange connection with the place, as it was where he had discovered most of Nathan Grant's literary works. As he walked in, he felt a chill run down his spine. 

Maria, the bookstore owner, greeted Larry with a heartwarming smile. She reached behind the counter and presented Larry with a neatly wrapped package, saying, ""We've been holding this for you.""

With shaking hands, Larry unwrapped the package. His heart skipped a beat as he glimpsed the familiar gold of the invite nestled inside. Overwhelmed with emotions, he looked up at Maria, who smiled and said, ""We couldn't forget our most loyal customer now, could we?""

With tears welling up in his eyes, Larry thanked Maria profusely. Walking out of the store, he clutched the invite tightly. It was not just a piece of paper; it was a golden ticket to fulfill his dream of meeting his favorite author. Larry went to bed that night, his heart buzzing with excitement for the event he had yearned to attend.","285,24,50,72,218,90,58,87,12,30,247,60,20,212,312,121,299,260,156,109,115,324,191,52,48,214,134,298,237,117,333,27,325,256,195,83,140,295,13,255,185,108,225,106,125,53,220,197,34,127,75,85,110,275,98,3,25,278,206,189,124,318,231,261,296,235,236,249,21,290,160,99,274,330,142,66,335,97,213,63,176,17,136,150,321,119,302,306,308,257,91,187,271,38,78,223,31,204,96,303,26,59,248,184,76,199,35,202,161,49,270,149,137,43,9,153,177,203,88,262,252,104,232,301,250,93,139,258,293,79,111,297,18,200,120,338,36,61,240,157,194,54,15,319,221,172,122,1,55,315,241,283,339,192,16,102,175,286,180,107,224,228,222,273,336,32,217,73,138,311,307,113,92,287,69,251,328,268,242,269,128,284,77,100,116,186,314,165,233,144,334,163,95,167,238,65,152,259,188,230","191,77,165,136,153","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
338,John wanted to build and paint the nursery without having heard the adoption agency's decision.,"John Wakefield had always been a patient man, but the past few months had tested his endurance to its breaking point. As a successful architect, he was known for his knack of constructing beautiful structures. However, his latest project was far from professional. His excitement was focused on a small room nestled in their cozy two-story home - a room he was eager to transform into a nursery.

This passion had sparked in him even though he and his wife, Sarah, were still awaiting the adoption agency's final decision. The process had been painstakingly slow and emotionally demanding, but John remained hopeful. Even Sarah was skeptical about their chances and couldn't bear the thought of decorating a room that might remain empty. John, however, thought otherwise.

To him, building and painting the nursery before the adoption agency's verdict was an act of faith. It was a testament to his unwavering belief that soon, they would be welcoming a new member into their family. His mind was filled with thoughts of colorful mobiles, stuffed animals, and a crib with the softest blankets. He envisioned late nights soothing the baby to sleep, and early mornings watching them wake up to the dawn.

John shared these dreams with Sarah, who at first resisted. She was afraid to get her hopes up, thinking it would only result in further heartbreak. John was persistent and eventually, she decided to let him carry on with the project. After all, she knew he needed this, it was his way of coping with the anxiety.

His hands moved with precision and delicacy, treating every brushstroke and every hammer blow as a form of love, a promise to their unborn child. He painted the walls a soft pastel yellow, a color representing warmth and happiness, filled with aspirations of joyous memories to be made.

He selected the furniture meticulously, ensuring each piece radiated comfort and safety. Sarah watched him from the doorway, her skepticism gradually replaced by a sense of admiration and love for John. She began to share in his excitement and even started to imagine herself reading bedtime stories in that very room.

Days turned into weeks, and the room slowly transformed. John’s faith became infectious. Sarah too began to pray for the adoption approval. She imagined holding their child in her arms and the feeling brought her immense peace. 

Finally, the day arrived when they received a letter from the adoption agency. Their hearts pounded as they slowly unfolded the paper. The nursery was ready, the house was filled with love and anticipation, all they needed now was their child. As they read the letter, their faces lit up with joy. Their patience and faith had finally paid off. It was a ""Yes"". The nursery wouldn't remain empty after all.","295,3,6,15,114,311,127,98,50,129,86,269,154,119,183,35,0,107,150,189,47,245,58,201,319,259,310,9,61,84,169,172,266,82,213,275,314,184,27,56,32,318,308,330,135,46,43,225,11,292,118,163,203,24,44,224,160,260,221,323,252,332,196,242,262,222,145,34,315,116,170,324,228,339,105,331,76,327,247,208,7,302,60,268,207,272,309,136,335,174,173,197,336,81,176,102,294,125,185,151,115,254,158,124,299,21,10,243,29,241,4,20,233,265,281,175,73,54,139,202,40,236,256,75,96,240,251,263,337,131,59,179,138,264,293,1,249,290,237,142,270,285,261,171,177,313,95,220,218,198,93,306,67,144,140,248,274,85,307,152,19,77,123,186,106,301,143,88,305,97,277,147,45,64,113,62,134,120,227,51,13,36,195,159,288,108,165,2,101,187,25,42,111,321,103,153,162,193,328,334","200,89,93,129,74","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99"
339,Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to.,"Sarah was always a dreamer, with a penchant for planning out even the tiniest details in her life. She had always had a clear vision of what she wanted her life to be like. Right from a young age, she had dreams of an enchanting love story. One where she would fall head over heels in love with a man who would be just as in love with her.

Sarah had always known she was a romantic at heart, and the thought of her own wedding and the subsequent honeymoon filled her with uncontainable joy. She envisioned herself walking down the aisle in a pristine white gown, getting ready to marry the man of her dreams. What excited her most, though, was the idea of the honeymoon, which to her, was a chance to begin their journey as a married couple.

She yearned for a chance to get away with her partner, to bask in the bliss of being newlyweds. She dreamt of romantic sunsets, candlelight dinners, and lazy mornings in bed. Every time she saw a romantic movie or read a romantic novel, she would picture herself in the heroine's place, traveling to exotic locations with her beloved.

Before she even knew who her future husband would be, Sarah had already begun her search for the perfect honeymoon destination. It was on one such routine search that she found a fantastic deal on honeymoon tickets to Bora Bora, a place she'd always dreamed of visiting. She felt a surge of excitement, her heart fluttering at the thought of strolling along its pristine beaches.

Although she had yet to meet the man who would propose to her, Sarah was already planning out their honeymoon. She was sure that her soulmate was out there, waiting to find her just like she was waiting to find him. She didn’t want to let this deal slip away. She wanted to book the honeymoon tickets even before a proposal was on the cards.

She considered it a bold move, perhaps a little unorthodox, but it was such a good deal that she couldn’t resist. So, she took the plunge and purchased the tickets. After all, she reasoned, the dates were flexible.

Sarah's friends found her optimism charming and her confidence infectious. They supported her decision, even though it seemed a little premature. But Sarah knew what she wanted. She believed in the power of her dreams and the strength of her desires. 

A few months later, she met David, a warm-hearted man with an infectious laugh and a kind smile. The connection between them was undeniable, and they quickly fell in love. When David proposed, Sarah cried tears of joy, her heart full. And when she told him about the booked honeymoon tickets to Bora Bora, he laughed and wrapped her in a hug, thrilled at the thought of spending their first days as husband and wife in such a paradise.

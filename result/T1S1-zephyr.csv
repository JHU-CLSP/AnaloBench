Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to ""After working two years for the company she was burned out"" is ""Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do."" Both sentences describe a situation where someone has worked for a long time and then takes a break, but later realizes that they should not have done so because they have a lot of work to do. In the target sentence, the person is ""burned out"" after working for two years, which can be interpreted as feeling exhausted or overwhelmed. In the analogous sentence, Sally is ""burned out"" after relaxing for the weekend, as she has a lot of work to do. Both sentences convey a similar idea of someone working for a long time and then experiencing a negative consequence as a result."

D. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.",C,"D. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence would be:
Better to stick with the foods we are used to, even if they might not be as good as the new ones, than to take the risk of trying the unfamiliar ones that might end up tasting worse.

In both sentences, there is a preference for what is familiar over the unknown, despite the possibility that the unknown might be better. The first sentence is about sweets, while the second sentence is about food in general, but the idea of choosing the familiar over the unknown is present in both.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence would be:
D. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.

In this sentence, there is a preference for maintaining a certain behavior or habit, even if it might not be ideal, over changing it, despite the possibility that the change might be better. This preference for familiarity is similar to the preference for familiar foods in the target sentence.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and the C option express the idea of accepting a situation and making the most of it, rather than waiting for something better to happen. In the target sentence, the speaker suggests building a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up, implying that they are not going to wait for the weather to improve and will instead take action to improve their situation. Similarly, in the C option, the speaker acknowledges that the vacation has come to an end, but instead of dwelling on the fact, they express gratitude for the experience and accept that all good things must come to an end. Both sentences convey a sense of resilience and resourcefulness in the face of adversity."

Note: The answer is D because both sentences involve doing something even if it's not strictly necessary, in order to be prepared for a potential problem. In the target sentence, the speaker is advising someone to continue watering their garden even if rain is forecast, because the rain might not be enough to satisfy the plants' needs. In the analogous sentence, the speaker is bringing a map on a hike even though they're familiar with the area, because they want to be prepared in case they get lost. Both sentences involve doing something extra as a precaution, even if it's not strictly necessary."

D. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.",D,"D.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and the D option suggest making a choice that provides security or comfort over taking a risk.

Similarly, in the D option, the speaker suggests choosing familiar sweets over trying new ones that might not be preferred. Both sentences emphasize the importance of being cautious and avoiding potential negative outcomes."

This is similar to the contrast between the hot cake and the current situation in the target sentence."
40,"It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.","A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

C. Her atheltic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world class athelete.
D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also presents a situation where the initial perception or expectation is not entirely accurate, but the outcome is impressive or successful. In the target sentence, the speaker initially assumes that the weather is too cold to walk, but then reveals that there is a more pressing reason for choosing to drive. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, the speaker initially expects that the person being described is not skilled with a guitar, but then reveals that they are actually quite talented.

D. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.",A,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

Both sentences suggest that one should not push their luck too far, as it may lead to negative consequences. In the target sentence, the speaker advises against being too greedy in negotiations, as the other party may withdraw their offer. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, the speaker suggests that one should not expect too much, as their wild cousin Nathan's behavior often leads to trouble. Both sentences convey the idea that it's better to accept what's offered and avoid taking unnecessary risks.

A, B, and D are not as analogous because they do not convey the same idea of caution and restraint. A suggests making do with what's available, but it does not imply that one should not try to improve their situation. B describes a comeback, which may require some risk-taking. D describes a situation where the speaker is liked for being quiet and obedient, but it does not suggest that one should always be quiet and obedient.

In summary, C is the most analogous sentence because it conveys the same idea of caution and restraint as the target sentence."

C and D do not express a wish or desire, but rather describe a situation or action.

In option A, the speaker describes how the person finished the meal without realizing it, implying that the meal was enjoyable and the person did not want it to end. This is similar to the target sentence, where the speaker enjoyed the TV show and wished it had not ended.

The most analogous sentence to ""After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired."" is ""He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees."" Both sentences describe someone who is focusing on trivial matters and not seeing the bigger picture. In the first sentence, Kate is fixated on getting her boss fired instead of finding a new job or moving on.

Note: The answer is D because both sentences have a similar structure where the subject (John/Ron) has no other responsibilities during a certain time (free time/break) and uses that time to think about a past relationship (ex-girlfriend/previous girlfriend). This is analogous to the target sentence because Ron's lack of responsibilities allows him to come up with detailed and complex pranks, which can be seen as a way of filling his time and using it productively."

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.

This is because both sentences involve a situation where people are making decisions without proper supervision or guidance, leading to negative consequences. In the target sentence, the students created a mess in the absence of a teacher, and in the analogous sentence, Samantha spends all her savings without checking for lower prices. Both situations highlight the importance of making informed decisions and being aware of the potential consequences of our actions.

The other options are not as analogous because they do not involve a lack of supervision or guidance leading to negative consequences. Instead, they involve personal choices or situations that may or may not have negative consequences.

A. Ron comes up with detailed and complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.
B. He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.
C. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.

These options do not involve a lack of supervision or guidance leading to negative consequences. Instead, they involve personal choices or situations that may or may not have negative consequences.

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""You can't pour from an empty cup."" Both sentences express the idea that there is a missed opportunity for a positive outcome due to a lack of action taken earlier. In the target sentence, the missed opportunity is the chance to be cured by the doctor. In the analogous sentence, the missed opportunity is the inability to pour from an empty cup, implying that one cannot take action if they do not have the resources to do so. Both sentences convey a sense of regret for not acting sooner."

Analogous sentence: B. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.

Explanation: Both sentences express a sense of regret and the need to act quickly to avoid missing out on something valuable. The target sentence highlights the missed opportunity to address a problem, while the analogous sentence emphasizes the importance of being proactive in securing the best options. Both sentences convey a sense of urgency and the potential consequences of inaction."

Analogous sentence:
To get the best stuff at the boutique during their sale, we should go early.

(The Early Bird Catches the Worm principle applies here too - the sooner you address the issue, the better the outcome.)"

In the target sentence, submitting courses early increases the chances of getting a seat, and in the analogous sentence, seeking medical treatment earlier increases the chances of being cured. Both sentences also convey a sense of regret for not taking action earlier."

In the target sentence, the presenters rushed to convey a lot of information in a short time, leading to a lack of clarity.

Option A is about starting work without reading requirements and finishing early, which does not relate to maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive actions. Option B is about a father's ultimatum to his son, which does not relate to maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive actions. Option C is about politicians frequently telling lies, which does not relate to maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive actions.

D. Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time.",B,"D.

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

When the tree fell over, there was nothing else we could do.

The options provided are:

A. A fallen tree cannot provide shade.
B. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.
C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.
D. Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time.

In option D, the sentence ""But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time"" is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a situation where something has happened (Liam had to worry about hiding his deception), and there is nothing else that can be done about it, so the person involved (Lary) can enjoy themselves. In the target sentence, Juli's favorite tree has fallen over, and there is nothing else that can be done about it, so her father creates a painting of it. This is similar to Lary's situation in option D, where there is nothing else he has to worry about, so he can enjoy himself.

Therefore, the answer is D."

C. Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence because it involves someone (let's say ""Barry"") advising someone else (""Tim"") to take a different approach after a negative event (""Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team""). In the analogous sentence, ""let's forget what happened"" can be seen as a way of straying away from negative emotions, while ""work on the project together"" can be seen as a way of working hard towards a goal. Both sentences involve advice being given to help someone overcome a setback.

C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
D. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.",A,"A.

Explanation:

The sentence ""The ingcharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery"" is most analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person (the ingcharge) being pleased about a situation (the floor being cleaned properly and no longer slippery) that was caused by another person (the new hire). In both sentences, the main character's happiness is due to someone else's actions.

In contrast, the other options do not involve a similar situation. Option B describes a person's anticipation for an event, but it does not involve someone else's actions causing the person's happiness. Option C describes a negative situation (the cables being snapped) and does not involve happiness. Option D is a statement of fact and does not involve happiness or actions by others.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""The ingcharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery"" (A)."
170,"Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.","A. The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves.

D. The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.",B,"C.

Explanation:

The sentence ""She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?"" is the most analogous to the target sentence because it also highlights a significant advantage that the speaker possesses, which others are unaware of. In the target sentence, the speaker's opponents are unaware of their greatest asset, which is their stamina. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, the other person(s) should recognize the speaker because she is a representative of California, but they do not. Both sentences convey the idea that the speaker has an advantage that others do not know about, making them superior in some way."

Most analogous sentence:
C. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
Both sentences express a situation where something cannot be done or achieved due to a lack of a necessary condition. In the first sentence, the employee cannot be dismissed because she has information that could harm the boss's reputation. In the second sentence, writing cannot be done with an inkless pen, as the pen is a necessary tool for writing. Both sentences convey the idea that a necessary condition is missing, preventing the desired action from taking place."

In the target sentence, there is a change in the relationship between the speaker and Nick, from one of forgiveness to one of anger, following an insult. In D, there is a change in the weather, from stormy to pleasant, following a period of discomfort or difficulty."

D. Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.",C,"C. I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In this case, the speaker is holding a grudge against the person for not treating them with respect."
182,Karen is upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.

C. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.
D. While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.",D,"D.

Note: The answer is D because Peter's successful escape from the secret police is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as both describe a situation where the outcome is unexpected and close to failure. Lester making the dance team by the skin of his teeth is similar to Peter's successful escape as both were close to failure, with Lester almost missing the cutoff for the dance team and Peter being believed to be impossible to escape from the secret police. The other options do not have the same level of closeness to failure as the target sentence."
185,"While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.","A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

C. The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.
D. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.",A,"A.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a situation where the outcome is achieved by a small margin. In the target sentence, the speaker made the final cut to the university by a small margin. In option A, the group finished the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline. Both sentences convey the idea that the outcome could have been different if the margin was not small. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
188,He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.,"A. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.
B. Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth since the audition was about to be closed.

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",B,"B. Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth since the audition was about to be closed.

The closest in meaning to the target sentence is B because it also involves a close call or narrow escape, as Lester made the dance team by a small margin since the audition was about to end. This is similar to how the person in the target sentence narrowly avoided falling off the cliff and being saved just in time."

C. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
D. He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.",C,"C.

Note: The answer is C because it involves a close outcome, where the group finished the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline. This is analogous to the target sentence where Philly won the game but the opponent came close to victory.

In the options, A and B do not involve a close outcome, and D is not analogous as it involves a different context."

C. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
D. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.",A,"A.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and option A involve describing a challenging task that requires a significant amount of effort and dedication. In the target sentence, losing weight is presented as easier said than done, implying that it is a difficult task that requires commitment. Similarly, in option A, teaching a class can be daunting for a first-timer, and it requires a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.

C. My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.
D. You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.

Explanation:

In Sally's case, she has a fear of lifting weights, but she wants to overcome it and start going to the gym.

Both individuals have a fear, but they want to overcome it and take action.

The other options do not have a similar situation where the individual has a fear but wants to overcome it. In B, it's a cause-and-effect statement, and in C, it's a statement about the dog's current state. In D, it's a statement about relieving stress, but it doesn't involve overcoming a fear.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Answer: B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Note: Only generate a letter from [A, B, C, D] without any additional text.

Explanation:

B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also describes a person making a significant change in their life. The target sentence talks about a person getting bored and tired of her job and deciding to leave and open a restaurant. The analogous sentence talks about a person (Alex) getting tired of struggling and deciding to enjoy his life by spending his newly earned money on drinks and parties. Both sentences describe a person making a significant change in their life based on their current situation.

The other options are not as analogous because they describe different situations. A describes a baby's comfort level, C describes a natural disaster, and D describes a person's focus on a project. None of these situations are directly related to making a significant change in one's life, as described in the target sentence and the analogous sentence."
205,She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.,"A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.

C. Sam is scared of speaking to strangers but she wants to build up the courage and try it out.

Note: The answer is D because both the target sentence and the selected sentence involve a significant change in career or lifestyle choices.

In the selected sentence, Smith quits his job as a lawyer to pursue a career in singing on YouTube. Both sentences demonstrate a shift in direction or focus in the individuals' lives."

After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",D,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also describes a person making a significant change in their life and pursuing a new path after a long period of working in a different field. However, in D, the person is quitting their job as a lawyer and starting a youtube channel for singing, whereas in the target sentence, Alex is switching from struggling to earning money and spending it on partying and drinking. Both sentences depict a significant change in the person's life and the reasons behind it."

Analogous sentence:
The prisoner felt as snug as a bug in a rug while hiding in the dark corner of the cell, away from the guards' watchful eyes.

Note: The answer is not necessarily a perfect match, but it should convey a similar meaning or feeling as the target sentence.

In this case, both the target sentence and the analogous sentence describe a situation where someone feels safe and secure, hidden away from potential danger or threats. The baby in the target sentence is snug next to her mother, while the prisoner in the analogous sentence feels snug while hiding from the guards. Both situations convey a sense of comfort and safety."

Analogous sentence: D. She cannot be dismissed because she is aware of the boss's shady business dealings.

Both sentences involve a person's actions or knowledge leading to a certain outcome. In the target sentence, the dog's behavior leads to it being more frequently near Sally's father. In the analogous sentence, the person's knowledge prevents dismissal. In the other options, the first sentence describes a personal preference, the second sentence describes a situation where someone is called to speak about their actions, and the third sentence describes a person seeking advice."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:
D. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and the analogous sentence describe a situation where someone is focusing too much on a small detail and ignoring the bigger picture. In the target sentence, the congressman becomes too involved in the wording of his bill and fails to realize that it cannot pass. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, someone is obsessing over a single doorknob while the entire house is being renovated, indicating that they are not seeing the larger picture."

D. The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.",D,"D.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and the D option describe a situation where the focus on something other than the intended task leads to an undesirable outcome. In the target sentence, the focus on the peculiar grammar and word choice distracts the speaker from learning anything from the book. Similarly, in the D option, the congressman becomes so involved in the wording of his bill that he fails to realize that the bill cannot pass. Both sentences highlight the importance of staying focused on the task at hand to achieve the desired outcome."
218,He is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.,"A. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.

Both sentences convey the idea of prioritizing a goal over other aspects, such as learning from the past or enjoying the present. In the first sentence, the destination is prioritized over the journey, and in the second sentence, the project is prioritized over past events."

D. He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.",D,"B. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.

Analogous sentence:

(C) Don't you know he is the president of the United States?! is not analogous as it is a statement, not a sentence. (D) He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer is not analogous as it is not related to learning or gaining knowledge. (A) Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else is not analogous as it is not related to learning or gaining knowledge.

In the given options, the sentence that comes closest to this is:
Listen to the news straight from the horse’s mouth, his factory burned down right in front of his eyes.

Here, the phrase ""straight from the horse's mouth"" is used to mean that the news is being reported directly by the person involved, in this case, the person whose factory has burned down. This is similar to the target sentence, where the serial killer is being called upon to speak directly about his crimes on national television.

Therefore, the answer would be B."

D. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.",B,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

In both sentences, the speaker is presenting an alternative option for someone who may not be comfortable with the usual or more complex choices. The chef offers a simpler dish for less adventurous customers, and Frank finds comfort in the familiarity of his childhood bed after being away from home for a long time. Both sentences highlight the idea of catering to individual preferences or needs.

The other options do not have a similar context. A and B describe situations where something less desirable is being replaced by a better alternative, but the target sentence and C are about offering choices that suit specific preferences. D is about seeking advice, but it does not involve presenting alternative options.

Therefore, C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

C. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.
D. Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine.",A,"A.

Explanation:

The sentence ""The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks."" is most analogous to the target sentence because it also describes a situation where someone requests that they not be disturbed for important work. In the target sentence, Tom asks not to be disturbed by meeting with anyone when he has an important event to plan for. In the analogous sentence, the doctor asks the staff not to interrupt him with minor tasks because he has an important surgery the next day. Both situations involve someone requesting that they not be disturbed for important work.

Explanation:

The sentence ""The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks."" can be compared to ""Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry."" because both sentences convey a request to not be disturbed due to the importance of a task at hand. In the first sentence, the doctor has an important surgery the next day, and he asks the staff not to interrupt him with minor tasks. Similarly, in the second sentence, the speaker requests not to be disturbed with any calls as they have bigger tasks to attend to."

D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",C,"D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.

Explanation:

In this analogy, the target sentence is about the consequences of not completing a task (homework) on time. The sentence explains that Amy made up a false excuse (dog ate it) to avoid the penalty, but the professor did not accept it and penalized her.

The closest analogy to this scenario is the sentence ""You can't drive a car with no fuel."" This sentence explains the consequence of not having a necessary resource (fuel) for completing a task (driving a car). Just as Amy's false excuse did not prevent the penalty, running out of fuel will not allow a car to be driven. Both sentences illustrate the importance of completing tasks on time and having necessary resources to avoid negative consequences."

This is similar to the target sentence, where a clerical error in chemistry grades is being corrected. Both sentences involve a correction or clarification of a previous situation."

D. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.",A,"D is not analogous to the target sentence.

A is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not related to a party or being allowed in a place.

C is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not related to being banned or on a list.

B is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not related to being invited or allowed into a party.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

E. I regret to inform you that your name has been removed from the guest list for the event. You are no longer invited.

However, since we are only asked to generate a letter from [A, B, C, D], the answer would be:

So, the answer is:

B is not the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.",C,"D.

Explanation:

In all the given options, the sentence ""I do not want to spoil your mood but I have to babysit my nephew today"" is replaced by a sentence that conveys a similar situation where the speaker has to do something that might affect the mood of the other person but they don't want to spoil it.

Option A: Here, the speaker is asking the other person to share their experience of watching a movie instead of sharing it themselves. This doesn't affect the mood of the other person, so it's not a suitable option.

Option B: In this option, the speaker wants to prepare the nursery before knowing the decision of the adoption agency. This doesn't affect the mood of the other person, so it's not a suitable option.

Option C: Here, the speaker is asking the other person to present their work before going on vacation. This might affect the mood of the other person, but the speaker is trying to avoid spoiling it by saying ""I'm sorry"". This is a suitable option.

Option D: In this option, the speaker is asking the staff not to interrupt him with minor tasks as he has an important surgery the next day. This might affect the mood of the staff, but the speaker is trying to avoid spoiling it by saying ""I asked"". This is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

This is similar to the target sentence, where the speaker is surprised that the person being described is not recognized as a representative of California. In option B, the person being described is a highly respected figure in the music industry, and the speaker is surprised that others do not recognize them as a winner of multiple Grammy awards and a prominent figure in the rap genre."

In this case, the most analogous sentence is D. Both sentences involve knowing something about a person's behavior or character but choosing to tolerate it for some reason. In the target sentence, the speaker knows that Rick is only after money and is not a good friend, but still decides to get along with him for the time being. In the analogous sentence, the speaker knows that the friend is not doing her homework and is going to the spa instead, but this does not mean that the speaker can also skip her homework. Both sentences involve recognizing a behavior that is not ideal but choosing to tolerate it for some reason."
260,"The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.","A. She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.
B. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.
C. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him.
D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"A.

Explanation:

Both sentences involve a situation where the subject knows something is wrong but chooses not to act on it. In the target sentence, the professor knows that the students copied the homework but decides not to be strict about it. In option A, the subject knows the person is lying but chooses to turn a blind eye to the situation. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
261,"Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.","A. She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.
B. The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.
C. He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.
D. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.",C,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it involves a close call or near-miss situation where the outcome could have been disastrous, but the person involved manages to avoid it at the last moment. In the target sentence, Lisa's book could have been lost or damaged if Mark had not returned it, but she chooses to overlook the issue for some reason."
262,"She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","A. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.
B. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.
C. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
D. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.",A,"D.

Note: The answer is D because it highlights the importance of taking action instead of just talking about it, which is similar to the idea presented in the target sentence. The other options do not have a clear analogy to the target sentence."
263,"He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.","A. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.
B. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.
C. Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.
D. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.",B,"Caring towards her everytime he met her, although he never told her about his feelings, is most analogous to Monica cooking so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday, although she didn't mention it to anyone. (A) is not analogous as it suggests continuing an action despite contrary conditions. (B) is not analogous as it suggests a contrast between words and actions. (D) is not analogous as it is a statement of fact, not an action or behavior."
264,She posted a lot about her friendship with Mary on Instagram. But in reality they hardly had any bond as they were constantly on their phones when together.,"A. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.
B. You can't drive a car with no fuel.
C. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also involves unspoken feelings and actions that are not immediately apparent. However, the target sentence focuses on a friendship that is not as strong as it appears on social media, while the analogous sentence is about unrequited feelings. Both sentences highlight the discrepancy between external appearances and internal realities."
265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","A. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.
B. Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.
C. The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.
D. You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.",A,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it highlights the importance of making the most of current opportunities before they are gone, much like how the person in the target sentence showcased his guitar skills despite initially speaking poorly about them. The other options do not have a similar theme of initial doubt or criticism followed by a positive outcome."
266,Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.,"A. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.
B. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.
C. I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.
D. All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,"D.

Analogous sentence:
The paintings in the gallery were all stunning, but the last one left a sour taste in my mouth.

Note: The answer is D, as both sentences describe a positive impression followed by a negative one. In the target sentence, Garry's ability to manage work stress is presented positively, but his constant smoking habit contradicts this impression. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, all the paintings in the gallery are described as stunning, but the last one leaves a negative impression."
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.

C. Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"D.

Letter: D."
269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"A. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.
D. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.",D,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also involves a group of people (many students) coming together for a specific purpose (to study under a guru). In contrast, A describes Sally's personal experience of providing support to her parents, B describes an attack on an argument, and D describes Andy's action of opening blinds to see the sunrise."
270,"John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.","A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
B. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.

D. When Juli's favorite tree had fallen over, her father created a painting of it and said there was nothing else they could do.",B,"C. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.

Analogous sentence:

B. I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.
C. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",A,"A.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a significant change or growth over time. In the target sentence, Mary's collection of books transformed into a library. In the analogous sentence, a suburban community expanded into a sizeable settlement. Both sentences illustrate how time and accumulation can lead to a significant transformation.

C, D, and B do not accurately represent the same transformation as the target sentence. C describes a situation where someone else can provide details, but it does not depict a transformation or growth over time. B describes a situation where the speaker did not have enough resources to do something they wanted, but it does not depict a significant transformation or growth over time.

Therefore, A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
272,Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.,"A. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
B. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.
C. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.
D. Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.",A,"D.

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.

In both sentences, there is a sudden change in the environment or situation due to an action taken by the subject. In the target sentence, Andy's action of opening the window blinds leads to the sudden change of the dark room being brightly lit. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, Monica's action of cooking a lot of food leads to the sudden change of her needing to take a leave to rest. Both sentences show a cause-effect relationship between the subject's action and the resulting change."
273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"A. A forest grew near the river.
B. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.
C. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",A,"A. A new town has sprung up on the outskirts of the city over the past few decades. (most analogous)

B. She appeared cheerful in the morning despite crying all night.
C. The supervisor was delighted to find that the floor was no longer slippery due to the new employee's thorough cleaning.
D. With half of their soldiers gone, they were forced to use the tank in battle.

Letter: A."

B. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.",D,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also uses a hypothetical scenario to illustrate a missed opportunity or consequence. In this case, if she had brought the chicken, we would have missed out on the delicious pasta. The target sentence also uses a hypothetical scenario to illustrate a potential danger or consequence, as each blade of grass could have been seen as a potential injury if stepped on. Both sentences use strong imagery to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind."
275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"A. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
B. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.
C. You can't write from an inkless pen.
D. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.",B,"C. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Analogous sentence:
Every time you use an inkless pen to write, it poses a threat to your ability to communicate effectively.

Note: The analogous sentence is not required, but it helps to understand the relationship between the target sentence and the options. The analogous sentence for option C highlights the fact that an inkless pen is useless for writing, just as cigarettes are useless for promoting health."
276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"A. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.
C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.",B,"B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also involves an action being taken on a specific object. In this case, the hammer is being used to attack the nail, much like how the person in the target sentence is attacking the points in the argument.

Answer: B.

Note: The other options do not involve an action being taken on a specific object in the same way as the target sentence. A involves choosing between two options, C involves giving advice, and D involves describing an action's aftermath."
277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.
C. She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.
D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",A,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.

Note: The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""A succession of waves battered the rock."" Both sentences describe the impact of strong forces on structures or objects. In the target sentence, strong winds snap cables supporting a cellphone tower, and in the analogous sentence, waves batter a rock. Both sentences convey the idea of external forces causing damage or destruction to something that is not capable of withstanding them."
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.
B. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
C. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.
D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",C,"C. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.

Most analogous sentence:
D. The engineers kept hammering away at the broken machine until it finally worked.

Explanation:
Both sentences describe a persistent action that continues until a desired outcome is achieved. In the target sentence, the waves continue to hit the rock until it is affected. In the analogous sentence, the engineers continue to work on the machine until it is fixed.

Alternative analogous sentence:
C. The company poured more and more resources into the project until it was successful.

Explanation:
Both sentences describe a gradual increase in effort or investment until a desired outcome is achieved. In the target sentence, the waves continue to hit the rock until it is affected. In the analogous sentence, the company continues to invest resources into the project until it is successful."
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"A. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.
D. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.",B,"D does not accurately describe a string of unfortunate events plaguing a production. The closest option would be C, as it describes a series of negative events being overcome by hard work and dedication. However, A is also a possibility, as it describes a situation where the speaker's initial performance was poor, but their hard work and talent ultimately shone through. In either case, the key is that the negative events were eventually overcome through hard work and dedication.

Letter: C"
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"A. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.
B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.",D,"D is not analogous to the target sentence.

A is not analogous to the target sentence because it is a personal anecdote about Larry and his sister, whereas the target sentence is about a macroeconomic concept.

B is not analogous to the target sentence because it is about the success of a politician, whereas the target sentence is about the causes of an economic depression.

C is not analogous to the target sentence because it is a statement of fact about the president, whereas the target sentence is about the causes of an economic depression.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

The natural disaster was the combined result of several environmental factors.

However, since we are only asked to generate a letter, the answer is:

A is not analogous to the target sentence.
B is not analogous to the target sentence.
C is not analogous to the target sentence.
D is not analogous to the target sentence.

Answer:

[ ] A
[ ] B
[ ] C
[ ] D

Note: Only one letter should be selected."
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.",A,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a situation where something unexpected or unplanned happened, and additional efforts or resources were required to fix the problem. In the target sentence, the corporation had to keep adding more money to fix the problem, and in the analogous sentence, the birthday party guests didn't get to taste the planned chicken dish, but instead enjoyed the unexpected pasta. Both sentences highlight the need for extra resources or efforts to overcome an unanticipated issue.

Note: The answer is based on the given options, and there might be other analogous sentences that could be found in other contexts."
282,He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.,"A. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.
B. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
C. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.
D. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.",B,"C.

Note: The most analogous sentence would have a similar structure and relationship between the subject, action, and object as the target sentence. In this case, C has a clear cause-effect relationship between the weather and the stormy week, which is similar to the cause-effect relationship between the subject (he) and the action (knocked) in the target sentence."
283,Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.,"A. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.
D. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.",A,"C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.

Analogous sentence:

Letter: C."
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"A. Lets meet him and ask about the robbery. Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear.
B. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",D,"D. You can't love with a broken heart. (analogous)

Note: The other options do not have a direct correlation to the target sentence in terms of expressing a difficulty or impossibility in performing an action due to a specific condition."
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.
B. Sachin is said to be the best cricketer in the world, but like every other player, he had to retire.
C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"D.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and the analogous sentence (D) express the idea that something that is broken or damaged is no longer functional or useful for its intended purpose. In the target sentence, a broken cup cannot hold coffee, and in the analogous sentence, one cannot eat from a broken plate. Both sentences convey the idea that a damaged object is no longer able to serve its intended purpose."
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
C. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"D. one can't eat from a broken plate.

The most analogous sentence to ""You can't pour from an empty cup."" is ""one can't eat from a broken plate."" Both sentences convey the idea that you cannot use something that is not functional or has been damaged to fulfill a basic need. In the case of ""You can't pour from an empty cup,"" it means that you cannot draw anything from a container that is empty, and in the case of ""one can't eat from a broken plate,"" it means that you cannot eat from a plate that is broken and cannot hold food."
287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"A. The A team is the best one as it has the best players except Ron, who often negates the others' efforts.
B. one can't eat from a broken plate.
C. I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive.
D. If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.",B,"B. The most analogous sentence to ""A fallen tree cannot provide shade"" is ""one can't eat from a broken plate."" Both sentences convey the idea that something that is no longer in its intended state or position cannot serve its intended purpose. In the first sentence, a fallen tree cannot provide shade because it is no longer standing upright. In the second sentence, a broken plate cannot be used to eat from because it is no longer intact."
288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.
B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.
D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,A. No liquid can be held by a shattered cup.
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"A. He attacked every point in my argument.
B. It's hard to love with a broken heart.
C. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",B,"B.

Note: The most analogous sentence to ""You can't write from an inkless pen"" is ""It's hard to paint with an empty paintbrush"" or ""It's difficult to play music with a broken instrument"". However, since we are only asked to generate a letter, we will choose the most similar option from the given choices, which is ""B"".

In this case, ""B"" is the most analogous sentence because it also involves an inability to perform an action due to a lack of a necessary resource, which is similar to the situation in ""You can't write from an inkless pen"". In ""B"", the lack of a functioning heart makes it difficult to love, just as the lack of ink makes it difficult to write in ""A"".

However, it's worth mentioning that ""C"" is also somewhat analogous because it involves an obstacle that makes it difficult to perform an action, but in this case, the obstacle is not a lack of a resource, but rather a physical threat. Nonetheless, ""B"" is still the most similar to ""You can't write from an inkless pen"" in terms of the lack of a necessary resource."
290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",B,"B. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Analogous sentence:
C. You can't draw with a pen that has run out of ink.

Note: The answer is B because it shares the same structure and meaning as the target sentence. Both sentences state that a specific action cannot be performed without a necessary component. In this case, driving a car requires fuel, and writing requires ink (or another writing medium). The analogous sentence for B would be C, as it also involves an action that requires a specific component (ink) to be performed.

D is not analogous because it describes a change in career, not the inability to perform an action due to a lack of a necessary component. A and C are not analogous because they do not involve the inability to perform an action due to a lack of a necessary component."
291,one can't eat from a broken plate.,"A. You can't write from an inkless pen.
B. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.
C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
D. He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees.",A,A. You can't write from an inkless pen.
292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
B. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.
D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.",A,"B. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.

The most analogous sentence to ""The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe."" would be ""As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke."" Both sentences describe a process where something is being transferred or moved from one place to another through a narrow or constricted path. In the first sentence, water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe, and in the second sentence, smoke is left behind as a flame extinguishes. Both sentences illustrate a transfer of something from one place to another through a narrow or constricted path. Therefore, B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.
B. He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.
C. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.
D. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.",A,"A.

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe."" Both sentences describe a flow of liquid from one body of water to another, with Lake Erie being the larger body and Lake Ontario being the smaller one, and the Niagara River serving as the narrow pipe through which the water flows. This analogy helps to illustrate the concept of drainage and the flow of water from one body to another.

The other options do not accurately represent the relationship between Lake Erie, the Niagara River, and Lake Ontario. Option B describes a person being called to talk about his crimes, which has no relation to the flow of water. Option C describes a TV show ending, which is not related to the flow of water. Option D describes saving money, which is not related to the flow of water. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
294,The parent tries to instill bits of knowledge in their child by simple communication.,"A. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.
B. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.
C. When Chris turned forty, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job for his hobbies.
D. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.",B,B. B.
295,"Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.","A. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.
B. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.
C. Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.
D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.",C,"D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.

Explanation:

The target sentence describes a gradual process (little by little) that leads to a specific outcome (melted chocolate). The most analogous sentence would also describe a gradual process that leads to a specific outcome. In this case, the sentence ""It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one"" describes a gradual process (applying to multiple companies) that leads to a specific outcome (increased job opportunities). Therefore, this sentence is the most analogous to the target sentence."
296,Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.,"A. Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.

This is similar to the situation in the analogous sentence, ""The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other,"" where after the war ended, the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other. In both cases, there is a relationship between two entities (state budget and federal government's spending package, war and countries) where one is being influenced by the other."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it involves a clear statement of consequences by a person in authority. In the target sentence, the management makes it clear that employees must be on board with new policies or they will be let go. In the analogous sentence, the wife makes it clear that the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

In the target sentence, the lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves, which implies that they interacted with each other during the seminar and possibly after it as well.

Both sentences describe groups of people who interact with each other regularly."

The phrase ""birds of a feather flock together"" is a common expression that highlights the idea of people with similar interests being drawn to each other. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Both sentences highlight the impact of an exception or weakness on the overall performance or strength of the group."

Explanation:

Both target sentence and D follow the cause-effect pattern. In the target sentence, not going to sleep early causes waking up late, and in D, not trusting just one childcare method causes a well-rounded upbringing. Both sentences illustrate that there is a direct relationship between the cause and effect.

A, B, and C do not follow the cause-effect pattern. In A, the speaker is stating a fact about someone's opponent, and there is no cause-effect relationship. In B, the sentence is describing where part of the budget comes from, and there is no cause-effect relationship. In C, the sentence is describing someone's actions and the speaker's reaction, but there is no cause-effect relationship.

So, D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence in terms of cause-effect relationship."

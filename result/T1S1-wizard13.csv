B. They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back.
C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. A fallen tree cannot provide shade.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""All that glitters is not gold"" is ""A fallen tree cannot provide shade.""

This is because both sentences convey a similar message about appearances being deceiving. The target sentence warns that just because something appears to be valuable or attractive (glitters), it doesn't necessarily mean it is of high quality (gold). Similarly, a fallen tree, which may seem to provide shade due to its size and position, is in fact unable to do so because it is no longer standing. Both sentences remind us to look beyond appearances and consider the underlying reality or substance."

Step 3: Choose the most analogous letter based on the comparison.

Since the target sentence has a neutral tone and is about changing perceptions based on new information, the most analogous letter is C, which also has a neutral tone and is about changing perceptions based on new information.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.

The target sentence expresses a feeling of envy and a sense of longing for something that seems better than one's current situation. It also acknowledges that the grass may appear greener on the other side but in reality, it may not be so.

Option C captures this sentiment by stating that something may seem appealing or enjoyable from a distance, but in reality, it can be challenging and difficult. It also encourages the person to appreciate what they have, which aligns with the theme of counting one's blessings in the target sentence.

Option A talks about the silver lining in every situation, which is a different concept. Option B discusses someone's financial situation, which is not related to the target sentence. Option D talks about how a challenging experience (joining a debate club) led to a positive outcome (becoming a persuasive speaker), which is not the same as the target sentence's theme of envying someone else's situation."

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a person who left one profession to pursue another, thinking it would be better, but ended up struggling. The most analogous sentence from the given options is D. The journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like. This sentence also talks about a person who had a certain perception about someone else's life, only to find out that it was not as great as they thought."

D. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.

Just like John in the target sentence, the person in option C is initially perceived as lacking in a certain area (in this case, guitar skills). However, despite this initial perception, their true abilities and efforts are revealed when they demonstrate their skills (playing the guitar). Similarly, John's wealth is evident to everyone, but his loneliness is a hidden aspect of his life that only those close to him can understand."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was ruined. He realized that he should have had other backup plans.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a situation where something appears to be enjoyable or easy, but in reality, it is a struggle or a difficult situation. The person in this sentence was relying heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was left in a difficult situation. This is similar to the target sentence where moving to a different country may seem fun, but in reality, it is a struggle. Both sentences also include a lesson or advice, encouraging the reader to consider other options or be prepared for potential difficulties."
16,"The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.","A. Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.

In the analogous sentence, the destination (reaching the destination) represents the appearance of success or achievement, and the journey (experiencing the journey) represents the reality of the process or struggles."

D. Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

This sentence is analogous because it describes a transformation or change from one state to another, just like the target sentence describes a change from a state of rage to a state of calmness. In the target sentence, the person lets off his rage and sits down like a lamb, which is a significant change in behavior. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which is a significant change in physical activity."

B. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
C. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.
D. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a sequence of events where a gust of wind shakes down the shacks and then a soft breeze follows. The sentence implies a contrast between the harshness of the gust of wind and the gentleness of the soft breeze.

Option A is the most analogous because it also describes a contrast between two states of a single object. In this case, a broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, implying that the cup was once functional but is now damaged and cannot perform its intended purpose. This contrast is similar to the contrast in the target sentence between the gust of wind and the soft breeze.

Option B describes a gradual process of melting, which is different from the sudden event of a gust of wind shaking down the shacks.

Option C involves a request for an item and the response with an old, rusty item, which does not have a contrasting sequence of events.

Option D describes a person collapsing after running a marathon, which is not related to the contrasting sequence of events in the target sentence."

C. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
D. Their company is so debt-ridden due to erratic management that I think it's safe to say they're about to go bankrupt.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.

The target sentence describes the extinguishing of a flame and the resulting thin wisp of smoke. Similarly, option A allows Sam to share her own experience of watching a movie, just as the flame extinguishes and leaves behind a thin wisp of smoke."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

The target sentence describes a situation where the dog is exhausted after playing with a frisbee. Similarly, option D talks about a situation where the speaker is taking precautions (going by car) despite the weather not being extremely cold, to avoid getting sick. Both sentences describe situations where the speaker is taking a precautionary measure to avoid a negative outcome, which is the main similarity between them."
25,Their company is so debt-ridden due to erratic management that I think it's safe to say they're about to go bankrupt.,"A. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.
B. We missed the bus, but it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk.
C. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.
D. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about a company's financial situation and its potential bankruptcy due to poor management. It describes the current state of the company and predicts a possible future outcome.

Option A is the most analogous because it also talks about a goal (reaching a destination) and the process to achieve it (forgetting the journey). However, it does not directly mention any negative consequences or outcomes. Instead, it focuses on the balance between the two.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a situation where Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight. Similarly, option A talks about a friend who has immersed herself in a day-long activity (painting marathon) and is now completely drained, refusing to get up for several minutes. Both sentences convey a situation where an individual is exhausted from an activity and needs time to recover."

C. On his last birthday, Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight.
D. Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a person (Ally) who has been working extensively and is now taking a break to rest due to sickness. Similarly, the sentence A talks about a person (Nathan) who is the opposite of the target person in terms of behavior. Nathan is wild and always gets into trouble, while the target person is quiet and obedient. Both sentences highlight the contrast between two individuals, making A the most analogous choice.

Option B talks about a person who enjoys talking to others about a specific topic (computers), which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C describes a person (Mike's friend) who consumed too much alcohol and passed out, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about a person (Sally) who is afraid of going to the gym but has recently shown interest in starting, which is not related to the target sentence as it does not describe a contrast between two individuals."

B. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.
C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.
D. A succession of waves battered the rock.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a person who has engaged in an intense activity (a painting marathon) and has become exhausted as a result. The most analogous sentence among the given options is the one that describes a similar situation where a person has engaged in a strenuous activity and has become drained.

Option A is not analogous because it describes a celebratory event (a graduation) and does not involve physical exhaustion.

Option B is not analogous because it describes a political situation involving a secret plan and a scandal, which is quite different from the theme of physical exhaustion.

Option D is not analogous because it describes waves battering a rock, which is a completely different scenario that does not involve a person's physical state or activity."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Monica cooking a lot of food and then taking a leave to rest. Similarly, in option A, Philip avoids doing chores by pretending to be busy and is eventually made to do them all week. Both sentences involve a person doing a lot of work (cooking or doing chores) and then having to take a break or face consequences."

B. My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence: 
- Subject: She
- Action: was burned out
- Time: after working two years for the company

Step 2: Analyze the options:
- A: The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees.
- B: My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.
- C: Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.
- D: Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not the right choice as she had a lot of work to do.

Step 3: Compare the options with the target sentence:
- A: The company's apology is not related to the subject's state of being burned out.
- B: The dog's state of being down is not related to the subject's state of being burned out.
- C: The advice to keep water nearby is not related to the subject's state of being burned out.
- D: Sally's choice to relax is not related to the subject's state of being burned out.

Step 4: Select the most analogous option:

D. Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a person who engaged in a strenuous activity (running a marathon) and as a result, experienced exhaustion and collapsed. 

Option B also describes a person who engaged in a long, intense activity (a day-long painting marathon) and experienced exhaustion to the point of being unable to get up for several minutes. This is similar to the target sentence in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship between the activity and the resulting exhaustion. 

The other options do not share this similarity. Option A talks about people socializing at a conference, which is not related to exhaustion or physical activity. Option C describes a person who rushed to finish papers but had to redo them due to complaints, which does not involve physical exhaustion. Option D talks about a dog's behavior, which is not related to human physical activity or exhaustion."

Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence is a piece of advice, urging someone not to give up hope and quit their job, despite not liking it, in the hope of finding a better one. It emphasizes the importance of patience and perseverance.

Step 2: Analyze each option

A. This sentence talks about a person's financial situation and their decision to eat leftover food instead of going out for dinner. It doesn't have any relation to the target sentence's theme of perseverance and hope.

B. This sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards someone and holds them accountable for not showing respect. It doesn't have any relation to the target sentence's theme of hope and perseverance.

C. This sentence talks about a person's familiarity with a place and their decision to bring a map as a precautionary measure. It doesn't have any relation to the target sentence's theme of hope and perseverance.

D. This sentence talks about people's lack of understanding towards mathematics and the speaker's personal appreciation for the subject. It doesn't have any relation to the target sentence's theme of hope and perseverance.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous sentence
Out of all the options, option D is the most analogous to the target sentence. It talks about people's lack of understanding towards a subject (mathematics) and the speaker's personal appreciation for it, which is similar to the target sentence's theme of understanding and appreciation.

Answer: D"

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a person who left something (his partner) to find something else (true love), only to realize that he already had it before. This is similar to the situation in option D, where the politician left (or planned) something (his secret plan) to achieve something else (winning the election), only to realize that he already had it (a scandalous secret about his opponent). Both sentences involve a person leaving or planning to leave something to achieve something else, only to find out that they already had it."

C. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.
D. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.",C,"
Step 1: Understand the context of the target sentence.
The target sentence is about preferring familiar things over new ones.

Step 2: Analyze each option.

A. This sentence is about a friend selling his house due to financial issues. It has nothing to do with the context of the target sentence.

B. This sentence is about a group managing to finish a project and submitting it on time. It is not related to the context of the target sentence.

C. This sentence is about choosing to go by car because the person can't afford to get sick. It is somewhat related to the context of the target sentence as it also involves making a choice based on a reason.

D. This sentence is about not doing something just because someone else doesn't do it. It is not related to the context of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous sentence.

Out of the given options, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is C. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick. This sentence also involves making a choice based on a reason, which is similar to the context of the target sentence."
35,I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.,"A. Mary often boasted of her rose garden to be the best garden in the city. But in reality it is nothing but ordinary.
B. You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate. Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic.
C. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.
D. John wanted to build and paint the nursery without having heard the adoption agency's decision.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences express a preference for a certain action despite the circumstances not being ideal. In the target sentence, the speaker prefers to use their old pan for cooking instead of buying a new one with fancy features. In the analogous sentence, the speaker chooses to go by car despite the weather not being extremely cold, because they cannot afford to get sick. Both sentences show a preference for a certain option over another, despite the presence of other factors that might influence the decision."
36,Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.,"A. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is about making the best of a situation (the cold weather) and taking action (building a fire) instead of waiting for conditions to improve. This is similar to the situation in option A, where the person (Mike) has experienced something (an incident) and can provide details about it, so it's best to let him share his experience rather than waiting for others to tell you about it. Both sentences involve taking action or making the most of what's available, rather than waiting for conditions to change."
37,"Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.","A. It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.
B. He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.

D. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

Explanation:

The target sentence is giving advice to continue watering the garden despite the forecast of rain. It's saying that the action (watering) should continue regardless of the situation (rain).

Option A is not analogous because it's talking about doing a bad thing, which is the opposite of the target sentence's advice to continue watering.

Option B is not analogous because it's about someone trying to avoid a situation (paying taxes) and now facing consequences for it, which is different from the target sentence's advice to continue watering despite a forecast.

Option C is not analogous because it's about wishing for something that didn't happen, which is different from the target sentence's advice to continue watering despite a forecast.

Option D is analogous because it's about continuing an action (hiking) despite being familiar with the area and not needing a map, which is similar to the target sentence's advice to continue watering despite a forecast of rain."
38,"Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.","A. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

C. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.
D. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.",D,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence is a piece of advice given to someone, suggesting that they should take an umbrella as a precautionary measure, even though it is currently sunny.

Step 2: Analyze the options
We have four options to choose from. Let's analyze each one:

A. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.
This sentence is about the speaker's preference for conversing with people who are knowledgeable about computers and their interest in learning more about the subject. It doesn't relate to the target sentence's context or advice.

B. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.
This sentence talks about the speaker's effort to send a letter after a delay of two weeks, but it doesn't have any connection to the target sentence's advice or context.

C. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.
This sentence is about the speaker's personality and their cousin's behavior, which is unrelated to the target sentence's advice or context.

D. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.
This sentence is about preferring familiar sweets over trying new ones, which doesn't relate to the target sentence's advice or context.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous sentence
Out of all the options, the sentence that is most analogous to the target sentence is option D. Like the target sentence, option D is also giving advice, suggesting that it's better to stick with what you know than to take a risk on something new.

Answer: D"
39,"To avoid burning your hands, use oven mitts when removing the cake, as it will be hot unlike how it is now.","A. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

C. Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around.
D. They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it uses a similar structure and conveys a similar meaning. The target sentence advises someone to use oven mitts to avoid getting burned, while the given sentence advises someone to take precautions (using a car) to avoid getting sick, even though it is not that cold outside. Both sentences emphasize the importance of taking preventive measures to avoid potential harm or discomfort."
40,"It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.","A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

C. Her atheltic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world class athelete.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses a contrast between two situations - it's not that cold today, but the speaker still chooses to go by car to avoid getting sick. The sentence implies that the speaker values their health over the discomfort of the cold weather.

Option A also presents a contrast between two situations - the speaker is familiar with the woods and doesn't need a map, but they still brought one ""in case"" they got lost during the hike. This sentence also implies that the speaker values being prepared for potential challenges over the convenience of not carrying a map.

The other options do not present a similar contrast between two situations. Option B talks about a person's skills and their performance, Option C talks about a person's athletic career and their progression, and Option D talks about a person's emotional state and their behavior. None of these options present a contrast between two situations like the target and option A do."

C. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.
D. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves the idea of not being too demanding or greedy. In the context of the target sentence, it's about not negotiating too much and risking the offer being taken back. In the given sentence, it's about making do with the current situation (the cold weather) instead of waiting for it to change (warm up). Both sentences convey the idea of being content with what's available and not pushing for more, which can lead to negative consequences."
42,"Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.","A. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.

C. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.
D. Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences involve taking a precautionary measure despite being familiar with the situation. In the target sentence, the person brings a map even though they know the woods, while in the analogous sentence, they build a fire to keep warm even though they are cold."

D. Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.

The target sentence is giving advice to keep a jug of water near the table in case of thirst at night. This is similar to the option D, which is giving advice to take an umbrella even though it's currently sunny, as a precautionary measure for potential rain. Both sentences are providing a proactive measure to avoid an inconvenience or problem in the future."

C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also conveys a strong determination and commitment to a course of action. The wife is fully committed to her role in the kitchen and is willing to take responsibility for the family's meals, even if it means they might go hungry if she fails. This is similar to the situation in the target sentence, where the speaker is committed to finishing the report, even if it means staying up all night."

D. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.",B,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence and identify the key elements.
- The sentence expresses a decision to persevere with a task and a willingness to do whatever it takes to complete it.

Step 2: Compare each option with the key elements of the target sentence.

Option A: This sentence talks about a girl wanting to buy a dress and someone giving her advice not to count her chickens before they hatch. It does not relate to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option B: This sentence talks about someone's determination to cook a Thanksgiving dinner from scratch, which is somewhat similar to the target sentence as it also involves determination and a willingness to do whatever it takes.

Option C: This sentence talks about someone finishing a meal quickly, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option D: This sentence talks about someone letting off rage and sitting down like a lamb, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

Based on the analysis, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option B. It talks about someone's determination to do something, which is similar to the target sentence's key element of persevering with a task and doing whatever it takes to complete it."

C. You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.
D. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.",D,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence to understand its main idea and tone.

The target sentence talks about a team's defeat, their decision to fire their manager, and their determination to win the title this season. It conveys a sense of determination and focus.

Step 2: Analyze each option to determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.

A. The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.
This sentence talks about a negative outcome (economic depression) caused by certain actions (risky fiscal policies), but it lacks the determination and focus found in the target sentence.

B. Post graduation, Emily decided to not go for any jobs but instead chose to travel and paint for enjoyment.
This sentence talks about a decision made after a significant event (graduation), but it lacks the competitive spirit and focus on winning found in the target sentence.

C. You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.
This sentence talks about the importance of working hard, but it lacks the determination to win and the focus on a specific goal (winning the title) found in the target sentence.

D. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.
This sentence talks about a determination to complete a project and a willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal, which is similar to the determination and focus found in the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous sentence.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is D. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done. This sentence conveys a strong determination to complete a goal, which is similar to the determination and focus found in the target sentence."
47,The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.,"A.

C. I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown.
D. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.",D,"
The correct answer is:

A. Gary started investing his money and time in creating a small garden for himself during the off season. Gary regrets not planning and starting during the spring and summer season when results are more visible.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is A because it also involves a person making a decision or taking an action based on their current situation, and experiencing some kind of outcome or consequence. In this case, Gary made a decision to invest in a garden during the off season, and now he regrets not doing it during the spring and summer when the results would be more visible. This is similar to the poker player liking the hand he was dealt and keeping on calling until he had staked all his money. Both sentences involve a person making a choice and experiencing a consequence based on that choice."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it talks about someone (royals) making sacrifices (for the sake of their image) and putting in a lot of hard work (to maintain their status) in order to achieve a certain goal (looking glamorous and happy). This is similar to John's situation in the target sentence, where he is studying hard and making sacrifices to achieve his goal of landing a good job."

The correct answer is:

B. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.

Explanation:

The target sentence describes the director's efforts to complete the film despite bankrupting his production company. The sentence implies that the director put in a lot of effort and hard work to achieve his goal, despite the negative consequences.

Option A is not analogous because it talks about parents who may not feel they are good parents but still put in effort to spend quality time with their children.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about a famous football player, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about staying up all night to finish a report, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B, on the other hand, talks about someone who may not have confidence in their skills but still puts in the effort to produce good work. This is analogous to the target sentence where the director may not have been successful in saving his production company, but he still put in a lot of effort to complete the film."
50,"I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.","A. Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.

C. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.
D. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.",D,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence talks about determination, commitment, and taking action towards a goal. The speaker has set a goal to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and is working hard towards it.

Step 2: Analyze the options
Option A talks about being prepared for a situation that might arise in the future. Option B talks about the difficulty of achieving a goal and the lack of commitment. Option C talks about a desperate situation where a different strategy is used due to a lack of resources. Option D talks about someone's strong beliefs and their determination to follow through with them.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option
Option D is the most analogous to the target sentence as it talks about someone's strong beliefs and their determination to follow through with them, which is similar to the speaker's determination to go through the spreadsheets by Monday.

Answer: D"
51,I am determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.,"A. He made the final cut to the university just by a small margin.
B. A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.
C. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.
D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses the speaker's determination to face a challenging task, despite the difficulties involved. Similarly, option D also talks about someone putting in all their effort and energy into a challenging task, i.e., training for a final race. The other options do not convey the same sense of determination and perseverance in the face of difficulty."
52,Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.,"A. They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.
B. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.
C. In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.
D. Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in that it conveys the idea of putting in a lot of effort or commitment to a task, just like Harry did in his training. The phrase ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" means that if you've already committed to doing something, you might as well go all the way and do it to the best of your ability. This is similar to Harry's dedication to his training, where he put in every ounce of energy he had."
53,Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.,"A. Don't trust everything on the social media. It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.
B. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.
C. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
D. Walter failed his exam, but his father only responded, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk,"" when he arrived.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Sally's unwavering determination and conviction towards her religious beliefs, despite potential opposition or criticism. Similarly, option B talks about a person's firm decision to complete a project, no matter what obstacles or challenges they might face. Both sentences highlight the individual's strong resolve and determination, making option B the most analogous choice."
54,I was completely against nationalization. I resisted it wholeheartedly even though I became quite unpopular in the process.,"A. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
D. All that glitters is not gold.",A,"
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- The person is against something (nationalization)
- They resist it strongly
- They become unpopular

Step 2: Analyze each option:

Option A: Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
- This sentence talks about a person being adamant and stubborn about their beliefs and going through with something despite opposition.

Option B: I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
- This sentence talks about a person wanting something (a house) but having to settle for something else due to circumstances.

Option C: Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
- This sentence talks about a process (the stove's heat melting the chocolate) and the result of that process.

Option D: All that glitters is not gold.
- This sentence is a proverb and doesn't fit the context of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option:

Option A is the most analogous to the target sentence because it talks about a person being adamant and stubborn about their beliefs and going through with something despite opposition, which is similar to the target sentence where the person is against something (nationalization) and resists it strongly."
55,Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
C. Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.
D. In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A succession of waves battered the rock.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences describe an unwavering attachment or persistence towards a particular idea or goal. In the target sentence, Larry is so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer can convince him otherwise. In the given sentence, the waves persistently batter the rock, not allowing it to remain still or untouched. Both sentences illustrate a relentless and unyielding force that continues to act upon the subject, despite any potential obstacles or distractions."
56,"The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.","A. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.

C. Doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run.
D. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.",A,"
The correct answer is:

C. Doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run.

Explanation:

The target sentence compares the efficiency of a drawing to the information provided by a book. It suggests that the drawing can convey a lot of information quickly and effectively, just like a book can provide a lot of information over many pages. 

Option A is analogous because it compares the efficiency of hearing a startup's business pitch to the information provided by their marketing and advertising. Just as the drawing can provide a quick, comprehensive overview of the startup's business, hearing the pitch directly from the source can provide a more efficient and effective understanding of the business than going through their marketing materials.

Option B is also analogous because it compares the efficiency of resolving small issues in relationships immediately to preventing bigger troubles down the road. Just as the drawing can show the overall picture of a situation quickly, resolving small issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into bigger problems.

Option D is not analogous because it does not compare the efficiency of one method to another, but rather describes a person's emotional state and his sister's advice. It does not convey the same comparison of efficiency as the target sentence."
57,I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.,"A. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.
B. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.
C. The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.
D. Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.",B,"
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence.
- The target sentence talks about choosing to watch an adaptation instead of reading the original source material.

Step 2: Analyze the options and identify the most analogous element.
- Option A talks about a child causing problems when bored.
- Option B compares hearing a business pitch to other forms of marketing and advertising.
- Option C discusses the contrast between the public perception of celebrity life and the reality of their problems.
- Option D talks about a person's fear of computers and their decision to try writing a program.

Step 3: Choose the option that best matches the key elements of the target sentence.
- Option A and C both involve contrasting two different forms of something (a child's behavior and a celebrity's life). However, Option C is more analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a contrast between two forms of something (public perception and reality).

Answer: C"
58,A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.,"A. Ron comes up with detailed and complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.
B. I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.
C. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.
D. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.

Explanation:

The target sentence compares the effectiveness of a picture of diseased lungs on cigarette packs to a statutory warning message. It suggests that the picture is more effective because it is more vivid and attention-grabbing.

Option A talks about someone who doesn't have responsibilities and comes up with complex pranks. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it doesn't compare two things or situations.

Option B talks about watching an adaptation instead of reading the books it's based on. This is not analogous because it doesn't compare two things or situations.

Option D talks about someone who dresses simply but is actually a millionaire. This is not analogous because it doesn't compare two things or situations.

Option C talks about a painter who didn't have the yellow color he wanted, so he used red instead, and his painting became famous for its unconventional choice. This is analogous to the target sentence because it compares the effectiveness of the painter's unconventional choice (using red instead of yellow) to the effectiveness of the diseased lungs picture on cigarette packs (using a vivid image instead of a statutory warning message)."
59,Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.,"A. The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.
B. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
C. Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.
D. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.",B,"
The target sentence compares the value of hearing a startup's business pitch to the value of their marketing and advertising. It suggests that the pitch was more informative than the marketing and advertising. 

Option A is not analogous because it talks about a person's career choice and job search, which is unrelated to the comparison made in the target sentence.

Option B is analogous because it compares the usefulness of a map with directions to the usefulness of instructions. Just as the target sentence compares the value of hearing a startup's pitch to the value of their marketing, Option B compares the value of a map with directions to the value of instructions.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about a personal decision to end a friendly interaction, which is unrelated to the comparison made in the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about a group completing a project on time, which is unrelated to the comparison made in the target sentence."
60,It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.,"A. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.
B. Mary prefered to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.
C. The presentation was such a mess! The presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.
D. When he finally started earning after years of struggle, Alex spent all his money on drinks and parties as he wanted to enjoy his life now.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Mary preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.

Explanation:

The target sentence compares two methods of achieving a goal (arriving at an event) and suggests that one method (using a map with directions) is more effective than the other (reading instructions). Similarly, option B compares two methods of learning (diagrams vs. notes) and suggests that one method (diagrams) is more effective than the other (notes) for conveying information. In both cases, the comparison is made based on the clarity and effectiveness of the method."
61,Mary prefered to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.,"A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.
B. Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.
C. Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.
D. The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages."
62,"I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.","A. I have decided to see the project through and I will do anything to get the work done.
B. While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.
C. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.
D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also expresses a situation where a person or thing is forced to accept something less desirable due to circumstances beyond their control. In this case, the water has to flow through a narrow pipe, which is not its preferred path, but it has no other choice due to the physical constraints of the situation. Similarly, in the target sentence, the speaker would have preferred a house of their own, but due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e., being a beggar), they have to accept sharing a house instead."
63,"That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.","A. Jake might look confused all the time, but he's really extremely bright.
B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.
D. Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses a sentiment of accepting something that is not the first choice due to a constraint or limitation. The sentence ""I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose"" also conveys a similar sentiment. The speaker would have preferred a different situation (a house of their own), but due to certain constraints (being broke), they are forced to accept a less desirable option (sharing). This is analogous to the target sentence where the speaker would have chosen a different dress but accepted a free one due to being broke.

The other options do not convey the same sentiment. 

Option A talks about Jake's confusion, which is unrelated to the target sentence.

Option C talks about a congressman being too involved in the wording of his bill, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option D talks about Sarah booking honeymoon tickets before being proposed to, which is also unrelated to the target sentence."
64,"I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.","A. John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.
B. Don't trust everything on the social media. It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.
C. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.
D. For not submitting her homework on time, Amy falsely made up an excuse that her dog ate it but the professor decided to penalize her.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a situation where the speaker is given an option they did not choose, but they have to use it due to their circumstances. In this case, the speaker is given a ""rusty"" bicycle by Joe, which they did not ask for, but they have to use it because they have no other option. Similarly, in the analogy, the speaker is given a dress they did not choose, but they have to use it because they cannot afford to buy a better one."
65,I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.,"A. It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.
B. Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.
C. Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.
D. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.

The target sentence talks about wanting something (going out for dinner) but not having the resources (money) to do it, so an alternative solution (eating leftover rice) is chosen.

Option A talks about not doing something bad just because others do it, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B talks about Ramos going to a cabin to finish writing a novel, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about being afraid of something (walking on the streets at night) but eventually doing it, which is not related to the target sentence."
66,Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.,"A. They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back.
B. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.
C. With no homework to do, I spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.
D. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a situation where the person doesn't get exactly what they want but still accept it due to certain circumstances. In the target sentence, Mary wanted a big dog house but couldn't get it because Peter couldn't afford it, so she made one from cardboard boxes. Similarly, in the given sentence, the person wanted a different dress but couldn't afford it, so they accepted a free dress."
67,"While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.","A. Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.
B. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
C. There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.
D. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in that it presents a personal preference or opinion that may not align with the general consensus. The speaker is expressing their individual viewpoint despite the potential disagreement from others. This is similar to the target sentence where the speaker is expressing their contentment with sleeping on the sofa despite the societal expectation of having a bed."
68,"By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.","A. Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.
B. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
C. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.
D. She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences are about a situation where someone is in a less-than-ideal situation and has to make a decision based on that situation. In the target sentence, the person's friend is in a difficult financial situation and has to sell his house. In the analogous sentence, the person is in a job they don't like and is considering quitting in the hope of finding a better job. Both sentences convey a message about making decisions based on the current situation rather than relying on hope or wishful thinking."
69,"After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.","A. It was a fantastic vacation, but all good things come to an end.
B. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.
C. Claire always thought that Max was unkind and rude because of his edgy fashion sense. But once she learned how kind and sensitive he was, she was surprised.
D. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.",D,"
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- Losing half of the soldiers
- No other option
- Using the tank to fight

Step 2: Analyze each option and determine which one has the most similar elements to the target sentence:

Option A: This sentence talks about a vacation ending, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option B: This sentence talks about a TV show ending, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option C: This sentence talks about a person changing their opinion about someone based on new information, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option D: This sentence talks about borrowing a bicycle and having no other choice, which is related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the option that is most analogous to the target sentence.

Answer: D"
70,"As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.","A. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.
B. We all begin our lives as a baby and slowly learn and grow.
C. I can see that you are beside yourself with joy at being selected for the job, congratulations.
D. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.",A,"
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the target sentence.
- The target sentence is about a situation where a negative event (missing the plane) led to a positive outcome (meeting someone).

Step 2: Analyze each option and determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.
- Option A is about a situation where a negative (not having the yellow color) led to a positive outcome (creating an unconventional painting).
- Option B is about a universal truth (everyone starts as a baby) and does not have a negative event leading to a positive outcome.
- Option C is about someone being overjoyed at a positive event (being selected for a job), but it does not involve a negative event leading to a positive outcome.
- Option D is about someone's poor speaking skills leading to a positive outcome (good music production), but it does not involve a negative event leading to a positive outcome.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
- Option A is the most analogous to the target sentence as it involves a negative situation (not having the yellow color) leading to a positive outcome (creating an unconventional painting).

Answer: A"
71,"Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.","A. By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.

C. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.
D. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it presents a situation where a particular event (my friend being broke) led to a different outcome (selling his house) than what was initially planned or expected. In the target sentence, the chicken not being brought to the party led to tasting the delicious pasta. In the analogous sentence, the friend's financial situation led to selling his house, which is a significant change from his original plan or expectation."
72,It is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.,"A. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.
B. The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.
C. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.
D. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses relief or gratitude for an event that didn't happen, which led to a positive outcome. The options are:

A. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.
This sentence talks about happiness and a positive event, but it doesn't have the same structure as the target sentence.

B. The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.
This sentence talks about a contrast between appearance and reality, but it doesn't have the same structure as the target sentence.

C. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.
This sentence talks about a positive outcome after a difficult process, but it doesn't have the same structure as the target sentence.

D. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.
This sentence expresses gratitude for a negative event (missing the plane) that led to a positive outcome (meeting someone). This structure is similar to the target sentence, making it the most analogous."
73,But if you look at the bright side you got to learn so much from the experience.,"A. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.
B. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
C. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.
D. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.

The target sentence and the given option C both express the idea of gaining valuable knowledge or insight from something unexpected or seemingly negative. In the target sentence, the speaker suggests that looking at the bright side of a negative experience can lead to learning and growth. Similarly, in option C, hearing a startup's pitch, which might initially seem uninteresting or unproductive, ends up being more informative than their marketing and advertising efforts."
74,"Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.","A. By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.
B. It is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.
C. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
D. Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.

This sentence shares a similar theme with the target sentence in that it talks about a situation where someone lost something (in this case, the friend lost his money) and ended up in a different situation (the friend had to sell his house). This is similar to the target sentence where the person lost everything in a fire but ended up moving to Arkansas where they won the state lottery. Both sentences show a contrast between a loss and a gain, and both involve a significant change in circumstances."
75,"The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.","A. It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this.

C. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.
D. The process of quiting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking.",C,"

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Her athletic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world-class athlete.

This sentence shares a similar structure with the target sentence. It starts with a beginning (her first visit to the gym), progresses through a learning and growth phase (she learned and improved), and ends with a result (she became a world-class athlete). The other options do not follow this structure as closely."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Her athletic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world-class athlete.

Explanation:

The target sentence and the selected option A both follow a similar structure. They both start with a specific action or event (quitting smoking or visiting the gym) that marks the beginning of a process or journey. The subsequent actions or events (desire to quit smoking or starting an athletic career) are then described as the continuation of this process. The end result (quitting smoking or becoming a world-class athlete) is mentioned at the end, showing the ultimate outcome of this journey.

The other options (B, C, and D) do not follow the same structure or theme as the target sentence. Option B talks about the consequences of a failed venture and the importance of backup plans, which is not directly related to the process of quitting smoking. Option C describes the development of a suburban community, which is not a process or journey.

Similarly, the target sentence describes the person's journey from social anxiety to becoming a powerful and persuasive public speaker. Both sentences show a transformation from a starting point to a successful outcome, making option A the most analogous."

Option B: After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.
This sentence talks about a person's behavior change after expressing anger, but it doesn't relate to the key elements in the target sentence.

Option C: If my project partner hadn't gotten sick I never would have need to finish the entire assignment on my own by working day and night.
This sentence talks about a situation where the speaker had to work hard due to a partner's absence, but it doesn't relate to the key elements in the target sentence.

Option D: Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.
This sentence talks about a person's strong attachment to a specific employer, but it doesn't relate to the key elements in the target sentence.

Step 3: Determine the most analogous option.

Option A, B, C, and D all have different topics and don't relate to the key elements in the target sentence. Therefore, none of them are analogous to the target sentence.

Answer: None of the above (A, B, C, D)"

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- Megan, a lousy student
- worked twice as hard
- revised her basics
- mentor two new members of the team

Step 2: Analyze each option and determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.

Option A: This sentence talks about maintaining a good work-life balance and working non-stop to meet deadlines. Although it mentions hard work, it doesn't directly relate to the key elements in the target sentence.

D. After going through an extensive workload, Ally got very sick and will be doing nothing but rest during this weekend.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it talks about the actions of one person (your friend going to the spa) and how it doesn't justify another person (you) doing the same thing (not doing homework). It emphasizes the importance of making individual choices based on personal responsibility and not just following the actions of others. This is similar to the target sentence which talks about doing a bad thing just because someone else has done it, and how it's not acceptable."
89,"You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.","A. But if you look at the bright side you got to learn so much from the experience.

D. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is advising against the use of a pen for gossip and rumors, despite others doing so. It is emphasizing the importance of making the right choice, even if others are not.

Option A is not analogous as it talks about looking at the bright side and learning from experiences, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B is also not analogous as it talks about following someone's example and making the wrong choice due to having work to do, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is not analogous as it talks about keeping a jug of water near the table for thirst, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D, on the other hand, talks about challenging ideas through reading books, which is similar to the target sentence's emphasis on making the right choice, even if others are not."

D. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also uses the same structure of ""just because [person] does/doesn't do something doesn't mean you can/should do it too."" In this case, the friend is not cleaning up after themselves, and the speaker is suggesting that this behavior does not justify the listener from also not cleaning up. The other options do not follow the same structure and are not as relevant to the target sentence."
91,Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.,"A. Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not the right choice as she had a lot of work to do.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences involve someone doing something that is not the best choice, despite the influence of someone else's actions. In the target sentence, the friend is choosing to go to the spa instead of doing her homework, while in the analogous sentence, Sally is choosing to relax instead of doing her work. Both sentences emphasize the importance of making the right choice and not following someone else's actions blindly."
92,Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.,"A. Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Sally following her sister's example of relaxing, but it was not the right choice because she had a lot of work to do. The given options are:

Option A: This sentence talks about politicians who frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. However, they could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. This is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences talk about a person making a choice that is not the right one, despite the potential benefits of doing so.

Option B: This sentence talks about David's work ethic and his manager's potential bad reviews. It does not have a similar structure or theme to the target sentence.

Option C: This sentence talks about Larry purchasing a home at a low price when it was undeveloped and how the price has risen. It does not have a similar structure or theme to the target sentence.

Option D: This sentence talks about a friend going to the spa instead of doing homework, and how it does not mean that the listener can do the same. It does not have a similar structure or theme to the target sentence."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.

Explanation:

The target sentence is advising Mary not to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer by dropping out of school. Similarly, option C is advising someone not to engage in gossip and rumors, even though others might be doing so.

D. My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.",C,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence and identify the key elements and themes.

The target sentence talks about a vacation that was enjoyable, but now it has ended. It implies that something good has come to an end, and this is a common theme in many situations.

Step 2: Compare each option with the target sentence and identify the most analogous one.

Option A talks about the beginning of a journey, which is a different theme. Option B talks about consequences for not complying with policies, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence. Option C talks about the end of a period of time (college), which is similar to the theme of the target sentence. Option D talks about the impact of a small daily expense, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

C. While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.
D. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Sachin, who is considered the best cricketer in the world, but had to retire. The sentence highlights the contrast between his status and the reality of having to retire.

Option A talks about soldiers and a tank, which doesn't have a similar contrast or context.

Option B talks about greed and negotiation, which also doesn't have a similar contrast or context.

Option D talks about a person winning Grammy awards and being considered a god of rap, which also doesn't have a similar contrast or context.

Option C, on the other hand, talks about a popular president who had to step down due to the rules of the constitution. This sentence has a similar contrast between popularity and the necessity to retire, similar to the target sentence."
96,"While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.","A. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

C. Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.
D. I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

In this sentence, the person is focusing on a small detail (the doorknob) while ignoring the bigger picture (the entire house renovation). Similarly, in the target sentence, the president was very popular but had to step down at the end of his term according to the rules (the larger picture), despite his popularity."
97,"I have had a great time in college, but tomorrow I will be graduating.","A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.
B. A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.
C. No need to take so much work this quarter, as performance won't impact appraisals. Work more in the next two quarters when the management will actively prioritize it.
D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it talks about a significant event (the best time of your life) that is ending (the end of your 20s), and the speaker is giving advice to enjoy it while it lasts. The target sentence talks about a significant event (graduating from college) that is ending, and the speaker is giving advice to enjoy the time while it lasts."
98,I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.,"A. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.
B. You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.
C. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.
D. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses a desire for something to continue indefinitely, despite it having ended. The sentence ""After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb"" also expresses a change from a state of intensity (letting off his rage) to a state of calmness (sitting down like a lamb). This change in state is similar to the change from the TV show ending to the desire for it to continue. 

Option A talks about finishing a meal, which is a different type of ending than the TV show ending. 

Option B talks about relieving stress, which is not related to the TV show ending. 

Option D talks about obsessing over a past relationship, which is also unrelated to the TV show ending."
99,"But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.","A. A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.
B. A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.
C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

In this sentence, John's actions (bringing out dishes) are happening quickly, and before the guests realize it, they are already enjoying the meal. This is similar to the target sentence, where the person finishes the meal before realizing it."
100,"Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.","A. Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth since the audition was about to be closed.
B. Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.

A. Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth since the audition was about to be closed.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is an encouragement to enjoy a specific period of life, which is the 20s. The sentence is advising the reader to take advantage of this time since it will not last forever.

The sentence A is also about a limited opportunity that was barely achieved. It talks about Lester making the dance team just in time before the audition closed. This is analogous to the target sentence because it also emphasizes the importance of seizing an opportunity before it slips away.

The other options (B, C, D) do not share the same theme of limited time or seizing an opportunity. Option B is about a proud parent, option C is about a quick meal, and option D is about people socializing at a conference. None of these sentences convey the same message as the target sentence or option A."
101,"You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.","A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.
B. All that glitters is not gold.
C. Don’t lie to land a job, remember that honesty is the best policy.
D. You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.

This sentence is analogous because it also emphasizes the importance of making the most of a particular situation while it is available. The target sentence advises the reader to work hard while they are still in their current location because they won't have those opportunities once they move across the country. Similarly, the sentence ""Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts"" encourages the reader to make the most of their youth because it won't last forever. Both sentences stress the importance of taking advantage of a limited opportunity or time period."
102,"When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.","A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
B. I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.
C. A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.
D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the given target sentence is:

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.

The target sentence talks about the impermanence of a situation, specifically the availability of delicious mangoes during a certain season. The sentence urges people to enjoy the mangoes before they are no longer available.

Option D also talks about the impermanence of a situation, in this case, the availability of sunshine during a specific season. It encourages people to appreciate the sunshine while it lasts, as it will not be available for a significant part of the year.

The other options do not share the same theme of impermanence and urgency to enjoy a situation before it changes. Option A talks about deceptive practices, option B is about personal grudges, and option C is about someone finally succeeding after multiple failures."
103,Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.,"A. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.
C. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.
D. She has been talking trash about us all week to everyone. So I don't feel sorry for her when someone spilled all her secrets.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is advising someone to enjoy a specific period of their life (the honeymoon phase of a marriage) before it passes. Similarly, option B is advising someone to enjoy a specific period of their life (their 20s) before it passes. Both sentences are giving advice to enjoy a fleeting period of life that will not last forever.

Option A is about overcoming fear to try something new, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option C is about financial advice, not about enjoying a period of life.

Option D is about someone's secrets being exposed, which is not related to the theme of enjoying a period of life."
104,Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.,"A. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.

C. The music producer selects a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client.
D. Mary prefered to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Mary preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.

Explanation:

The target sentence is advising someone to not think about work or stress while on vacation and to enjoy themselves because the vacation is short. The sentence is giving a suggestion or advice, and it is not related to the other options.

Option A talks about a job being secured after a successful interview, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B is about a president having to step down as per the rules, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is about a music producer choosing a less liked song for a client, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is about someone preferring to learn from diagrams rather than notes, which is similar to the target sentence in that it is giving a preference or suggestion. It is not directly related to work or stress, and it is not about a long-term commitment like a job or presidency. It is a simple preference, which is the most analogous to the target sentence."
105,Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.,"A. You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap. Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound.
B. Since both of our favourite teams have lost, lets enjoy the world cup together and not fight.
C. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal.
D. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap. Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it emphasizes the importance of considering the future implications of current actions. In the target sentence, the speaker is urging people to appreciate the sunshine during the summer because it may not be available in the winter. In the analogous sentence, the speaker is cautioning against selling all shares when the market is low, as it may rebound in the future. Both sentences stress the importance of considering future possibilities based on current circumstances."

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do.
- An idle brain is the devil's workshop.

Step 2: Analyze the options and identify the one that has a similar structure and meaning:
- A. With no homework to do, I spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.
- B. The technical lead informed the team that they have to follow his ideas for the project to be completed without question or risk failure.
- C. Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through.
- D. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick I never would have need to finish the entire assignment on my own by working day and night.

Step 3: Compare the options and choose the one that best matches the target sentence:
- A. This option has a similar structure to the target sentence as it talks about someone finding ways to annoy another person when they have nothing else to do.
- B. This option does not have a similar structure or meaning to the target sentence.
- C. This option does not have a similar structure or meaning to the target sentence.
- D. This option does not have a similar structure or meaning to the target sentence.

Answer: A"
107,"With no homework to do, I spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.","A. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.
B. The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.
C. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.
D. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence to identify the key elements and their relationships.

- The subject is ""I"" and the action is ""spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.""
- The reason for this action is ""With no homework to do.""

Step 2: Compare each option with the target sentence and identify the most analogous one.

- Option A: The subject is ""he"" and the action is ""obsessing over his previous girlfriend."" The reason for this action is ""Since he had nothing else to do during the break.""
- Option B: The subject is ""the doctor"" and the action is ""asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks."" The reason for this action is ""The doctor had an important surgery the next day.""
- Option C: The subject is ""you"" and the action is ""applied to several companies instead of just one."" The reason for this action is ""It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.""
- Option D: The subject is ""she"" and the action is ""thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it."" The reason for this action is ""She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it.""

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option based on the relationships between the elements in the target sentence and the options.

Option A has a similar structure to the target sentence, with a subject and an action that is caused by a reason. The reason in Option A is similar to the reason in the target sentence, as both involve having nothing else to do. However, the actions are different, as the target sentence involves coming up with ways to annoy someone, while Option A involves obsessing over a previous girlfriend.

Option B has a different structure, as it involves a command or request rather than an action caused by a reason. The reason in Option B is also different, as it involves an important surgery rather than having nothing else to do.

Option C has a different structure, as it involves a piece of advice or suggestion rather than an action caused by a reason. The reason in Option C is also different, as it involves the benefits of applying to several companies rather than having nothing else to do.

Option D has a different structure, as it involves a thought or observation rather than an action caused by a reason. The reason in Option D is also different, as it involves the attractiveness of a neighbor's home rather than having nothing else to do.

Based on the similarities in structure and reason, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is A."

D. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",B,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence to identify the key elements and the situation.
- Kate was fired from her job and has nothing else to do.
- She spends her time imagining schemes to get her boss fired.

Step 2: Analyze each option to determine which one is the most analogous to the target sentence.
- A: A liquid flowing from a large container to a smaller one through a narrow pipe. This does not relate to the target sentence as it does not involve a person with nothing to do and imagining schemes.
- B: Ron, who is not given any responsibilities, comes up with detailed and complex pranks. This option relates to the target sentence as it involves someone with nothing to do (Ron) and imagining schemes (pranks).
- C: He always argues on the silliest topics. This option does not relate to the target sentence as it does not involve a person with nothing to do and imagining schemes.
- D: He collapsed after running a marathon. This option does not relate to the target sentence as it does not involve a person with nothing to do and imagining schemes.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
- Option B is the most analogous to the target sentence as it involves someone with nothing to do (Ron) and imagining schemes (pranks).

Answer: B"

D. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.",D,"
Step 1: Understand the target sentence
The target sentence talks about how Ron's lack of responsibilities leads him to come up with complex pranks.

Step 2: Analyze the options
Option A talks about the destination being more important than the journey.
Option B talks about someone rushing to finish work but having to redo it due to complaints.
Option C talks about the process of quitting smoking starting with a desire to quit.
Option D talks about someone obsessing over an ex-girlfriend during a break.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option
Option C is the most analogous as it talks about a process starting with a desire, which is similar to how Ron's lack of responsibilities leads him to come up with complex pranks.

C. The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.
D. Ron comes up with detailed and complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.",D,"
Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence and the options.

The target sentence is about a person who has nothing else to do during a break and is obsessing over his previous girlfriend.

The options are:
- A person who has been working for a company for two years and is burned out.
- A reminder not to rush through an assignment.
- A poker player who likes his hand and keeps calling until he stakes all his money.
- A person who doesn't have responsibilities and comes up with complex pranks.

Step 2: Identify the most analogous option.

The most analogous option to the target sentence is the poker player who likes his hand and keeps calling until he stakes all his money. This is because both the target sentence and the poker player option are about someone who is fixated on something and continues to engage with it despite potential negative consequences.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about the students creating a mess in the class when there is no teacher to monitor. It implies that the absence of a teacher leads to chaos and misbehavior among the students.

Option C also talks about misuse of resources or tools. In this case, the tool is a pen, which is being used for gossip and rumors. Even though others (media reporters) are doing so, it doesn't make it right or justifiable. This option is analogous to the target sentence as it also talks about the misuse of a tool or resource due to the absence of proper supervision or guidance."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager and scrambled to setup the new system from scratch.

The target sentence is advising the reader to take immediate action to prevent a potential problem (car malfunctioning) and the analogous sentence is about a person (David) who is at risk of receiving negative consequences (bad reviews) and is taking immediate action (setting up a new system) to prevent it. The phrase ""a stitch in time saves nine"" in the target sentence emphasizes the importance of taking action promptly to avoid future problems, which is also reflected in the analogous sentence where David is taking action to prevent a negative outcome."
113,I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.,"A. I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it talks about taking precautions to prevent a potential problem (getting lost during the hike) by bringing a map, just as resolving small issues in relationships immediately can prevent bigger troubles down the road."

C. Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.
D. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it presents a situation where a specific tool (map with directions) would have made a task easier or more efficient. In the target sentence, having a computer earlier would have made it possible to fix the malfunction. In the analogous sentence, using a map with directions would have made it easier to arrive at the event."

D. You can't pour from an empty cup.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""You can't pour from an empty cup.""

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in the sense that it conveys a message about the importance of taking action or making a decision at the right time. In the target sentence, the speaker is expressing regret for not going to the doctor earlier, which could have led to a cure. In the analogous sentence, the phrase ""can't pour from an empty cup"" suggests that one cannot give or do something if they don't have the necessary resources or energy. This is similar to the target sentence's implication that if one doesn't take action when they should, they may miss an opportunity to solve a problem or achieve a goal."
117,"It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this.","A. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

This sentence expresses a situation where a decision or action was not taken at the appropriate time, leading to negative consequences. In this case, the speaker wishes they had taken action earlier (going by car) to avoid a potential problem (getting sick). This is similar to the target sentence, where the speaker wishes they had discussed the problem immediately, but now it's too late and more work is required to fix it."
118,We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!.,"A. While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.

Option A: This sentence talks about a rule and a person's action, but it doesn't give advice or have a similar structure.

Option B: This sentence talks about a person's focus and action, but it doesn't give advice or have a similar structure.

Option C: This sentence talks about compromise and tensions, but it doesn't give advice or have a similar structure.

Option D: This sentence talks about work and deadlines, but it doesn't give advice or have a similar structure.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option.

Option C is the most analogous because it talks about taking action (compromising with a neighbour) and gives advice (letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball). However, it doesn't have the same structure as the target sentence.

Option B is the most analogous because it talks about a person's action (finishing a project) and gives advice (switching off all of his devices). It also has a similar structure to the target sentence."
119,We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.,"A. You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.

C. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.
D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence to understand its main idea and purpose.
The target sentence emphasizes the importance of registering for courses early to secure a seat. It suggests that if one waits too long, they might miss the opportunity.

Step 2: Examine each option and determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.

Option A: This sentence talks about the importance of going to the doctor early for a cure, but it doesn't have the same emphasis on securing a seat or opportunity as the target sentence.

Option B: This sentence talks about finding a silver lining in a negative situation, but it doesn't relate to the target sentence's main idea of securing a seat.

Option C: This sentence talks about preferring an old tool over a new one, which is not related to the target sentence's main idea of registering for courses early.

Option D: This sentence talks about appreciating the sunshine during summer because it's not available in winter, but it doesn't have the same emphasis on securing a seat as the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

The most analogous option to the target sentence is D, as it also emphasizes the importance of securing something (sunshine) before it becomes unavailable."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a situation where something was initially affordable but later became unaffordable. The sentence also mentions a person (Larry) who was able to take advantage of the situation. 

Option C also talks about a situation where something was initially difficult to achieve but later became possible. It also mentions a person (Clark) who was able to achieve it after a long time. 

Option A talks about sharing an incident with someone who experienced it, which is not related to the target sentence.

C. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.
D. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also emphasizes the importance of taking action early to secure a favorable outcome. In this case, the favorable outcome is getting a seat in the desired course by submitting the registration early. The other options do not share the same focus on taking action early to secure a favorable outcome."
122,"You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate. Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic.","A. Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to.

C. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.
D. It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this.

Explanation:

The target sentence emphasizes the importance of immediate action to avoid negative consequences. It suggests that if one does not act promptly, they will face difficulties due to traffic.

Option D also highlights the importance of timely action to avoid negative consequences. It states that if a problem had been addressed earlier, it would have been easier to resolve. However, since it was not addressed promptly, a lot of work is now required to rectify the situation.

Option A talks about booking honeymoon tickets before a proposal, which is unrelated to the target sentence.

Option B discusses receiving recognition and getting a promotion, which is also unrelated to the target sentence.

Option C advises against spending all savings on expensive items during holidays, which is not related to the target sentence."

D. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.

Reasoning:

The target sentence provides advice on when to arrive at a place (the museum) to avoid a crowd. It suggests coming one hour before the peak time (between six and eight in the morning) to have a better experience.

Option A is not analogous because it talks about getting information directly from the source, which is not related to timing or avoiding crowds.

Option B is not analogous because it talks about attacking every point in an argument, which is not related to timing or avoiding crowds.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about the negative effects of smoking, which is not related to timing or avoiding crowds."
124,"I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.","A. The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.
B. David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager and scrambled to setup the new system from scratch.
C. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.
D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about how personal preferences can influence one's perception of something. It says that while the speaker may not like the color of someone's car, they understand that beauty is subjective and can vary from person to person.

Option D is the most analogous because it also talks about something that is often misunderstood or underappreciated (mathematics) and how one person finds it beautiful and meaningful despite this. The sentence highlights the contrast between the general public's view and the speaker's personal perspective, much like the target sentence."

D. Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.

In this sentence, the speaker is expressing their personal opinion about a subject (the color combination of orange and green) that is not universally liked. They acknowledge the existence of people who dislike this combination, but they still hold a different viewpoint. This is similar to the target sentence, where the speaker acknowledges that the singer is not their favorite, but their brother adores him."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.

This sentence shares the same theme as the target sentence, which is about waiting and the eventual achievement of a goal. The target sentence talks about waiting for someone for three hours, but it's okay because it's better late than never. Similarly, the sentence D talks about taking three years instead of one to finish a training program, but at least the person has the credential now.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.

Explanation:

The target sentence and the chosen option all share a common structure, which is the use of a contrasting element followed by a positive statement. In the target sentence, the contrast is between the time it took to send the letter (two weeks) and the fact that it was sent. In the chosen option, the contrast is between the age of the laptop (oldest) and the fact that Lexi enjoys using it. Both sentences convey a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment despite an initial challenge or expectation."
132,"A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.","A. Her atheltic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world class athelete.
B. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.
C. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.
D. The baby looks as snug as a bug in a rug next to her mother.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Her athletic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world-class athlete.

Reasoning:

The target sentence tells a story of a person who failed 12th grade for five years but finally succeeded in passing. The sentence starts with a negative situation (failing 12th grade) and ends with a positive outcome (passing).

Option A also starts with a negative situation (starting with the first visit to the gym) and ends with a positive outcome (becoming a world-class athlete). It also uses a time frame (five years) to show the duration of the struggle and the ultimate success.

Option B talks about sending a letter after two weeks, which is not a strong analogy to the target sentence.

Option C talks about watering a garden even if it's raining, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about a baby being snug next to its mother, which is not related to the target sentence."

D. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.",C,"
The correct answer is C. Although she realized the mistake a week after the incident, she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence because it also talks about a delay in realization and subsequent action. In the target sentence, the person took three years to finish a training program, while in the analogous sentence, the person realized their mistake a week after the incident but waited two years before apologizing and confessing. Both sentences involve a delay between realization and action, making them similar in structure and context."

- We all had lost hope but finally he came through.

Option A and C do not match these elements. Option B and D do not match these elements either.

Option B talks about realizing a mistake after a week and then apologizing after two years, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about building and losing a fortune, which is not related to the target sentence.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

Option D: Fred built an immense fortune by swindling others, but he lost it all when someone swindled him."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it emphasizes the importance of diversity and not putting all your trust in one thing. In the context of family planning, it suggests not relying on a single childcare method, but instead using a variety of methods to provide a well-rounded upbringing for the child. Similarly, the target sentence advises against investing all your money in the stock market, suggesting that diversifying your investments is a wiser strategy."

Option B is a story about a boy who lied about a wolf and faced consequences when a wolf really came.
Option C is about the importance of doing work thoroughly and responsibly to avoid problems in the long run.

B. In family planning, it's wise not to trust just one childcare method. Different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also talks about the importance of having backup plans or different approaches to achieve a desired outcome. In the target sentence, the person should have had other backup plans to avoid being ruined when his venture failed. In the analogous sentence, parents should not rely on just one method of childcare, but instead, consider different parenting styles to provide a well-rounded upbringing for their children."

C. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.
D. The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.

Step 2: Analyze the options and identify the most analogous one.

Option A talks about enjoying delicious mangoes before they are no longer available, which is not related to the target sentence's message about not rushing through an assignment.

Option B talks about someone rushing through work and causing problems for others, which is related to the target sentence's message about not rushing through an assignment.

Option C talks about applying to multiple companies, which is not related to the target sentence's message about not rushing through an assignment.

This sentence is analogous because it talks about someone else's behavior (the roommate not cleaning up) and how it doesn't mean the listener should follow the same behavior. Similarly, in the target sentence, Larry is not reading the requirements and finishing the work early, which leads to others having to fix his work. The sentence implies that just because Larry does something doesn't mean others should do the same."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a situation where someone needs to be careful and not rush through something. In this case, the person needs to thoroughly examine the files instead of quickly skimming through them. This is similar to how Kim needs to redo her work because she rushed through it the first time."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about Walter's father giving a response to his son's failure despite his disappointment. The response is a metaphorical one, using the phrase ""don't cry over spilt milk"" to convey the idea of not dwelling on past failures.

Option D is the most analogous because it also talks about something distracting from the main point, in this case, the peculiar grammar and word choice of a book. The sentence also uses a metaphor (""can't learn anything from it"") to convey the idea that the distraction is preventing the person from understanding the content.

Option A talks about someone crying and then being cheerful, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B talks about someone preferring to learn from diagrams rather than notes, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C talks about someone being upset after a breakup and a family member telling them to move on, which is not related to the target sentence."

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

This sentence is analogous because it also conveys the idea of moving forward and not dwelling on the past. It emphasizes the importance of taking the first step, regardless of how small or insignificant it may seem, in order to progress towards a goal. Similarly, the target sentence encourages the reader to move on from a past event (the interview) and focus on the next opportunity."

Step 1: Identify the main theme of the target sentence.
The main theme of the target sentence is the emotional state of Larry and how Mary helps him move on from his breakup with Samantha.

Step 2: Analyze each option and determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.

Option A: The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.
This option talks about a person being so focused on a task that they fail to see the bigger picture. While it does involve a situation where someone is not moving on, it is not directly related to emotions or relationships.

Option B: The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other.
This option talks about a situation where a conflict has ended and the parties involved are trying to maintain peace. While it involves a change in state, it is not related to emotions or relationships.

Option C: They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.
This option talks about a person who is no longer part of the family's conversation and has made a mistake in his personal life. While it involves a change in status, it is not related to emotions or relationships in the same way as the target sentence.

Option D: A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.
This option talks about an object that is no longer functional. While it involves a change in state, it is not related to emotions or relationships.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
The most analogous option to the target sentence is Option C. It talks about a person who is no longer part of the family's conversation and has made a mistake in his personal life, which is somewhat similar to Larry's situation where he is still upset months after his breakup with Samantha."

D. Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A fallen tree cannot provide shade.

Reasoning:
The target sentence talks about a situation where something (Juli's favorite tree) has fallen over and there's nothing else that can be done about it. The sentence implies that the tree's condition is irreversible and there's no way to restore it to its original state.

Option A also talks about a situation where something (a fallen tree) is in a state that it cannot function as it should. In this case, a fallen tree cannot provide shade because it's no longer standing upright and its branches are no longer in the right position to cast shade. This is similar to the target sentence in that the tree's condition is irreversible and there's nothing that can be done to restore it to its original state.

The other options (B, C, D) do not share the same theme or similarity with the target sentence. Option B talks about a happy situation where parents decided not to get a divorce, which is quite different from the target sentence. Option C talks about a person being distracted by the way a book is written, which is not related to the target sentence. Option D talks about two people, one of whom lied to get into school and the other who didn't, which is also not related to the target sentence."

The target sentence is about two people who are fans of different teams coming together to enjoy the world cup despite their teams losing. It's about finding common ground and enjoying something together instead of fighting.

Option D is the most analogous because it also talks about someone (Larry) who is upset over a situation (breaking up with Samantha) and his sister (Mary) trying to make him understand that there's no point in dwelling on it because the other person (Samantha) has moved on. It's about finding common ground and moving forward instead of dwelling on the past."

The target sentence talks about Brian's hidden ace, which he reveals at an unexpected time.

The answer is A. The deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations.

The sentence ""The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent."" is about a clever politician who has a strategy that could help him win the election, and he reveals a damaging secret about his opponent at the last moment to gain an advantage.

Option A is the most analogous because it talks about a situation where a difficult task (negotiations) has been successfully completed (the deal is in the bag), and a decisive action (revealing a secret) was taken at the last moment to secure the outcome.

Option B is not analogous because it talks about a company being sorry for not being able to pay a bonus, which is not related to a secret plan or a decisive action at the last moment.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about a situation where a contract is still up for grabs and there are more ideas to be used to win it back, which is not related to a secret plan or a decisive action at the last moment.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about a person working hard to go through spreadsheets, which is not related to a secret plan or a decisive action at the last moment."

The target sentence is about the opponents being unaware of the speaker's greatest asset (stamina) and how it gives them an advantage over the other runners. The tone is confident and assertive.

Step 2: Analyze each option to determine which one is most analogous to the target sentence.

Option A: This sentence talks about a party and the police, which is unrelated to the target sentence. It doesn't share any similar elements or tone.

Option B: This sentence talks about someone being aware of a boss's shady business dealings, which is not related to the target sentence. It doesn't share any similar elements or tone.

Option D: This sentence talks about an economic depression resulting from risky fiscal policies, which is not related to the target sentence. It doesn't share any similar elements or tone.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

The most analogous option is A, as it is the only option that doesn't share any similar elements or tone with the target sentence. It is disconnected from the topic and tone of the target sentence, making it the most analogous option."

The options are A, B, C, and D. Each option is a sentence that we need to compare to the target sentence to find the most analogous one.

Step 2: Analyze each option.

A. Brian kept quiet at the board meeting, who knew he had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.
This option talks about a person keeping quiet and having a surprise up his sleeve, but it's not directly related to a new eyewitness in a court case.

B. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.
This option talks about a person feeling reassured after getting advice, but it's not related to a court case or a new eyewitness.

C. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.
This option talks about a painter using a different color due to unavailability, but it's not related to a court case or a new eyewitness.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

Out of all the options, option C is the most analogous to the target sentence. It talks about a situation where a person had to use a different color due to unavailability, which is similar to the target sentence's idea of a fresh eyewitness being previously unknown.

The target sentence and the given sentence both convey a situation where something is impossible or not feasible due to a certain condition or limitation. In the target sentence, the person cannot be dismissed because they have knowledge of the boss's unethical business practices. In the given sentence, you cannot write with a pen that has no ink. Both sentences establish a cause-and-effect relationship where the action (dismissal or writing) cannot take place due to a specific reason or condition."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it involves a person feeling upset or angry with another person due to their actions or words. In this case, Sam is upset with Peter because he made fun of her insecurities, which led her to decide not to engage with him in a friendly manner anymore. This is similar to the target sentence where the person is upset with Kim for not supporting them at their wedding."

D. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.

Reasoning:

The target sentence expresses a negative feeling towards someone (Nick) due to an insulting incident. The most analogous sentence from the given options is D, as it also talks about a change from an unpleasant situation (stormy week) to a pleasant one. The other options do not share the same theme of negative feelings or changes in situations. 

Option A talks about someone's anger towards Kim for not supporting them at a wedding, which is a different context.

Option B talks about car malfunctioning and the importance of timely action, which is a different context and does not share the same negative feeling or change in situation as the target sentence.

Option C talks about personal preference for a color combination, which is a subjective matter and does not share the same negative feeling or change in situation as the target sentence."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person making a decision based on someone else's behavior. In this case, the person is holding a grudge against someone for not treating them with respect. This is similar to Sam's decision to stop engaging with Peter in a friendly manner after he made fun of her insecurities. Both sentences involve a person's actions being influenced by someone else's behavior."
182,Karen is upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.

Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence.
The target sentence is about Karen being upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.

Step 2: Analyze the options.
We need to find the option that is most similar in meaning or context to the target sentence.

Option A talks about a clerical error in a chemistry grade, which is not related to the context of the target sentence.

Option B talks about stamina in a competition, which is also not related to the context of the target sentence.

Option C talks about holding a grudge against someone for not treating them with respect, which is somewhat related to the context of the target sentence but not the most analogous.

Option D talks about being distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice in a book, which is not related to the context of the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
Out of all the options, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option C, as it also talks about holding a grudge against someone for not treating them with respect.

Answer: C."
183,Mary stopped talking to Amy because of the way she spoke to her last time.,"A. They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back.
B. Karen is upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.

D. Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.

Reasoning:

All the sentences in the options are analogous to the target sentence in the sense that they are expressing a cause-and-effect relationship between the way something is done (or written, or spoken) and the effect it has on the person experiencing it.

Option A talks about a contract and ideas, but it doesn't have the same cause-and-effect relationship as the target sentence.

Option B talks about a person's feelings and plans, but again, it doesn't have the same cause-and-effect relationship as the target sentence.

Option D talks about a person's reputation and the reality of their abilities, but it also doesn't have the same cause-and-effect relationship as the target sentence.

Option C, on the other hand, talks about a book's writing style and the reader's ability to learn from it, which is a direct cause-and-effect relationship, just like the target sentence. The peculiar grammar and word choice in the book distract the reader and prevent them from learning anything from it, which is the effect of the cause (the writing style)."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.

In this sentence, just as Lester made the dance team by the skin of his teeth, Peter managed to escape from the secret police by a narrow margin. The phrase ""albeit a bit close for comfort"" implies that the situation was precarious and Peter's escape was not without risk. This similarity in the sense of narrowly avoiding a negative outcome makes this sentence the most analogous to the target sentence."
185,"While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.","A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

In this sentence, the situation is similar to the target sentence in that it involves a successful accomplishment despite the odds being against it. The group managed to complete the project just in time, much like Peter managing to escape from the secret police. The use of ""just in time"" and ""two minutes before the deadline"" adds a sense of relief and narrow escape, similar to Peter's close call."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.

In this sentence, the person was in a difficult situation (slipping at the edge of the cliff), managed to avoid a disaster (holding onto the rock), and was saved just in time (before they fell). This is similar to the target sentence where the group managed to finish the project just in time before the deadline."
187,He made the final cut to the university just by a small margin.,"A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
B. Walter failed his exam, but his father only responded, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk,"" when he arrived.
C. The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.
D. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about someone making the final cut to the university by a small margin. This implies that the person barely made it, just in time, and it was a close call.

Option A talks about a group managing to finish a project just in time, right before the deadline. This is similar to the target sentence because it also talks about a close call, where the group barely made it in time.

Option B talks about someone failing an exam and their father's response. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a close call or a narrow margin.

Option C talks about a soccer club divided into groups of people from the same region. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a close call or a narrow margin.

Option D talks about someone letting off their rage and sitting down like a lamb. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a close call or a narrow margin."
188,He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.,"A. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",B,"
Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence and the given options.

The target sentence is about a person slipping at the edge of a cliff and managing to hold on to a rock to avoid falling. The options are four sentences with different meanings.

Step 2: Identify the most analogous sentence.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is the one that shares a similar theme or situation. In this case, the most analogous sentence is option A, which also talks about a person slipping at the edge of a cliff and holding on to a rock to avoid falling.

Step 3: Choose the correct letter.

The correct letter is A."
189,Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.,"A. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.

C. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
D. He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences describe a situation where the person had to accept something less desirable than what they wanted due to a lack of other options. In the target sentence, Philly won the game but the opponent was good and came close to victory, which means they didn't get the perfect outcome they wanted. In the analogous sentence, the person asked for a bicycle but received an old, rusty one, which is not what they would have chosen for themselves."
190,"Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.","A. To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.

C. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
D. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a task (teaching a class) that seems easy to do but is actually difficult to accomplish. It requires a lot of effort and commitment to do it well. The other options do not share this similarity with the target sentence."
191,It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.,"A. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a task (clearing the entrance exam) that appears easy but is actually quite challenging. It also highlights the importance of experience or skill (in this case, focus and discipline) in successfully completing the task."

B. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.
C. Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.
D. It takes a lot of effort to write a novel, so do not think writers do nothing worthy.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also highlights the misconception that something is easy and unworthy until one experiences it firsthand and realizes the effort and skill required. In this case, Victor initially thought acting was easy and unimportant until he participated in a theater class and discovered the complexity and value of the craft. Similarly, the target sentence emphasizes that writing a novel is not an easy task and should not be underestimated."
193,Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.,"A. By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.
B. Mary started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done.
C. It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.
D. He wanted to buy a big house and a car, but his father advised him to get a job first.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a situation where something appears simple or easy at first glance, but in reality, it is quite challenging and requires a certain level of skill or experience to master. In the target sentence, Victor initially thought acting was easy and useless, but after experiencing it firsthand, he realized it is an art form that requires a lot of skill and dedication to master. In the analogous sentence, driving in heavy traffic seems easy, but only experienced drivers can handle the complexities of navigating through the chaos."
194,To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.,"A. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.
B. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.
C. He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.
D. Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.

Reasoning:
The target sentence talks about the challenges and dedication required to teach a class of 10 students for the first time. Option A, ""Let Mike share the incident with you,"" also talks about a person who has gone through a challenging experience (sharing an incident) and needs to explain it well (dedication and preparation). This analogy is closer to the target sentence than the other options.

Option B talks about losing weight, which is a different topic and doesn't have the same theme as the target sentence.

Option C talks about a person being called on national television to talk about their crimes, which is a very different context and doesn't have any similarity with the target sentence.

Option D talks about a kid graduating from middle school, which is a happy occasion and doesn't have any similarity with the target sentence's theme of challenges and dedication."
195,It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.,"A. She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary.
B. A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.
C. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.
D. It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a situation where something appears to be simple or easy, but in reality, it requires a significant amount of skill or effort to accomplish successfully. The target sentence talks about the entrance exam, which may seem straightforward to some, but in reality, it requires a lot of focus and discipline to pass. Similarly, the sentence D talks about driving in heavy traffic, which may seem easy to some, but in reality, it requires a lot of experience and skill to navigate through the chaos."

C. There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.
D. Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. My sister cannot sleep in a dark room due to her fears, but she wants to challenge herself someday.

In this sentence, the subject is initially afraid of something (sleeping in a dark room), but despite this fear, they still want to challenge themselves to overcome it (sleeping in a dark room). This is similar to the target sentence, where the person is afraid of skydiving but still wants to try it once in their life. 

The other options are not analogous because they do not share the same theme of fear and the desire to overcome it. 

Option A talks about someone's position in a job, which is unrelated to fear and overcoming it. 

Option C talks about regret after an event (an interview), which is also unrelated to fear and overcoming it. 

Option D talks about a person going to a cabin to write a novel, which is not related to fear or overcoming it."

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence.
- The person is afraid of something (walking on the streets at night).
- They want to do it eventually.
- They will start doing it when they live alone.

Step 2: Analyze the options.
- A: The person is scared of something (speaking to strangers), but they want to do it eventually.
- B: This option is not analogous because it talks about greed and negotiations, not fear and courage.
- C: This option is not analogous because it talks about crying and greeting, not fear and courage.
- D: This option is not analogous because it talks about light from a candle, not fear and courage.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
- Option A is the most analogous because it also talks about a person being scared of something (speaking to strangers) but wanting to do it eventually."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in that it describes a person who is initially afraid or hesitant to do something, but then decides to face their fear and try it out. In this case, Sally is afraid of going to the gym and lifting weights, but she has recently shown interest and plans to start soon. This mirrors Sam's situation in the target sentence, where she is scared of speaking to strangers but wants to build up the courage to try it."
199,"Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.","A. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Sam is scared of speaking to strangers but she wants to build up the courage and try it out.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person having a fear (Sam's fear of speaking to strangers) and a desire to overcome that fear (Sam's desire to build up the courage and try it out). The sentence also follows a similar structure, with the first part stating the fear and the second part stating the desire to overcome it."
201,"Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.","A. Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.

D. All that glitters is not gold.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Frank has never tried to write a computer program before as he finds computers daunting. But last time we met, he said he will go for it.

In this sentence, Frank has a fear (like Sally's fear of lifting weights) of something (writing a computer program), but he has recently expressed a desire to overcome this fear and start doing it. This is similar to Sally's situation where she has never been to the gym due to fear but has recently shown interest and said she will start soon."

D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also describes a person who, after reaching a certain point in their life (in this case, feeling bored and tired with their job), decides to make a significant change and pursue a new path (opening a restaurant). This change is similar to Chris's decision to quit his job for his hobbies.

The other options do not share the same theme of a person making a significant change in their life due to dissatisfaction with their current situation. 

Option A describes a gradual process of melting a chocolate bar, which has no relation to the theme of the target sentence. 

Option B talks about a person's perception of their neighbor's home, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option D talks about a person collecting enough books to open a library, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence."

This sentence is similar to the target sentence because it also describes a person making a significant change in their career path. In the target sentence, Smith decides to leave his job as a lawyer and pursue a new passion for singing. In the analogous sentence, Emily decides to not pursue a job after graduation and instead chooses to travel and paint for enjoyment.

C. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
D. My mother had an important conference to prepare for, so she refused to entertain our day to day rants and fights.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.

The target sentence describes a person who has been working hard for weeks and is so exhausted that they decide to take a vacation. The analogous sentence describes a person who normally tries to maintain a good work-life balance but had to work non-stop due to multiple deadlines, leading to exhaustion. This is similar to the target sentence as both sentences describe a situation where a person has been working hard and is now exhausted, leading them to take a break."

B. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.
C. Sam is scared of speaking to strangers but she wants to build up the courage and try it out.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Emily's decision to not pursue a job after post-graduation and instead choose to travel and paint for enjoyment. Similarly, option D talks about Smith's decision to leave his job as a lawyer and pursue a different passion - singing - by creating a YouTube channel. Both sentences highlight a person choosing to follow their personal interests over traditional career paths.

Option A talks about someone being engrossed in their work and missing out on personal life and family, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option B talks about a person experiencing a sugar high and then falling asleep, which is not related to the target sentence at all.

Option C talks about a person being scared to speak to strangers but wanting to build up the courage, which is not directly related to the target sentence."
207,"When he finally started earning after years of struggle, Alex spent all his money on drinks and parties as he wanted to enjoy his life now.","A. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.

C. How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences convey the idea of not putting all your resources in one place, which can lead to loss or failure. In the target sentence, Alex spends all his money on drinks and parties, which could be seen as a risky move that may lead to financial instability. Similarly, in option A, investing all your money in the stock market is risky because if the stock market crashes, you could lose all your money. Therefore, it is important to diversify your investments, just as Alex should have diversified his spending."
208,The baby looks as snug as a bug in a rug next to her mother.,"A. I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.
B. Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.
C. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.
D. While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.",B,"
The target sentence is a metaphorical comparison between the baby and a bug in a rug, implying that the baby is comfortable and secure. 

Option A is not analogous because it talks about forgiveness and insult, which has no relation to the target sentence.

Option B is somewhat analogous as it also uses a comparison between a pet and its owner, but it's not as close as the other options.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about preparation and energy, which has no relation to the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about escaping from the secret police, which has no relation to the target sentence.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option B."

D. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him.

In this sentence, Linda's behavior changes when her husband is present, indicating that she feels comfortable and at ease in his company. Similarly, in the target sentence, Sally is happy and comfortable when Sharon is around. Both sentences show a positive change in behavior or emotions when the subject is with a specific person, emphasizing the comfort and familiarity they feel in their company."

D. You can't pour from an empty cup.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. You can't pour from an empty cup.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences convey the idea of needing to have something (or be in a certain state) before you can do something else. In the target sentence, Frank needs to have a good sleep before he can enjoy the familiarity of his home country. In the analogous sentence, you need to have a full cup before you can pour from it."

- she feels she can be her true self

Step 2: Analyze each option to find the most analogous one.

- This option does not reflect the same sentiment as the target sentence. It talks about Sally's feelings, but it does not mention any change in her demeanor or the presence of a significant other.

Option B: He obsesses over his previous girlfriend during the break.
- This option does not reflect the same sentiment as the target sentence. It talks about someone's behavior during a break, but it does not mention any change in demeanor or the presence of a significant other.

Option C: Kim checks papers in a rush to have more free time, but now needs to redo them.
- This option does not reflect the same sentiment as the target sentence. It talks about someone's actions and the consequences of those actions, but it does not mention any change in demeanor or the presence of a significant other.

Option D: The wife tells the husband that the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.
- This option does not reflect the same sentiment as the target sentence. It talks about someone's authority and the consequences of not following it, but it does not mention any change in demeanor or the presence of a significant other.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

The most analogous option to the target sentence is Option A, as it mentions a change in Sally's demeanor when Sharon is around, similar to how Linda's demeanor changes when her husband is around. However, since we are only asked to generate a letter, the correct answer is:

The target sentence talks about Sally's pet dog and its behavior, while the other options are not related to it. Option C talks about Jimmy's interaction with a professor, which is not directly related to the topic of the target sentence. However, it is the most analogous because it talks about a person (Jimmy) seeking advice or information from an expert (the professor) and receiving reassurance, which is somewhat similar to the dog's behavior of sitting next to Sally's father. The other options (A, B, D) are not analogous because they are not related to the topic of the target sentence or do not involve a similar situation."

- The target sentence talks about someone who argues on trivial matters and fails to see the bigger picture.

Step 2: Compare each option with the key elements and themes identified in the target sentence.

Option A: This sentence is about learning complex skills by starting with simpler tasks. It doesn't have the same theme of failing to see the bigger picture as the target sentence.

Option B: This sentence talks about focusing too much on the destination and not enjoying the journey. It shares the theme of failing to see the bigger picture, but the context is different.

Option C: This sentence talks about getting information directly from the source, but it doesn't have the same theme of failing to see the bigger picture.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also describes someone who is overly focused on a small detail (the doorknob) and is not considering the bigger picture (the entire house renovation). This is similar to the congressman in the target sentence who is so involved in the wording of his bill that he doesn't realize it will never pass."

The correct answer is: B. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.

Explanation:

The target sentence criticizes someone for focusing too much on a minor detail while ignoring the bigger picture. The sentence ""The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture"" highlights the person's obsession with a small detail (the doorknob) while the overall task (renovating the entire house) is being neglected.

Option A is not analogous because it talks about a person's guitar skills, which is not a minor detail in the context of a larger task.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about missing a bus and choosing to walk instead, which is not related to focusing on a minor detail while ignoring the bigger picture.

Option D talks about employees being let go if they don't agree with new policies, which is not related to focusing on a minor detail while ignoring the bigger picture."

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- The book's writing style
- Peculiar grammar and word choice

- Inability to learn from it

Step 2: Analyze the options and identify the one that best matches these elements:

Option B: This sentence talks about making do with the cold weather and building a fire instead of waiting for it to warm up. It doesn't relate to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option C: This sentence talks about Harry's tireless preparation for a final race and his dedication to training. It doesn't relate to the key elements of the target sentence.

Option D: This sentence talks about a congressman who became so involved in the wording of his bill that he didn't realize it would never pass. It relates to the key elements of the target sentence as it talks about someone being so focused on a detail (the wording of the bill) that they overlook the bigger picture (the bill's potential to pass).

Step 3: Choose the most analogous letter from the options:

The most analogous letter is D."

- Option B: A CEO's promises turning out to be empty words.
- Option C: Forgetting to experience the journey while focusing on reaching the destination.
- Option D: A person planning vacation but realizing they might not get leave.

Step 3: Compare the key elements with the target sentence.
- Option A and D are not analogous as they do not relate to the theme of work and personal life.
- Option B is not analogous as it talks about a CEO's promises being empty words, which is not related to the theme of work and personal life.
- Option C is analogous as it talks about focusing on the destination (reaching the goal) and missing out on the journey (personal life).

D. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. For not submitting her homework on time, Amy falsely made up an excuse that her dog ate it but the professor decided to penalize her.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about the importance of enjoying the journey while reaching a destination. It highlights the idea that people often focus so much on the end goal that they forget to appreciate the process or journey.

Option A is the most analogous because it also talks about the consequences of not focusing on the journey. In this case, Amy's focus was on not getting penalized for not submitting her homework, and she made up an excuse to avoid the punishment. This is similar to the target sentence's idea of focusing too much on the destination (avoiding the punishment) and forgetting the journey (submitting the homework).

Option B talks about a different situation where the reader's attention is distracted from the content of the book due to its peculiar grammar and word choice. This is not analogous to the target sentence as it does not involve the idea of focusing too much on the end goal and neglecting the journey.

Option C suggests forgetting a past event and working together on a project, which is not related to the idea of focusing too much on the destination and neglecting the journey.

Option D talks about John bringing out dishes and guests gathering around, which is not related to the idea of focusing too much on the destination and neglecting the journey."

Option C:
- Incomplete match. The key elements are not a direct match to the target sentence.

Option D:
- Complete match. The key elements are a direct match to the target sentence.

C. We all begin our lives as a baby and slowly learn and grow.
D. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Listen to the news straight from the horse’s mouth, his factory burned down right in front of his eyes.

This sentence is analogous because it also involves a first-hand account of an incident. In this case, the person who experienced the incident (the horse's mouth) is sharing their personal perspective and details about the event (the factory burning down). This is similar to the target sentence where Mike, who went through the incident, is sharing details with someone else."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a direct and personal account from the person involved in the situation.

The other options do not have the same direct and personal account element, making them less analogous."

D. He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.

Explanation:

The target sentence and the selected option (A) both follow a similar structure where an action is performed by a specific person (Sam in the target sentence, students in option A) when there is no one to supervise or control the situation. In the target sentence, Sam shares the story of the movie because she was the one who watched it. In option A, the students create a mess when there is no teacher to monitor them.

In both cases, the speaker is being misled or deceived by someone trying to sell them something."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it involves a person trying to sell something that is not what it seems to be. In the target sentence, Victor is trying to sell old coins as rare and valuable, while in option C, people are trying to sell cheap watches as expensive Rolexes. Both sentences involve deception and misrepresentation."

C. The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.
D. It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.

In this sentence, Victor, the music producer, is selecting something (old coins) that he may not like or value as much as others (you) and trying to sell it to someone (you) who may not appreciate its value as much as he does. This is similar to the target sentence where the music producer is selecting a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client."

C. Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.
D. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.",B,"
The correct answer is: C. Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a chef who chooses a simpler recipe for a less adventurous customer. The sentence is about making something easier for someone who is not willing to take risks.

Option A is about a picture being more effective than a warning message, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option B is about people trying to deceive others, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option D is about someone being reassured after consulting with a professor, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option C, on the other hand, is about someone finding comfort and familiarity in a place that reminds them of their childhood. This is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences are about making something easier or more comfortable for someone who is not willing to take risks or try new things."
232,"Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.","A. Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.
B. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention.
C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.
D. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.

Reasoning:

The target sentence and the given option A both convey the idea of prioritizing important tasks over less important ones. In the target sentence, the speaker is asking not to be disturbed because they have more important things to attend to. In option A, the speaker is suggesting to make the best of the current situation (cold weather) instead of waiting for it to improve. Both sentences imply the idea of focusing on what's most important at the moment and not being distracted by less important matters."
233,"Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention.","A. The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.
B. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.
C. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.
D. Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.

In this sentence, the doctor is focusing on an important task (the surgery) and doesn't want to be disturbed by minor tasks. Similarly, in the target sentence, Tom is focusing on an important event and doesn't want to be disturbed by meetings with others. Both sentences convey the idea of someone prioritizing a significant task and requesting not to be disturbed."
234,"Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.","A. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. My mother had an important conference to prepare for, so she refused to entertain our day to day rants and fights.
C. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.
D. The presentation was such a mess! The presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.

In this sentence, the person is expressing their fear of skydiving but also their intention to try it at least once. Similarly, in the target sentence, Ramos is expressing his decision to finish writing the novel over the weekend, despite any potential distractions. Both sentences convey a person's intention to take action despite their initial hesitation or fear."
235,"The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.","A. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
B. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.
C. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.
D. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is about the doctor who has an important surgery the next day and asks the staff not to interrupt him with any minor tasks. The sentence implies that the doctor is busy with something important and needs to focus on it without any distractions.

Option A is the most analogous because it also talks about someone who is busy with something important and doesn't want to be disturbed. The speaker in this sentence is asking not to be bothered with any calls because they have more important things to attend to. This is similar to the doctor's request to his staff not to interrupt him with minor tasks.

Option B talks about a friend who is drained after a day-long painting marathon and refuses to get up. While this sentence implies that the person is tired and needs rest, it doesn't convey the same sense of urgency and importance as the target sentence.

Option C talks about Rory seeing happiness on her mother's face when her brother calls after a long time. This sentence doesn't have any connection to the target sentence as it doesn't involve a request not to be disturbed or a sense of urgency.

Option D talks about a clerical error in someone's chemistry grade being changed from an A to a B. This sentence doesn't have any connection to the target sentence as it doesn't involve a request not to be disturbed or a sense of urgency."

C. Although he isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.
D. Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Philip focusing on a project for an entire day by switching off all his devices. Similarly, Ramos in option D is focusing on writing a novel over the weekend, and he goes to a cabin to avoid distractions. This is the most analogous option because it also talks about someone focusing on a task and avoiding distractions to complete it."
237,"My mother had an important conference to prepare for, so she refused to entertain our day to day rants and fights.","A. The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.
B. Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.
C. I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.
D. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also talks about a person who has an important event to prepare for and cannot be bothered with day-to-day matters. In this case, Tom is the person who has an important event to plan for and he is focusing all his attention on that. This is similar to the mother in the target sentence who is preparing for an important conference and doesn't want to be disturbed by day-to-day fights and rants."
238,"Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.","A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

C. Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.
D. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about Andy lying about being sick to avoid work and now being in trouble with his boss. Similarly, in option D, Philip is avoiding his chores by pretending to be busy, and when his mother finds out, he has to do all the chores he avoided. This is the most analogous to the target sentence as both sentences involve someone avoiding work or tasks by lying or pretending, and then facing consequences for their actions."

- Silvy is passing on her clients to other professionals
- She is showing up for tips
- The manager decides to fire her next time

Step 2: Analyze each option and determine which one has the most similar elements to the target sentence:

Option A: The opponents are unaware of my greatest asset, which is my stamina. The other runners have no chance at all!
- This sentence talks about an opponent's unawareness of the speaker's greatest asset, but it doesn't have any similarity to the target sentence.

Option B: Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.
- This sentence talks about an employee's absence from work and the consequences, but it doesn't have any similarity to the target sentence.

Option C: Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.
- This sentence talks about a person's awareness of their situation and their decision, but it doesn't have any similarity to the target sentence.

Option D: When Juli's favorite tree had fallen over, her father created a painting of it and said there was nothing else they could do.
- This sentence talks about a person's action after a tree fell, but it doesn't have any similarity to the target sentence.

Option A and Option D do not have any similarity to the target sentence. Option B and Option C have some elements that are not present in the target sentence. Therefore, the most analogous option is:

Option C: Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.

Step 4: Select the letter from the options:

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not the right choice as she had a lot of work to do.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person (Sally) realizing that they made a mistake (not doing their work) by following someone else's (her sister's) example. The sentence also includes a plan (Sally will have to work more) to correct the mistake. The other options do not share the same theme of realization, planning, and correction as the target sentence."

Step 2: Identify the key elements of the target sentence
- Philip avoided chores
- pretended to be busy
- mother realized he had no work
- made him do chores all week

242,"The group had lied about one of them being out of town to avoid the meeting, but the professor discerned the truth and decided to deduct marks on the project.","A. The manager saw that Silvy was passing on her clients for hair appointments to other professionals but was showing up for tips; she decided to fire her the next time.
B. She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?.
C. My sister cannot sleep in a dark room due to her fears, but she wants to challenge herself someday.
D. It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The manager saw that Silvy was passing on her clients for hair appointments to other professionals but was showing up for tips; she decided to fire her the next time.

In this sentence, there is a group (Silvy and other professionals) who are lying about their actions (passing on clients for personal gain) to avoid consequences (getting caught and fired). The manager, like the professor in the target sentence, discovers the truth and decides to take action (firing Silvy). This action is a form of punishment (deducting marks on the project) for the dishonesty."

C. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.
D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.

In this sentence, Philip is trying to avoid doing his chores by making an excuse (pretending to be busy), but his mother eventually finds out and makes him do the chores anyway. This is similar to the target sentence where Amy tries to avoid getting penalized for not submitting her homework on time by making an excuse (her dog ate it), but the professor sees through her excuse and decides to penalize her anyway.

The other options are not analogous because they do not involve someone making an excuse to avoid a consequence and the consequence still being applied. The lawyers at the business seminar are simply talking amongst themselves (A), the corporation is throwing more money at a problem (B), and you can't drive a car without fuel (D)."

D. Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. I do not want to spoil your mood but I have to babysit my nephew today.

In this sentence, the speaker is expressing a desire not to ruin someone's good mood or plans, but they have to do something that might do so. This is similar to the target sentence, where the person wants to avoid ruining their wife's parade, but they have to change their vacation plans. The other options do not have this same structure of wanting to avoid causing a negative outcome but being forced to do so."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also contains a piece of unpleasant news that the recipient has to hear before they can proceed with their plans. In the target sentence, the recipient is informed that their A in chemistry was a clerical error, which means they have to redo their work. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, the recipient is informed that they have to present their work before they can go on vacation, which means they have to delay their plans. Both sentences convey a sense of disappointment or inconvenience that the recipient has to face before they can move forward with their plans."
246,I'm sorry to disappoint you but you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist!.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.

D. The doctor had an important surgery the next day, so he asked the staff to not interrupt him with any minor tasks.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.

The target sentence expresses surprise and frustration at someone not recognizing the significance of a person's status or achievement. The option B sentence also conveys a similar sentiment, with the speaker expressing disbelief at the fact that the person is not recognized as the ""god of rap"" despite winning three Grammy awards. The other options do not share the same level of surprise or frustration, and do not have a similar context or tone to the target sentence."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive.

The target sentence is a statement of surprise and disbelief, emphasizing the importance of the person being referred to. The options A, B, and C do not convey this same sentiment and are not analogous to the target sentence. Option D, on the other hand, also expresses surprise and emphasizes the importance of the person being referred to (Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest football players alive)."

- Option A talks about fear and skydiving.
- Option B talks about respect and a professor.
- Option C talks about the life of royals and its appearance.
- Option D talks about a defense lawyer and an eyewitness.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.

Reasoning:

The target sentence is a statement of admiration and respect towards someone who is highly respected in their field. The speaker is emphasizing the importance and reverence of the person being addressed.

Option A is a sentence about a father's strictness towards his son. It does not share the same theme of respect or admiration as the target sentence.

Option B is a sentence about a poorly organized presentation. It does not share the same theme of respect or admiration as the target sentence.

Option D is a sentence about someone who has skipped work and is in trouble with their boss. It does not share the same theme of respect or admiration as the target sentence.

Option C, on the other hand, is a sentence that praises someone who has achieved great success in their field (winning three Grammy awards) and is considered highly by others (people consider him to be the god of rap). This sentence shares the same theme of respect and admiration as the target sentence."

The target sentence expresses a high level of surprise or astonishment at someone's achievement or status, while the options A, B, and C do not share the same level of surprise or exclamation. Option D, on the other hand, also expresses a high level of surprise or astonishment at someone's status or position, making it the most analogous to the target sentence."
255,Do you know who you're facing? That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
C. A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.
D. We missed the bus, but it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.

This is because both sentences are direct statements that reveal a significant fact about a person or thing. The target sentence reveals that the person being addressed is facing the world champion of taekwondo, while the given sentence reveals that the person being addressed should be aware that the person in question is the president of the United States. Both sentences are direct, assertive, and informative, making them analogous to each other."

C. Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.
D. Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person who is aware of a situation but has chosen to ignore it or not take action. In this case, Sally is aware of her situation with Scott, but she has chosen to stay with him despite the circumstances. This is similar to the target sentence where the woman is aware that the man is lying to her, but she has chosen to ignore it and continue the relationship."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person who is aware of a problem (the professor knowing the students copied the homework) but chooses not to focus on it (deciding not to be strict about it). The other options do not have this same structure. Option A talks about the consequences of not studying for a test, option B talks about people's lack of commitment to weight loss, and option D talks about a person opening the window blinds to let in sunlight."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.

In this sentence, the person initially appears to be unaware or unsure of their abilities (like Sally in the target sentence), but they eventually decide to pursue their situation (like Sally deciding to be with Scott) despite the circumstances (like the challenges in Sally's situation with Scott)."
259,"He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.","A. John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.

C. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.
D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.",B,"
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the target sentence:
- The person knows something about Rick (not a good friend, only after money)
- The person chooses to get along with Rick despite this knowledge
- The reason for this choice is for the time being

Step 2: Analyze each option:
- Option A: The sentence talks about John's wealth and loneliness, but there is no mention of John knowing something about John and choosing to be with someone despite this knowledge.
- Option B: The sentence talks about the professor knowing something about the students (copying homework) but choosing not to be strict, but there is no mention of the reason for this choice being for the time being.
- Option C: The sentence talks about preferring familiar things over new ones, but there is no mention of anyone knowing something about someone else and choosing to be with them despite this knowledge.
- Option D: The sentence talks about someone doing something instead of their friend, but there is no mention of the reason for this choice being for the time being.

Step 3: Choose the option that best matches the key elements of the target sentence.

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.

Reasoning:

The target sentence and the selected option both involve a person who is aware of a situation but decides not to take strict action against it. In the target sentence, the professor knows that the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it. In the selected option, the person knows that someone is lying to them, but they choose to ignore it.

The other options do not share the same theme. Option B talks about fear and future actions, Option C talks about a person's demeanor changing around someone, and Option D talks about the temporary nature of a seasonal occurrence. None of these options directly relate to the theme of being aware of a situation and choosing not to take strict action against it."

- Analogy: This sentence has a similar contrast between what is said and what is actually happening, but it is not as direct as the target sentence.

Option C: Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.
- Key elements: Monica, cooked, food, restaurant, leave, rest
- Analogy: This sentence has a different contrast between what is said and what is actually happening. It does not have the same level of contrast as the target sentence.

Option D: Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
- Key elements: president, United States
- Analogy: This sentence does not have a similar contrast between what is said and what is actually happening.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option:

C. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about the contrast between the online appearance of a strong friendship and the reality of a weak bond. Similarly, option A talks about the contrast between the time taken to send a letter and the fact that it was sent. Both sentences highlight a difference between an appearance and the actual reality."
265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","A. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.
B. Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.
C. The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.
D. You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. He never told her about his feelings but every time he met her, he was caring towards her.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a person's skills being poorly expressed but showing through their actions. Similarly, option A talks about a person's feelings not being expressed but showing through their actions. Both sentences highlight a contrast between what is said and what is shown through actions."
266,Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.,"A. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.
B. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.
C. I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.
D. All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence and identify the key elements.

The target sentence is about Garry talking about how he manages work stress, but his behavior (smoking) contradicts his words.

Step 2: Identify the key elements in each option.

A. Parents talking about their parenting, but their actions contradict their words.
B. Parents living happily after deciding not to divorce.
C. Someone determined to complete a task (spreadsheets) but their actions might not align with their words.
D. A collection of songs that are generally good, but one song ruins the overall vibe.

Step 3: Choose the option that best matches the key elements of the target sentence.

Option A is the most analogous as it also involves a discrepancy between what someone says and what they do."
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.
C. Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.

In this sentence, the speaker is describing someone who doesn't explicitly express their feelings but still shows care through their actions. Similarly, in the target sentence, Peter's parents don't claim to be good parents, but they spend quality time with their children, demonstrating their good parenting.

The other options are not analogous because they don't share the same theme of contrast between what is said and what is shown through actions. 

Option A talks about the negative effects of smoking, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence. 

Option B talks about someone who failed repeatedly but finally succeeded, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option C talks about someone who skipped work and is in trouble with their boss, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence."
268,A forest grew near the river.,"A. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
B. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.
C. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
D. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""A forest grew near the river"" is option A: ""After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.""

This is because both sentences describe a process of growth or development over time. In the target sentence, a forest grows near a river, while in option A, Tim grows and learns from his disappointment to work harder for his goal. Both sentences also involve a change or progression from one state to another. The forest grows from seeds, and Tim grows from his disappointment to a more determined state. 

The other options do not share the same analogy with the target sentence. Option B talks about continuing to water a garden despite rain being forecasted, which does not involve growth or development. Option C compares the usefulness of a map versus instructions, which does not involve growth or development. Option D describes John bringing out dishes for guests, which does not involve growth or development."
269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"A. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.
D. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about many students coming to study under the guru. This implies that the students are seeking knowledge and guidance from the guru. Similarly, in option A, Sally is gathering strength to support her parents, indicating that she is seeking to provide emotional support and guidance to them during a difficult time. This is analogous to the students seeking knowledge from the guru. 

Option B talks about attacking points in an argument, which is not similar to the target sentence. 

Option C talks about being distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice in a book, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about Andy opening the window blinds to see the sun rising, which is not similar to the target sentence as it does not involve a group of people seeking knowledge or guidance from someone."
270,"John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.","A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
B. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.
C. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.
D. When Juli's favorite tree had fallen over, her father created a painting of it and said there was nothing else they could do.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.

This sentence describes a situation where one thing (cheap watches being passed off as expensive Rolexes) is being introduced or brought out (into the market or to potential buyers), and as a result, people are drawn to it (due to the deception or the perceived value). This is similar to the target sentence, where John is bringing out dishes onto the dining room table, which attracts the guests."
271,Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.,"A. A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.
B. I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.
C. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",A,"
Step 1: Identify the main idea of the target sentence.
The main idea of the target sentence is that Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the target sentence.
The key elements in the target sentence are:
- Mary collected books
- over the years
- enough books to make a library

Step 3: Analyze the options.
Option A talks about a community growing outside the city center, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.
Option B talks about eating leftover rice, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.
Option C talks about sharing an incident with someone, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.
Option D talks about someone being caring towards someone else, which is not related to the key elements of the target sentence.

Step 4: Choose the most analogous option.
The most analogous option is Option A as it talks about something growing or accumulating over time, which is similar to the key elements of the target sentence."
272,Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.,"A. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

C. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.
D. Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

Explanation:

The target sentence and the given option A both describe a gradual change from a state of darkness or emptiness to a state of light or fullness. In the target sentence, the dark room becomes brightly lit as the sun rises. In option A, the dining room becomes filled with dishes as John brings them out one by one, and the guests begin to gather around. Both sentences follow a cause-and-effect structure where an action (opening the blinds or bringing out dishes) leads to a change in the state of the environment (brightening the room or filling the dining room)."
273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"A. A forest grew near the river.
B. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.
C. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence to understand its main idea and context.
The target sentence talks about a large suburban community that has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.

Step 2: Compare each option with the target sentence.

A. A forest grew near the river.
This sentence talks about the growth of a forest near a river, which is not related to the development of a suburban community.

B. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.
This sentence talks about a person's emotional change from crying to being cheerful, which is not related to the development of a suburban community.

C. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
This sentence talks about a person's reaction to a cleaned floor, which is not related to the development of a suburban community.

D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.
This sentence talks about a military situation where soldiers are being used in a fight, which is not related to the development of a suburban community.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.

Out of all the options, option A is the most analogous to the target sentence as it talks about the growth of something (a forest) outside a specific location (a river). Similarly, the target sentence talks about the growth of a suburban community outside the city center."
274,Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.,"A. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.
B. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.

In this sentence, the situation is similar to the target sentence in that there is a specific item (the bicycle) being provided, and the person receiving it has no other choice but to use it. Just as the blades of grass in the target sentence are being used as weapons, the old, rusty bicycle is being used as a means of transportation, despite its less-than-ideal condition. The other options do not have this same level of comparison to the target sentence."
275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"A. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
B. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.
C. You can't write from an inkless pen.
D. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""C. You can't write from an inkless pen.""

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences convey a direct, straightforward message about the impossibility of a certain action. The target sentence states that smoking cigarettes is a threat to one's health, and the given sentence states that an inkless pen cannot write. Both sentences are clear and straightforward, without any hidden meanings or complex ideas.

Option A is not analogous because it talks about a person not mentioning something to another person, which is a different concept from the direct statement in the target sentence.

Option B is not analogous because it talks about challenged ideas, which is a different concept from the direct statement in the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about parents being good despite not being seen as such, which is a different concept from the direct statement in the target sentence."
276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"A. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.
C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.",B,"
Step 1: Understand the target sentence
The target sentence is ""He attacked every point in my argument."" It means that someone is refuting or countering every point made in someone else's argument.

Step 2: Analyze the options
We have four options to choose from. Let's analyze each one:

Option A: ""It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.""
This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about using a map versus reading instructions, which is a different context.

Option B: ""He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.""
This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about someone physically hammering a nail into a wall, which is a different action and context.

Option C: ""After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.""
This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about someone giving advice after seeing someone's disappointment, which is a different context.

Option D: ""Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.""
This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about someone being drained after a long painting session, which is a different context.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option
None of the options are analogous to the target sentence. Therefore, none of the options can be chosen as the most analogous sentence."
277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.
C. She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.
D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence is about strong winds causing damage to the cables supporting a cellphone tower.

Step 2: Analyze the options
Option A talks about waves battering a rock, which is a forceful action.
Option B talks about a chef choosing a simpler recipe for a less adventurous customer, which is not related to the target sentence.
Option C talks about a person working hard and then taking a vacation, which is not related to the target sentence.
Option D talks about a person collecting books and making a library, which is not related to the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option
Option A is the most analogous to the target sentence as it also involves a forceful action causing damage.

Answer: A"
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.
B. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
C. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.
D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""A succession of waves battered the rock"" is:

A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.

Explanation:

The target sentence and the selected option (A) both have a similar structure and meaning. 

In the target sentence, ""A succession of waves battered the rock,"" the phrase ""a succession of"" indicates a series of events that follow each other in order. The verb ""battered"" indicates a continuous and forceful action. 

In the selected option (A), ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error,"" the phrase ""I hate to inform you"" indicates a negative message that the speaker is reluctant to deliver. The verb ""was actually"" indicates a change in the original status, and ""a clerical error"" is a mistake made by someone in a position of trust.

Both sentences have a clear and straightforward structure, with a subject (waves, your A in chemistry) and an action (battered, was actually). They both also convey a specific message or information. 

The other options (B, C, D) do not have a similar structure or meaning to the target sentence. Option B talks about not wanting to be disturbed, option C talks about throwing more money to fix a problem, and option D talks about people socializing together. None of these sentences convey a series of events or a change in status like the target and selected sentences."
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"A. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.
D. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.

Reasoning:

The target sentence describes a series of unfortunate events that have negatively impacted the production of a play. Similarly, option A talks about someone who is not confident in their abilities (speaking about his guitar skills poorly), but when they actually perform (when he played), their hard work and effort are evident in the outcome (the music he produced). This analogy highlights the contrast between expectation and reality, much like the target sentence.

Option B talks about attacking points in an argument, which is not analogous to the target sentence as it does not involve a series of unfortunate events.

Option C talks about receiving recognition and promotion, which is not analogous as it is a positive outcome and the target sentence involves a series of unfortunate events.

Option D talks about someone managing work stress but having a different story told by their constant need for smoking, which is not analogous as it does not involve a series of unfortunate events."
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"A. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.
B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.",D,"
The correct answer is B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about how several risky fiscal policies combined to cause an economic depression. This is similar to how the actions of the politician in option B (After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election) led to a desired outcome (winning the election) after a long and difficult process."
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.",A,"
The correct answer is:

D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a corporation adding more resources to solve a problem. Similarly, in option D, Harry put in all his effort and energy into his training for the final race. Both sentences convey the idea of adding more resources or effort to achieve a goal."
282,He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.,"A. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.
B. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
C. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.
D. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer"" is option A: ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.""

This is because both sentences involve a direct action (knocking a nail into a wall or investing money in the stock market) that requires a tool (a hammer or a financial investment strategy) and carries a risk (knocking the nail too hard or investing all your money in one stock). The advice given in both sentences is to avoid putting all your resources in one place, as this can lead to potential harm or loss."
283,Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.,"A. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.
D. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.",A,"
Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence.
The target sentence is about someone's ideas being challenged as they read multiple books.

Step 2: Analyze the options.
Option A talks about wind snapping cables, Option B talks about an inkless pen, Option C talks about taking longer time to finish a training program, and Option D talks about Samantha's savings and flight tickets.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option.
Option A and Option C are not analogous as they talk about different subjects and actions. Option B is not analogous as it talks about a pen without ink. Option D is not analogous as it talks about a financial advice.

Step 4: Choose the most analogous option.
The most analogous option is Option A as it talks about something being challenged (cables) as a result of reading (books).

Answer: A."
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"A. Lets meet him and ask about the robbery. Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear.
B. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""It's hard to love with a broken heart"" is option D. ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""

Both sentences express a situation where something is impossible or challenging due to a lack of a necessary component. In the target sentence, loving someone is difficult when one's heart is broken, implying emotional pain or hurt. In option D, driving a car is impossible without fuel, which is a crucial component for the vehicle to function.

The other options do not share the same theme or connection with the target sentence. Option A talks about meeting someone and discussing a robbery, option B mentions a person not mentioning a borrowed item, and option C mentions the president of the United States. None of these sentences convey the same idea as the target sentence about the difficulty of an action due to a lack of a necessary component."
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.
B. Sachin is said to be the best cricketer in the world, but like every other player, he had to retire.
C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""one can't eat from a broken plate.""

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also describes a situation where something that is supposed to serve a certain function (eating from a plate) can no longer do so due to a problem (the plate being broken). The target sentence talks about a cup that can no longer contain its coffee, and the given sentence talks about a broken plate that can no longer be used for eating. Both sentences highlight the inability of the object to fulfill its intended purpose due to a defect or damage."
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
C. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""You can't pour from an empty cup"" is ""one can't eat from a broken plate."" 

This is because both sentences convey the idea that something cannot be done with a certain object due to its state or condition. In the target sentence, you can't pour from an empty cup because there's nothing to pour. In the analogous sentence, you can't eat from a broken plate because it's not in a usable state. Both sentences emphasize the importance of having the necessary resources or conditions for an action to be performed."
287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"A. The A team is the best one as it has the best players except Ron, who often negates the others' efforts.
B. one can't eat from a broken plate.
C. I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive.
D. If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.",B,"
Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence.
The target sentence is ""A fallen tree cannot provide shade."" It means that a tree that has fallen down cannot give shade because it is no longer standing.

Step 2: Analyze the options.
We have four options: A, B, C, and D. Each option is a sentence that we need to compare with the target sentence to find the most analogous one.

Option A: ""The A team is the best one as it has the best players except Ron, who often negates the others' efforts."" This sentence is about a team and its players, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B: ""one can't eat from a broken plate."" This sentence is about a broken plate, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C: ""I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive."" This sentence is about a person, Cristiano Ronaldo, and not related to the target sentence.

Option D: ""If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one."" This sentence is about a computer and its malfunction, which is not related to the target sentence.

Step 3: Choose the most analogous option.
From the analysis, we can see that option D is the most analogous to the target sentence because it talks about something that is no longer functional (a broken computer) and cannot provide a service (fixing a malfunction).

Answer: D"
288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.
B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.
D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences convey the idea of something that was once capable of performing a certain function (the cup holding coffee, the candle providing light) but is no longer able to do so due to a certain condition (the cup being broken, the candle being unlit)."
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"A. He attacked every point in my argument.
B. It's hard to love with a broken heart.
C. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence ""You can't write from an inkless pen"" is ""Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.""

The target sentence is a metaphorical statement that emphasizes the importance of having the necessary tools or resources to perform a task. In this case, you cannot write with a pen that has no ink. The ink is the essential resource for writing, just as the pen is the tool.

Option A, ""He attacked every point in my argument,"" is not analogous because it talks about attacking an argument, which is a different concept from using a tool for a task.

Option B, ""It's hard to love with a broken heart,"" is not analogous because it talks about the difficulty of performing an emotional action, not using a tool for a task.

Option D, ""The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students,"" is not analogous because it talks about the success of explaining a topic, not the necessity of a tool for a task."
290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",B,"
Step 1: Understand the structure of the target sentence and the options.
The target sentence is a statement that two things cannot be done together, i.e., driving a car without fuel. The options are four sentences that follow a similar structure.

Step 2: Analyze each option.

A. This sentence compares the ability to understand something from a drawing versus a book. It's not related to the target sentence's structure.

B. This sentence talks about the inability to write with a pen that has no ink. It's similar to the target sentence's structure.

C. This sentence talks about a person's energy level after consuming sugar. It's not related to the target sentence's structure.

D. This sentence talks about a person's career change from a lawyer to a YouTuber. It's not related to the target sentence's structure.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option.

B. You can't write from an inkless pen.

This option is the most analogous to the target sentence because it also talks about the inability to do something with an essential component missing."
291,one can't eat from a broken plate.,"A. You can't write from an inkless pen.
B. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.
C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
D. He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees.",A,"
Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence is ""one can't eat from a broken plate."" It conveys the idea that one cannot perform an action (eating) from a damaged or unusable object (a broken plate).

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the target sentence
- The action (eating)
- The object (a plate)
- The condition (broken)

Step 3: Identify the key elements in each option
- Option A: The action (writing)
- Option B: The action (walking)
- Option C: The action (supporting)
- Option D: The action (arguing)

Step 4: Compare the key elements in each option with the target sentence
- Option A: The action (writing) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option B: The action (walking) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option C: The action (supporting) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option D: The action (arguing) is not related to the target sentence.

Step 5: Select the option with the most analogous key elements
- Option A: The action (writing) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option B: The action (walking) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option C: The action (supporting) is not related to the target sentence.
- Option D: The action (arguing) is not related to the target sentence.

Step 6: Choose the most analogous letter from the given options

Answer: There is no analogous sentence in the given options."
292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
B. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.
D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.",A,"
The answer is: A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option A because it also describes a process happening gradually, step by step. In the target sentence, water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe, which is a slow and continuous process. Similarly, in option A, the heat from the stove is melting the chocolate bar over time, also a gradual process."
293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.
B. He was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer.
C. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.
D. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.",A,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.

In this sentence, the large beaker represents Lake Erie, the smaller beaker represents Lake Ontario, and the narrow pipe represents the Niagara River. Just as water flows from the larger beaker to the smaller one through the pipe, Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River."
294,The parent tries to instill bits of knowledge in their child by simple communication.,"A. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.

C. When Chris turned forty, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job for his hobbies.
D. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.",B,"
The correct answer is: 

A. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option A because it also involves a person (the parent) trying to impart knowledge or skills to another person (the child or daughter). In this case, the daughter is causing problems when she has nothing else to do, similar to how the parent in the target sentence is trying to instill bits of knowledge in their child through simple communication. The phrase ""an idle brain is the devil's workshop"" also relates to the idea of using time productively, which is a key aspect of the target sentence."
295,"Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.","A. Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.
B. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.
C. Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.
D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.",C,"
Step 1: Read and understand the target sentence and the options.

The target sentence talks about how the heat from a stove is gradually melting a chocolate bar placed nearby.

The options are:
- A: Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.
- B: Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.
- C: Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.
- D: It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.

Step 2: Identify the most analogous sentence.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is the one that shares a similar structure or pattern of events. In this case, the most analogous sentence is the one that talks about something happening gradually or step by step.

Step 3: Choose the correct letter.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option D: It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one. This sentence talks about a gradual process of applying to multiple companies, which is similar to the gradual process of the stove's heat melting the chocolate bar.

Answer: D"
296,Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.,"A. Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.
B. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.

D. Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.

The target sentence and the analogous sentence both convey a sense of receiving support or resources from a larger entity, whether it's the federal government providing funding for a state budget or a group working together on a project. In both cases, the smaller entity (the state or the individual) benefits from the larger entity (the federal government or the group)."
297,My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.,"A. Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.
B. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.

Key elements in the target sentence:
- Tiny daily coffee expenses
- Draining up all my income

Key elements in the options:
- Victor from school trying to sell old coins

C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.
D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry."
299,The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go.,"A. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.

C. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.
D. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.",D,"
The correct answer is: D. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

The sentence that is most analogous to the target sentence is D. This is because all three sentences have a similar structure and tone. They all convey a clear message or ultimatum, and the consequences of not complying with the message are stated. 

In the target sentence, the management is making it clear that the employees must agree with the new policies or they will be fired. In option D, the wife is stating that if the family does not eat what she cooks, they will go hungry. This is similar to the management's ultimatum, where if the employees do not comply, they will be let go. 

Option A talks about weight loss, which is not related to the management's ultimatum. Option B talks about Monica cooking too much food, which is not an ultimatum or a message with consequences. Option C talks about using a pen for gossip and rumors, which is not related to the management's ultimatum."

The correct answer is:

C. The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about the wife asserting her authority in the kitchen and the family's compliance with her decisions. The most analogous sentence in the given options is C, which also involves a person or group being required to comply with a certain condition or face consequences. In this case, the management is making it clear to the employees that they must agree with the new policies or face the possibility of being fired. This is similar to the wife's ultimatum to the family, where they must eat what she prepares or go hungry. The other options do not share this same level of authority and consequences, making option C the most analogous to the target sentence."
301,The technical lead informed the team that they have to follow his ideas for the project to be completed without question or risk failure.,"A. You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.
B. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.

A. You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.

Explanation:

The target sentence is a directive given by the technical lead to the team, emphasizing the importance of following his ideas for the successful completion of the project. The sentence conveys a sense of urgency and the potential consequences of not adhering to the instructions.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also involves a directive or advice given with a sense of urgency and potential consequences. In this case, the advice is about seeking medical attention earlier, which could have led to a better outcome. The sentence structure and the use of ""should have"" and ""still could have"" convey a similar message to the target sentence, making it the most analogous option."
302,I told my wife I will compromise on most of the things but on holidays I can do whatever I want.,"A. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.
B. Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.
C. The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",A,"
Step 1: Understand the target sentence

Step 2: Analyze the options
Option A talks about the wife's control over the kitchen, Option B talks about Philip's focus, Option C talks about students' behavior, and Option D talks about a broken plate.

Step 3: Identify the most analogous option
Option D is the most analogous to the target sentence as it also talks about maintaining independence in a specific aspect (eating from a broken plate).

The letter corresponding to Option D is D."
303,"If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit.","A. The father told the son that it was his way or the highway when the son came back home drunk.
B. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.
C. A succession of waves battered the rock.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",A,"
The correct answer is [C] A succession of waves battered the rock.

Rationale:
The target sentence is a conditional statement that presents a choice for workers: they can either work for 20 hours a week or choose to quit. The sentence is straightforward and presents a clear consequence for not meeting the requirement.

Option [A] is not analogous because it involves a different context (father-son relationship and alcohol consumption) and a different tone (authoritative vs. conditional).

Option [B] is not analogous because it talks about collecting books and creating a library, which is a different topic and context from the target sentence.

Option [D] is not analogous because it talks about a teacher successfully explaining a complex topic to students, which is a different scenario and context from the target sentence.

Option [C] is the most analogous because it presents a succession of events (waves battering a rock) and a consequence (the rock being affected by the waves). This is similar to the target sentence, which presents a condition (working for 20 hours a week) and a consequence (quitting)."
304,"Every evening, many drinkers get together in a bar near our home. You know, birds of a feather flock together.","A. We all begin our lives as a baby and slowly learn and grow.

C. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.
D. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.",B,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about people gathering together based on a common interest (drinking) and the proverb ""birds of a feather flock together"" being applicable. 

Option B also talks about people gathering together based on a common interest (soccer) and practicing often with each other. This is similar to the target sentence as it also talks about people coming together due to a shared interest and regularly interacting with each other. 

The other options do not share the same theme of people gathering together due to a common interest and regular interaction. Option A talks about the growth and learning process of individuals, option C discusses commitment and weight loss, and option D talks about the happiness on a mother's face upon hearing from her son."
305,I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.,"A. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.

D. The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.",C,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because both sentences express the idea of enjoying learning from others who have knowledge or experience in a particular subject. In the first sentence, the speaker is saying that even if you don't like your current job, you should not quit without finding a better one because you can learn from others who have more experience or knowledge in the field. Similarly, in the target sentence, the speaker is saying that they enjoy talking to people who know about computers because they can learn more about the subject. Both sentences emphasize the importance of learning from others who have expertise in a particular area."
306,"The fancy Michelin-star restaurant seems to attract a homogeneous clientele, who all appear to wear the same fashion and be around the same age.","A. Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.

C. Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.
D. A soft breeze blew after the gust of wind shook down the shacks.",B,"
The correct answer is:

A. Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option A because both sentences discuss a specific group or category (in the target sentence, it's a homogeneous clientele, and in option A, it's part of the state budget) that is composed of similar elements (in the target sentence, they all wear the same fashion and are around the same age, and in option A, they come from the federal government's spending package). Additionally, both sentences describe these elements as being distinct or unique in some way (in the target sentence, it's the fancy Michelin-star restaurant, and in option A, it's the federal government's contentious spending package)."
307,The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves.,"A. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.

C. The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.
D. After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.",C,"
The correct answer is: A. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option A because it also involves a group of individuals (Sally) interacting and discussing something amongst themselves (her religious beliefs). The sentence also conveys a sense of determination and conviction, as Sally is adamant about her beliefs and goes through with the ceremony despite any opposition or challenges. This is similar to the target sentence where the lawyers are discussing and sharing their thoughts and ideas amongst themselves."

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about the importance of understanding others' perspectives before taking a stand, as one may not know who will support or harm them. Option C also discusses the importance of gathering information from different people before making a decision, in this case, the father is hesitant to buy a house due to rumors of it being haunted. The father is cautious and wants to gather more opinions before making a decision, which is analogous to the target sentence's message of gauging others before taking a stand."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a decision made based on external factors. In the target sentence, the father decides to wait to buy the house because he wants to take more opinions from different people. In the given sentence, the decision is made not to take too much work this quarter because the performance won't impact appraisals. Both sentences involve a decision based on external factors, and both sentences involve a delay in taking action."

In this sentence, the person is making a decision about investing (selling shares) based on the current situation (market is low), but the speaker is advising them to wait and consider the future possibilities (shares may rebound). Similarly, in the target sentence, Gary is investing in a garden during the off-season, regretting that he didn't start earlier when the results would be more visible. The advice given is to plan and start during the spring and summer season, considering the future possibilities of better results."

D. The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.

The target sentence is advising someone not to overwork in the current quarter because the performance won't affect the appraisals. Instead, it suggests working more in the next two quarters when the management will prioritize it. This is similar to the given sentence, which talks about a charming CEO who turned out to be the wrong choice, and his promises were only empty words. Both sentences convey a message about something that initially seemed promising but turned out to be untrue or not as beneficial as expected."

Option A and D both advise against making hasty decisions without considering all options.
Option B advises planning and starting at the right time for better results, which is similar to the target sentence advice of waiting for a better time to make a purchase.
Option C does not contain any advice related to the target sentence.

The target sentence talks about Sandy being the only one who doesn't show up to the dance class, and this causes a problem because one of them is always without a partner. In the same way, in option B, Jim is the only one from their group who has engaged in criminal activity, which is causing a problem for the rest of the group. The sentence highlights that Jim is the only one who has spent time in jail, which is a significant consequence of his actions. This similarity in structure and context makes option B the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Step 1: Understand the target sentence and the options.
The target sentence is about someone talking negatively about others and not feeling sorry when their secrets are revealed. The options are sentences with different topics and situations.

Step 2: Identify the most analogous sentence.
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is the one that shares a similar theme or situation.

Step 3: Analyze each option.
Option A talks about a congressman and a bill, which is not related to the target sentence.
Option B talks about a stove and a chocolate bar, which is not related to the target sentence.
Option C talks about a boy who cried wolf, which is not related to the target sentence.
Option D talks about someone's perception of a man's attractiveness, which is not related to the target sentence.

Step 4: Choose the most analogous letter.
The most analogous letter is the one that represents the sentence most closely related to the target sentence.

Answer: C. The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.

Step 5: Provide a justification for the answer.
The justification for choosing option C is that it shares a similar theme with the target sentence. Both sentences involve someone's actions leading to consequences. In the target sentence, the person talking trash about others faces no consequences, while in option C, the boy who cried wolf faces consequences when the wolf really comes."
333,The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.,"A. He is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.
B. The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.
C. How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?.
D. The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other.",C,"
The correct answer is:

A. He is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.

Reasoning:

The target sentence talks about a boy who repeatedly cried wolf until the actual wolf arrived, and he faced the consequences. The sentence implies that the boy's actions led to his own downfall.

Option A is the most analogous because it talks about someone who is so focused on one aspect of their life (work) that they are neglecting other important aspects (personal life and family). This is similar to the boy in the target sentence who was so focused on crying wolf that he didn't realize the real danger until it was too late.

Option B talks about the seemingly perfect life of a celebrity, but the hidden problems they face. While this is a contrast to the target sentence, it does not have the same theme of consequences for past actions.

Option C talks about someone who didn't study for a test and is likely to fail. While this sentence has a similar theme of consequences for actions, it doesn't have the same cause-and-effect relationship as the target sentence.

Option D talks about countries deciding to maintain friendly relations after a war. This sentence has no similarity to the target sentence in terms of cause-and-effect or consequences for actions."
334,"She wanted to buy a dress in case someone asked her to the dance, but I told her not to count her chickens before they hatched.","A. My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.

C. A fallen tree cannot provide shade.
D. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.",D,"
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a person who wants to buy a dress in case someone asks her to a dance, but is advised not to count her chickens before they hatch. This means that she should not assume that she will be asked to the dance and should not buy the dress until she has received an invitation.

Option D is the most analogous because it also involves a person looking forward to something (meeting his favorite author) but not having received an invitation yet. It also involves the idea of not counting chickens before they hatch, as Larry is advised to wait for the invitation before getting excited.

Option A talks about daily coffee expenses, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option B talks about driving a car in heavy traffic, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option C talks about a fallen tree not providing shade, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence."

Both sentences have a similar structure and convey a similar situation where a person's desire is not immediately fulfilled due to an obstacle."

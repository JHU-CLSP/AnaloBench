Option D describes a similar situation where someone (the journalist) has a certain perception (that the famous actress's life is extraordinary) but later realizes that it is not what it seems.

Explanation:
The target sentence compares two things, a neighbor's home and the speaker's own home, and suggests that while the neighbor's home may appear more attractive, it also requires more effort to maintain.

Option C makes a similar comparison between a drawing and a book. While a book may provide more detailed information, a drawing can convey a lot of information quickly and concisely.

The other options do not make a similar comparison between two things, so they are not analogous to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a change from unpleasant weather to pleasant weather after a storm. The analogous sentence would describe a similar change from something unpleasant to something pleasant.

Option A describes a change from strong winds to a soft breeze, which is analogous to the change described in the target sentence. The phrase ""following the stormy week"" in the target sentence is similar in meaning to ""after the gust of wind"" in option A, as both indicate a change after a period of unpleasant weather. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

B. Brian kept quiet at the board meeting, who knew he had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.
C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.
D. The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees.",C,"C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a person who, despite experiencing an emotional ordeal (crying the entire night), is able to put on a cheerful facade (greeting everyone like sunshine) in the morning.

Option C is the most analogous sentence as it describes a person who, despite physically exhausting themselves (running a marathon), collapses. Just as the person in the target sentence puts on a cheerful facade despite their emotional exhaustion, the person in option C collapses despite their physical exhaustion.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where people are asked to forget past conflicts and work together, which is not similar to the idea of putting on a cheerful facade despite emotional exhaustion.

Option B is also not analogous as it describes a situation where someone has a hidden advantage (an Ace up their sleeve), which is not related to the idea of emotional or physical exhaustion.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a company apologizing for not being able to pay a holiday bonus, which is not related to the idea of emotional or physical exhaustion."

D. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",D,"B. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where a gentle breeze follows a strong gust of wind that knocked down some shacks. The sentence emphasizes the contrast between the two wind conditions.

Option B describes a situation where a small amount of heat from a stove gradually melts a chocolate bar nearby. Like the target sentence, it emphasizes a contrast between two conditions, the gentle heat and the solid chocolate, which are juxtaposed to create an effect.

Option A does not convey a contrast between two conditions, and Option C does not describe a natural phenomenon like the target sentence. Option D does not describe a contrast between two conditions, but rather a cause-and-effect relationship between running a marathon and collapsing. Therefore, Option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.",D,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a situation where the company is facing financial difficulties due to poor management.

Both sentences convey a sense of making the best of a difficult situation."

D. A succession of waves battered the rock.",C,"C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes someone who becomes exhausted after engaging in a prolonged activity, and the sentence mentions ""several minutes"" to indicate a brief period of time.

Option C is the most analogous sentence, as it describes someone who becomes exhausted after running a marathon, which is a prolonged physical activity. The sentence also mentions a brief period of time (""he collapsed after he ran for the marathon""), which is similar to the target sentence's mention of ""several minutes"".

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence, as it describes a positive emotion (pride and joy) rather than exhaustion.

Option B is also not analogous, as it describes a political strategy rather than physical exhaustion.

Option D is not analogous, as it describes the action of waves battering a rock, rather than a person becoming exhausted after an activity."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where someone (Monica) did something (cooked food) to an excessive extent (so much that she had to take a leave) in a particular place (a restaurant).

Option C describes a situation where someone (Smith) did something (worked as a lawyer) to an excessive extent (for years) and then decided to stop (quit) and do something else (open a youtube channel for his singing videos).

Both sentences describe a situation where someone engaged in an activity to an excessive extent and then had to take a break or stop doing it. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence advises against quitting a job without a backup plan, emphasizing the importance of having a safety net before making a change. The most analogous sentence would be option C, which suggests bringing a map on a hike even if one is familiar with the area, as a precautionary measure in case of unexpected events. Both sentences highlight the value of being prepared for unforeseen circumstances."
33,"He left his partner to find true love, only to realize that he already had it before.","A. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.

D. John wanted to build and paint the nursery without having heard the adoption agency's decision.",C,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a preference for something old and familiar over something new and fancy.

36,Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.,"A. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.

D. You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.",D,"C. It was a fantastic vacation, but all good things come to an end.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea of accepting a less desirable situation because it is inevitable or unavoidable.

Rationale:
The target sentence advises the reader to continue watering their garden even if rain is forecasted. The analogous sentence (D) suggests bringing a map even if one is familiar with the area, as a precautionary measure. Both sentences convey the idea of taking a precautionary action despite feeling confident in one's abilities or circumstances."
38,"Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.","A. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

D. They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.",A,"C. Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a causal relationship between two events: using oven mitts to avoid burning hands and the cake being hot. The most analogous sentence would be one that also expresses a causal relationship between two events.

Option C establishes a causal relationship between Sally's emotions and Sharon's presence. It suggests that Sharon's presence causes Sally to feel happy and comfortable, much like how using oven mitts causes the avoidance of burned hands. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Option A expresses a contrast between the current weather and the speaker's mode of transportation, but it does not establish a causal relationship between two events.

Option B describes a situation where someone realizes a mistake and its consequences, but it does not establish a causal relationship between two events.

Option D describes a situation where someone's reputation is tarnished, but it does not establish a causal relationship between two events."

D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"A. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.

Explanation:

Similarly, option A expresses a situation where the speaker brings a map even though they are familiar with the area, as a precautionary measure in case they get lost. Both sentences convey the idea of taking extra precautions despite feeling confident in one's abilities."

D. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.",A,"The correct answer is B. Everyone thought that he would lose, but he made a comeback through herculean effort.

Option D is the most analogous sentence as it describes a situation where the speaker is willing to go all in and complete a task, despite the challenges they may face. The phrase ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" means that if they are going to do something, they might as well do it thoroughly and completely, rather than half-heartedly.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It states that Smith, who had been working as a lawyer for years, decided to take a step towards a new path by opening a youtube channel for his singing videos. This new path may seem unrelated to his previous career, but it is a first step towards a new journey.

Option A does not relate to the idea of a long journey beginning with a single step. It describes a moment where Rory's mother is happy because her son called after a long time.

Option B does not convey the idea of a journey beginning with a single step. It mentions a chef choosing a simpler recipe for a less adventurous customer, but it does not imply a long journey or a significant change.

Option D does not relate to the idea of a journey beginning with a single step. It states that someone with social anxiety joined a debate club many years ago, which led them to become a powerful and persuasive public speaker.

Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.

Explanation:
The target sentence states that people will only work hard when it is necessary for them. Option D is the most analogous sentence because it states that the speaker normally tries to maintain a good work-life balance, but in this particular case, they had to work non-stop because they had multiple deadlines that they couldn't miss. This shows that the speaker is willing to put in extra effort when it is necessary for them, which aligns with the idea expressed in the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a situation where the speaker had to work hard due to their partner's absence. Similarly, option C states that the speaker had to work non-stop for a week because they had multiple deadlines, indicating that they had to put in extra effort to meet their obligations. The other options do not convey a similar meaning, with option A providing a warning about using oven mitts when handling hot objects, option B emphasizing the importance of honesty in job applications, and option D describing a painter's unconventional choice of color. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a similar situation where a group had to work together to meet a deadline. Option D describes a situation where a group managed to finish a project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, which is similar to the target sentence.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Sally has to provide emotional support to her parents after the death of her sibling. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a situation where someone has to provide support or assistance to someone else in a time of need.

Option B describes a situation where David is at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic and has to scramble to set up a new system from scratch to avoid this outcome. This is similar to the target sentence in that David is providing support or assistance to his manager by working hard to set up the new system.

Option A does not describe a situation where someone is providing support or assistance to someone else in a time of need. Instead, it describes a situation where someone is drained and refuses to get up for several minutes.

Option C does not describe a situation where someone is providing support or assistance to someone else in a time of need. Instead, it describes a situation where a music producer is selecting a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client.

Rationale:
The target sentence describes a situation where someone (David) is at risk of receiving negative feedback (bad reviews) from their manager, and they take action (scrambling to set up a new system from scratch) to prevent this from happening.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It describes a situation where someone (the speaker) is at risk of having to do a lot of work (finishing the entire assignment on their own) due to their project partner getting sick. Like David, the speaker takes action (working day and night) to prevent this from happening.

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence. While it does mention preventing bigger troubles, it does not involve a specific situation where someone is at risk of receiving negative feedback and taking action to prevent it.

Option B is not analogous to the target sentence. It describes a situation where someone (the speaker) is angry, but then calms down, and does not involve a risk of negative feedback or taking action to prevent it.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence. It describes a situation where someone (Larry) is attached to working for a specific employer (Frank), but does not involve a risk of negative feedback or taking action to prevent it."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses that one should not engage in a particular activity (gossip and rumors) even though others are doing so.

Option D expresses a similar idea, that one's ideas or beliefs can be challenged by reading book after book, even though others may hold different views.

The other options do not convey a similar meaning to the target sentence. Option A suggests that there can be a positive aspect to a negative situation, but it does not address the idea of not engaging in a particular activity. Option B describes a person following someone else's example, but it does not relate to the idea of not engaging in a particular activity. Option C gives a piece of advice about keeping a jug of water nearby, but it does not relate to the idea of not engaging in a particular activity."

D. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.",B,"B. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that just because someone else is not doing something they are supposed to do, it doesn't mean that you should also not do it.

Option B conveys a similar idea, that just because your friend is not doing their homework, it doesn't mean that you can also skip doing your homework.

The other options do not convey a similar idea and are therefore not analogous to the target sentence."
91,Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.,"A. Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that just because someone else is doing something, it doesn't mean that you should do it too, especially if you have other responsibilities or work to do.

Option B conveys a similar idea. Sally's sister may have chosen to relax, but Sally herself had a lot of work to do, and following her sister's example was not the right choice for her.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (Larry) is not following instructions or requirements, whereas the target sentence is about not following someone else's example.

Option C is not analogous as it expresses a personal opinion about the color of a car, and the phrase ""beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder"" does not relate to the idea of following someone else's example.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (the speaker) is accepting something (a dress) that they may not have chosen themselves, but it is free and they are broke. This does not relate to the idea of following someone else's example."
92,Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.,"A. Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.

D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.",D,"D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that someone (Sally) followed the example of another person (her sister), but it turned out to be the wrong choice for her.

Option D conveys a similar idea. It states that just because someone else (your friend) is doing something (going to the spa), it doesn't mean that you can do the same thing (not do your homework). Both sentences convey the idea that one person's actions should not be used as a justification for another person's actions, especially when those actions are not appropriate or advisable for the second person.

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence. Although it mentions a negative consequence (getting into trouble) for not being truthful, it does not convey the idea of following someone else's example and suffering the consequences.

Option B is also not analogous. Although it mentions a negative consequence (bad reviews) for not meeting expectations, it does not convey the idea of following someone else's example.

Option C is not analogous either. Although it mentions a price increase, it does not convey the idea of following someone else's example or suffering negative consequences."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that Mary should not have done something (dropped out of school) because it goes against what is generally considered the right thing to do (staying in school). The analogous sentence would be one that expresses a similar idea, such as ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so,"" which suggests that the person being addressed should not engage in a particular behavior (using their pen for gossip and rumors) because it goes against what is generally considered appropriate or ethical, even if others are doing it."

Explanation:

Similarly, option C talks about the president, who is immensely popular, but he still has to step down at the end of his term due to the rules of the constitution. Both sentences convey the idea that even the best or most popular individuals have to follow certain rules or conventions and cannot stay in their position indefinitely."
96,"While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.","A. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",C,"C. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a sentiment that a particular time period (your 20s) should be enjoyed while it lasts. The most analogous sentence would be one that expresses a similar sentiment about a different time period or activity.

Option C is the most analogous sentence, as it expresses a sentiment that a particular experience (eating a delicious meal) should be enjoyed while it lasts. The phrase ""but before he knew it"" suggests that the experience was over quickly, much like the target sentence suggests that your 20s will be over quickly.

Option A does not express a sentiment about enjoying a particular time period or activity, but rather describes a narrow escape from a deadline.

Option B expresses a sentiment about pride and joy, but does not convey the idea of enjoying a particular time period or activity.

Option D does not express a sentiment about enjoying a particular time period or activity, but rather describes people with similar interests socializing together."

Option B, ""All that glitters is not gold,"" fits this description and is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

B. I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.
C. A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.
D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",D,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a sense of urgency or limited availability, as the delicious mangoes will not be accessible when the season changes. 

Option C conveys a similar sense of urgency, stating that the friend finally succeeded in passing 12th grade after five years of failure, implying that this success may not be available or guaranteed in the future. 

Option A describes a common occurrence in a particular area but does not convey a sense of urgency or limited availability. 

Option B expresses a personal grievance but does not relate to the theme of limited availability. 

Option D mentions the brief appearance of sunshine during the winter, but it does not convey the same sense of urgency or limited availability as the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence advises the listener to enjoy a particular period of their life (the honeymoon period of their marriage) before it ends.

Option B similarly advises the listener to enjoy a particular period of their life (their 20s) before it ends. Both sentences convey the idea of making the most of a limited time opportunity.

Option A is not analogous as it talks about trying something new (skydiving) despite fear, but does not convey the idea of a limited time opportunity.

Option C is not analogous as it talks about diversifying investments, and does not convey the idea of a limited time opportunity.

Option D is not analogous as it talks about someone's secrets being revealed, and does not convey the idea of a limited time opportunity."

D. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick I never would have need to finish the entire assignment on my own by working day and night.",A,"A. With no homework to do, I spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy my brother.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between having nothing to do and creating problems. The analogous sentence would be one that also expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between having nothing to do and doing something undesirable. Option A does just that by stating that with no homework to do, the speaker spent the weekend coming up with ways to annoy their brother. This is similar to the target sentence in that both describe a negative outcome resulting from having nothing else to do."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to, and they use their free time to think of ways to bother someone else. The most analogous sentence would be one that also describes a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to, and they use their free time to do something else.

Option B describes a situation where a doctor has no work or responsibilities to attend to during a break, and they use their free time to ask the staff not to interrupt them with minor tasks. This is similar to the target sentence in that both describe a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to and uses their free time to do something else.

Option A does not describe a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to, as the person in the sentence is obsessing over their previous girlfriend. Option C does not describe a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to, as the sentence is advising someone to apply to several companies. Option D does not describe a situation where someone has no work or responsibilities to attend to, as the sentence is comparing the appearance of two homes."

Explanation:
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option B. Both sentences describe a person who has a lot of free time and uses it to think about ways to cause trouble or create a disturbance. In the target sentence, Kate spends her days imagining schemes to get her boss fired because she has nothing else to do after getting fired herself. Similarly, Ron has a lot of free time and uses it to come up with detailed and complex pranks. The phrase ""because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything"" suggests that Ron has a lot of free time and nothing else to do, just like Kate."

D. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.",D,"The correct answer is A. David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager and scrambled to setup the new system from scratch.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine"" is saying that if something breaks or malfunctions, it's better to address the issue immediately rather than ignoring it, as it could lead to bigger problems later on.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It's saying that if David doesn't take action to fix the problem with the new system, he risks receiving negative reviews from his manager, which could lead to bigger problems in the future. Just like the target sentence, it emphasizes the importance of addressing a problem as soon as it arises to avoid more severe consequences later on.

Option B is not analogous to the target sentence. While it's true that losing weight can be difficult, the sentence doesn't convey the idea of addressing a problem before it becomes worse.

Option C is also not analogous to the target sentence. The sentence describes a situation where people who wear the same fashion and are around the same age tend to go to the same restaurant, but it doesn't convey the idea of addressing a problem before it becomes worse.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence. While it's true that it's a good idea to register for courses early to ensure a spot, the sentence doesn't convey the idea of addressing a problem before it becomes worse."

C. The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.
D. We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!.",D,"C

Explanation:
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option C: ""The students created a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.""

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in that it describes a situation where a lack of supervision or attention to detail can lead to problems or trouble. Just as neglecting small issues in a relationship can lead to bigger troubles down the road, neglecting the students' behavior in the class without a teacher can create a mess.

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence as it describes a situation where someone is prepared for a potential problem, whereas the target sentence describes a situation where a lack of attention to small issues can lead to bigger problems.

Option B is also not analogous as it describes a situation where someone has completed a task, whereas the target sentence describes a situation where neglecting small issues can lead to bigger problems.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where people want to take advantage of a sale, whereas the target sentence describes a situation where neglecting small issues can lead to bigger problems."

C. Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.
D. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.",C,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between two events. If the subject had taken a certain action (coming earlier), a different outcome (fixing the malfunction) would have resulted. However, since the subject did not take that action, a different outcome (needing to buy a new computer) is likely to occur.

Option C is the most analogous sentence as it also expresses a cause-and-effect relationship. If the visitors arrive between six and eight in the morning, it is better to come one hour before to avoid the crowd. This sentence also implies that if the visitors had come earlier, they would have been able to avoid the crowd.

Option A does not express a cause-and-effect relationship and is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option B is also not analogous to the target sentence as it compares two different methods of doing something, rather than expressing a cause-and-effect relationship.

Option D does not express a cause-and-effect relationship and is not analogous to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses regret that a problem was not addressed earlier, when it could have been solved more easily. The most analogous sentence is option D, which states that you can't pour from an empty cup. This implies that if you don't have something (in this case, a full cup) at the beginning, you won't be able to use it or benefit from it later on. Both sentences express the idea that a lack or deficiency at the start will lead to negative consequences later."

D. He wanted to buy a big house and a car, but his father advised him to get a job first.",B,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where something (the home's price) has changed over time, becoming unaffordable for some people (Will).

Option C describes a similar situation where something (Clark's proposal to Cece) took a long time to happen, but eventually did.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (Mike) is sharing an incident, but there is no mention of a change in circumstances over time.

Option B is not analogous as it describes a situation where a compromise is suggested to avoid a problem escalating, but there is no mention of a change in circumstances over time.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (the son) is advised to get a job before buying a big house and a car, but there is no mention of a change in circumstances over time."

Explanation:
The target sentence suggests that taking action early (going to the farmer's market) will result in a better outcome (securing the best batch). Similarly, option B suggests that taking action early (submitting course registrations) will result in a better outcome (getting a seat). Both sentences emphasize the importance of acting early to achieve a desired result."

C. You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.
D. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.",C,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence suggests that arriving one hour before the crowd (between 5 and 7 am) is a good idea to avoid the crowd.

Option C suggests that going to the doctor earlier (before it's too late) is a good idea to get cured.

Both sentences have the same logical flow, i.e., taking a certain action (arriving early or going to the doctor) at a specific time (one hour before/earlier) to avoid an unfavorable situation (crowd/illness).

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:

Option A does not describe a similar situation. It describes a person who started something new (their athletic career) and became successful at it, but does not mention any difficulty or struggle.

Option C does not describe a similar situation. It gives advice to keep watering a garden even if it might rain, but does not mention any struggle or difficulty.

Similarly, option B states that doing work thoroughly and responsibly (cause) helps avoid problems in the long run (effect). Both sentences have a similar structure and convey a similar message, making option B the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a situation where there was a lack of clarity due to trying to convey too much information in a short time.

Option C is the most analogous sentence as it also expresses a situation where there was a lack of clarity due to rushing. In this case, David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic and scrambled to set up the new system from scratch, resulting in a lack of clarity."

Explanation:
The target sentence emphasizes the importance of maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive effort at the beginning in order to achieve success in a marathon.

Option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It states that the father told the son that it was his way or the highway, indicating that the son needed to follow the father's instructions or face the consequences. Similarly, the target sentence advises runners to maintain a steady pace and avoid excessive effort at the start in order to avoid problems later in the race.

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence. While it mentions starting something (work), it does not convey the idea of maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive effort.

Option C is also not analogous to the target sentence. While it mentions politicians telling lies and facing problems as a result, it does not relate to the idea of maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive effort.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence. While it mentions a soft breeze blowing after a gust of wind, it does not convey the idea of maintaining a steady pace or avoiding excessive effort."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that someone is upset about a past event and is having trouble moving on, and another person is trying to encourage them to move on by saying that dwelling on it won't change anything.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It also expresses the idea that someone is upset about a past event (breaking up with Samantha) and is having trouble moving on, and another person (Mary, his sister) is trying to encourage them to move on by saying that dwelling on it won't change anything (there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on).

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence. It describes a person who greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine after crying the entire night, which has no relation to the idea of moving on from a past event.

Option B is also not analogous to the target sentence. It describes a person who prefers to learn from diagrams rather than notes, which has no relation to the idea of moving on from a past event.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence. It describes a person who is having trouble learning from a book due to peculiar grammar and word choice, which has no relation to the idea of moving on from a past event."

D. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.",B,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where a person (Larry) is still dwelling on a past event (breaking up with Samantha) even though it has been a long time. The sentence also mentions that the other person involved (Samantha) has moved on.

Option B describes a similar situation where a conflict (war) has ended, but the countries involved are still maintaining a connection (friendly relations) even though it has been a long time. Just as Samantha has moved on in the target sentence, the countries in option B have moved on from the conflict and are now maintaining friendly relations.

The other options do not describe similar situations and are therefore not analogous to the target sentence."

D. A succession of waves battered the rock.",A,"B. But if you look at the bright side you got to learn so much from the experience.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that getting angry or upset about a situation that cannot be changed is not productive, and instead, it's better to focus on the positive aspects of the experience.

Option B conveys a similar idea. It suggests that even though a difficult situation has occurred, there may be opportunities to learn and grow from it, rather than dwelling on the negative aspects.

Option A is not analogous as it deals with a personal relationship and moving on from it, rather than a situation that cannot be changed.

Option C is also not analogous as it deals with a superstition and seeking opinions, rather than a situation that cannot be changed.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a natural phenomenon and does not relate to emotions or personal experiences."

D. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.",A,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence suggests that we should put aside past disagreements or grievances and move forward in our relationship. The most analogous sentence would be one that also suggests putting aside something negative or troublesome and focusing on the present or future.

Option C, ""Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey,"" is the most analogous sentence. It suggests that we should not focus solely on the end goal and neglect to enjoy the process or journey towards achieving it. Similarly, the target sentence suggests that we should not dwell on past conflicts and instead focus on enjoying our current friendship.

Option A is not analogous as it suggests putting aside a negative feeling (disappointment in a sports team losing) in order to enjoy a positive experience (watching the World Cup together). Option B is also not analogous as it suggests putting aside work-related stress in order to enjoy a vacation, whereas the target sentence suggests putting aside past conflicts in order to enjoy a current friendship. Option D is not analogous as it suggests that an idle brain creates problems, whereas the target sentence suggests putting aside past conflicts in order to move forward in a relationship."

D. These files require a throrough look, don't skim through them quickly.",C,"C. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses that the speaker can see the joy or happiness on someone's face. Option C also expresses a similar idea, where Rory can see the happiness on her mother's face. The other options do not convey a similar meaning, and thus, are not analogous to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a positive emotion (happiness) on someone's face in response to a positive event (her brother calling after a long time). The most analogous sentence would be one that also expresses a positive emotion in response to a positive event. Option C does this by expressing the teacher's ecstasy in response to successfully explaining a complex topic to students."

D. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.",A,"A. I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown.

Explanation:
The target sentence implies that Brian has a hidden advantage or secret plan that he has not revealed yet. The most analogous sentence would be one that also implies a hidden advantage or secret plan, such as a fresh eyewitness that the defense lawyer has not revealed yet. Option A is the best choice.

Option B does not convey a sense of hidden advantage or secret plan, but rather a sense of disappointment or failure. Option C does not fit the context of the sentence and does not convey a sense of hidden advantage or secret plan. Option D does not convey a sense of hidden advantage or secret plan, but rather a sense of authority or control."

Explanation:
The target sentence implies that the speaker's team has not yet lost the contract, despite the opposing team's belief. They still have a chance to turn things around and win it back.

Option D is the most analogous sentence as it implies that Brian has a hidden advantage or plan that he has not yet revealed, much like the speaker's team in the target sentence. The phrase ""an Ace hidden up his sleeve"" is a common idiom that means to have a secret advantage or plan that can be used to gain an advantage when needed."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that someone cannot be dismissed because they have knowledge of something that could be harmful to their boss. Similarly, option C expresses the idea that you cannot write with an inkless pen, implying that it is impossible to write with a pen that has no ink. The other options do not convey a similar idea and are therefore not analogous to the target sentence."

D. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.",A,"A. I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the speaker's inability to forgive someone (Nick) for their past behavior (insulting the speaker at a party). The most analogous sentence would be one that also expresses a negative emotion (anger or resentment) towards someone (Kim) for their actions or lack thereof (choosing not to support the speaker at their wedding). Option A meets these criteria, making it the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.",C,"C. I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses that Sam stopped engaging with Peter in a friendly manner because Peter made fun of her insecurities. Similarly, option C states that the speaker holds it against someone for not treating them with respect. Both sentences convey a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction with someone's behavior towards them.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone's reputation is not accurate, and the person is not treated with respect.

Option B is also not analogous as it describes a situation where a father is setting boundaries for his son, and it does not relate to the theme of being treated disrespectfully.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where visitors arrive at a museum, and it does not relate to the theme of being treated disrespectfully."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Lester narrowly made the dance team by a small margin, as the audition was about to end.

Therefore, option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Just like the manager in the target sentence, Andy's boss is considering taking action against him (firing him) for his behavior.

Option A is not analogous to the target sentence as it describes a situation where someone (the speaker) has an advantage (stamina) that others are not aware of, whereas the target sentence describes a situation where someone (Silvy) is taking advantage of a system by passing on their responsibilities to others.

Option C is also not analogous to the target sentence as it describes a situation where someone (Sally) is aware of their situation with someone else (Scott) and has decided to be with them despite the circumstances, whereas the target sentence describes a situation where someone (Silvy) is taking advantage of a system without the knowledge or consent of others.

The sentence also includes a consequence or potential consequence (Garry planning to approach Hannah/professor penalizing Amy) for the avoidance behavior.

Option C conveys a similar idea. The speaker doesn't want to spoil the other person's mood, but they have a responsibility (babysitting their nephew) that they cannot avoid.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where the speaker's brother called after a long time, making the mother happy. It doesn't convey the idea of not wanting to spoil someone's happiness while still having to convey bad news.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where the speaker relaxed following their sister's example, but it wasn't the right choice because they had work to do. It doesn't convey the idea of not wanting to spoil someone's happiness while still having to convey bad news."

D. He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.",A,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence reveals unexpected news that contradicts the original belief. Option C is the most analogous because it also reveals a surprising turn of events. Smith's decision to quit his job as a lawyer and open a YouTube channel for his singing videos is unexpected and contradicts the original belief that he would continue to work as a lawyer."

Additionally, both sentences reference a broader context or standard that the person in question is not adhering to.

In option A, the sentence expresses a factual situation where a broken cup cannot contain coffee, but there is no element of regret or permission.

In option C, the sentence describes a situation where one person lied to gain entry to a school, while the other did not, and they had different experiences as a result. While this scenario involves deception and consequences, it is not directly analogous to the target sentence.

In option D, the sentence describes a person's humility and their achievement in securing a high rank in board exams. While it mentions achievement and humility, it is not related to the theme of regret and permission."

Option C is the most analogous sentence as it also expresses a situation where the speaker has to do something they don't want to do (present their work) and the reason for this is provided in the second part of the sentence (so they can go for the vacation).

Option A is not analogous as it does not express a situation where the speaker has to do something they don't want to do.

Option B is not analogous as it does not provide a reason for why John wanted to build and paint the nursery.

Option D is not analogous as it does not express a situation where the speaker has to do something they don't want to do."

D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.",B,"B. The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where the speaker knows that someone (Rick) is not a good friend and is only interested in personal gain, but the speaker chooses to maintain a relationship with that person for the time being.

Option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It describes a situation where the professor knows that the students have not done their homework properly (like Rick, who is not a good friend), but the professor chooses not to take strict action (like the speaker choosing to get along with Rick for the time being).

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (John) is wealthy, but lonely, and there is no mention of a relationship or interaction with someone who is not a good friend.

Option C is also not analogous as it describes a situation where someone prefers to stick with what they know (sweets) rather than trying something new, and there is no mention of a relationship or interaction with someone who is not a good friend.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone (the friend) is not doing their homework, but the speaker is not excused from doing their own homework. There is no mention of a relationship or interaction with someone who is not a good friend."
260,"The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.","A. She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"A. She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where the professor is aware of the students' wrongdoing but chooses not to take action. Similarly, option A describes a situation where the person knows the other person is lying, but chooses to ignore it. Both sentences convey the idea of being aware of a problem but choosing not to address it."
261,"Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.","A. She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.

C. He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.
D. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.",C,"C. He knows Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Lisa is aware of something (Mark borrowing her book without permission) but chooses not to mention it to him. Similarly, option C describes a situation where the speaker knows that Rick is not a good friend and is only after money, but chooses to get along with him for the time being. Both sentences describe a situation where the person is aware of something negative but chooses not to confront the issue."
262,"She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","A. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.
B. My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.
C. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
D. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.",A,"The correct answer is C. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a contrast between what someone says and what they actually do. The sentence ""I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing"" suggests that the speaker has a certain preference, but the phrase ""but beggars can't be choosers"" implies that they are unable to act on that preference due to their circumstances.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence, as it also expresses a contrast between what someone would like to do and what they are actually able to do. In this case, the speaker would like to have a house of their own, but they are unable to do so due to their financial situation.

The other options do not express a similar contrast and are therefore not as analogous to the target sentence. Option A is a sentence about someone's parents and their relationship with their children, and does not contain a contrast between what someone says and what they do. Option B is a sentence about a person's daughter and her behavior, and does not contain a contrast between preference and reality. Option D is a sentence about compromising with a neighbor, and does not contain a contrast between what someone says and what they do."
263,"He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.","A. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.
B. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.

265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","A. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.
B. Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.
C. The professor knows the students mostly copied the homework, but decides not to be strict about it.
D. You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.",A,"B. Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.

Explanation:
The target sentence and option B share a similar structure and meaning. Both sentences express the idea that a small problem or issue, if not addressed early, can lead to bigger problems or consequences later on. In the target sentence, the person's poor speaking about their guitar skills does not necessarily reflect their actual abilities, but their hard work and dedication are evident in the music they produce. Similarly, in option B, addressing small issues in relationships early on can prevent bigger troubles from arising in the future."
266,Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.,"A. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.
B. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.
C. I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.
D. All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,"C. I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Garry's words and actions are contradictory. Similarly, option C describes a situation where the speaker's determination to complete a task by Monday contradicts their actual work ethic, as they are working hard to achieve it.

Option A is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone's words and actions align, whereas in the target sentence, they don't.

Option B is not analogous as it describes a situation where a decision not to divorce leads to happiness, whereas in the target sentence, there is no mention of a decision or happiness.

Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where a song on an album ruins the vibe, whereas in the target sentence, there is no mention of music or vibe."
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.

D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"B. A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a contrast between what someone claims to be and what they actually are, highlighting their hypocrisy. Option B does the same, stating that a friend who had consistently failed finally succeeded, implying that their previous failures did not define their actual abilities."
268,A forest grew near the river.,"A. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
B. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.
C. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
D. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.",D,"C. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""A forest grew near the river"" is a simple statement describing the location of something (a forest) in relation to something else (a river). The most analogous sentence would be one that also describes the location of something in a simple way, such as ""It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event."" This sentence describes the location of the map (with directions) in relation to the instructions, and both sentences have a similar structure and tone."
269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"A. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.
D. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.",D,"C

Rationale:
The target sentence uses the metaphor of a guru as a source of knowledge and guidance for students. Similarly, option C uses the metaphor of a book as a source of knowledge and learning. In both cases, the focus is on the transfer of knowledge from a wise or authoritative figure to others. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
270,"John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.","A. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
B. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.

B. I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.
C. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.
D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",A,"C. Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Mary collected enough books to make her own library. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a situation where someone has enough of something to make or do something significant. Option C describes a situation where Mike has enough details to share an incident with someone, which is the most analogous to the target sentence."
272,Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.,"A. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
B. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.
C. He slipped at the edge of the cliff but managed to hold on to the rock and was saved just in time.
D. Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.",A,"
The correct answer is A. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Andy opens the window blinds, and as a result, the dark room becomes brightly lit. Similarly, in option A, John brings out one dish after another, and as a result, the guests begin gathering around. Both sentences describe a cause-and-effect relationship where an action leads to a consequence. In this case, the action of opening the window blinds leads to the room becoming bright, and the action of bringing out dishes leads to the guests gathering around. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"A. A forest grew near the river.
B. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.
C. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",A,"A. A forest grew near the river.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the development of a community outside the city center, which is a physical change in a particular location. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a similar physical change in a different location, such as a forest growing near a river.

Option A describes a similar physical change in a different location, and therefore, it is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Option B is not analogous to the target sentence as it describes an emotional change in a person rather than a physical change in a location.

Option C is also not analogous to the target sentence as it describes a change in the cleanliness of a floor rather than a physical change in a location.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence as it describes a change in the military strategy rather than a physical change in a location."
274,Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.,"A. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.
B. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.",D,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence uses a metaphor to describe the blades of grass as bayonets, creating a vivid and unexpected image. The most analogous sentence would be one that also uses a metaphor to create a similar effect.

Option C uses a metaphor to compare the chicken (which was not brought to the party) to a missed opportunity to taste the delicious pasta. This metaphorical comparison is similar in style and function to the one used in the target sentence, making it the most analogous option.

Option A uses a metaphor to compare a bicycle to a rusty old one, but it doesn't create a vivid and unexpected image like the target sentence.

Option B uses a metaphor to compare a job to a source of boredom and tiredness, but it doesn't have the same level of creativity and unexpectedness as the target sentence.

Option D doesn't use a metaphor at all, but rather a literal comparison between the corporation's actions and the problem they're trying to fix."
275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"A. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
B. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.
C. You can't write from an inkless pen.
D. Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.",B,"C. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a negative consequence of smoking cigarettes. Similarly, option C states that you cannot write with an inkless pen, implying a negative consequence of using a pen without ink. The other options do not convey a similar meaning or idea."
276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"A. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.
B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.
C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.",B,"B. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""He attacked every point in my argument"" means that someone criticized or refuted all the points in another person's argument. The most analogous sentence is ""He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer"" because it also expresses an action that affects something in a thorough or forceful way. Just as the person in the target sentence attacked every point in the argument, the person in option B knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer, leaving no room for error or imperfection."
277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.
C. She worked for weeks on the project and got so exhausted that she decided to go on a vacation for a month.
D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",A,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the effect of strong winds on cables supporting a cellphone tower, which are snapped as a result. The most analogous sentence would describe a similar effect of a natural force on a structure, which is what option A does. Option A describes the effect of waves on a rock, which is similar to the effect of wind on cables in the target sentence."
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.
B. Please don’t bother me today with any calls, I have bigger fish to fry.
C. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.
D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",C,"C. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.

Explanation:
The target sentence uses the metaphor of waves battering a rock to describe a forceful and persistent action. Option C uses a similar metaphor, comparing the corporation's efforts to fix a problem to waves battering a rock. The other options do not use this metaphor and are not analogous to the target sentence."
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"A. He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.
B. He attacked every point in my argument.
C. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.
D. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.",B,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a series of unfortunate events that affected the production of a play. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a series of events that affected something else.

Option C describes a series of events that led to someone receiving recognition and a promotion, which is similar in structure to the target sentence. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Option A describes a person's guitar skills, option B describes an argument, and option D describes a person's stress management. None of these options have a similar structure to the target sentence, and therefore, they are not the most analogous sentences."
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"A. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.
B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.",D,"B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the outcome of several risky fiscal policies. The most analogous sentence would describe the outcome of several months of hard campaigning, which is option B. "
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.
C. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.
D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.",A,"D. Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Explanation:
The target sentence uses the phrase ""threw in more and more"" to indicate that the corporation invested additional resources to solve a problem. Similarly, option D uses the phrase ""put in each and every ounce"" to convey that Harry dedicated all his energy and resources to his training. Both sentences convey the idea of investing more resources to achieve a goal. Therefore, option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
282,He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.,"A. Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.
B. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
C. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.
D. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.",B,"C. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes an action (knocking the nail) that has a direct effect (the nail is now in the wall). The most analogous sentence would be one that also describes an action (the weather becoming pleasant) that has a direct effect (the atmosphere is now pleasant).

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
283,Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.,"A. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.

B. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",D,"D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a general truth about the relationship between love and heart. The most analogous sentence would be one that expresses another general truth, and option D does that. Just as a broken heart can make it hard to love, no fuel can make it impossible to drive a car."
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.

C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"D. one can't eat from a broken plate.

Explanation:
The target sentence states that a broken cup can no longer contain its coffee. The most analogous sentence would be one that expresses a similar idea, that is, something that is broken or damaged cannot function as it should. Option D states that one can't eat from a broken plate, which conveys a similar idea and is therefore the most analogous sentence."
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"A. A succession of waves battered the rock.
B. Sally was adamant and stubborn about her religious beliefs and went through with the ceremony with full conviction.
C. Sally had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"D. one can't eat from a broken plate.

Explanation:
The target sentence uses the metaphor of a container (cup) to convey the idea that one cannot give or provide something if they themselves are empty or lacking. Similarly, option D uses the metaphor of a broken plate to convey the idea that one cannot eat or consume from something that is broken or damaged. Therefore, option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"A. The A team is the best one as it has the best players except Ron, who often negates the others' efforts.
B. one can't eat from a broken plate.
C. I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is! He is one of the greatest football players alive.
D. If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.",B,"B. one can't eat from a broken plate.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that something that is broken or damaged cannot function properly. The most analogous sentence to this is option B, which states that a broken plate cannot be used for eating. Just as a fallen tree cannot provide shade, a broken plate cannot be used for its intended purpose."
288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.
B. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.
C. After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.
D. Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.",A,"A. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.

Explanation:
The target sentence states that an unlit candle cannot provide light. Similarly, a broken cup cannot contain coffee, as it is no longer functional for its intended purpose. The other options do not convey a similar meaning or analogy."
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"A. He attacked every point in my argument.
B. It's hard to love with a broken heart.
C. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",B,"B. It's hard to love with a broken heart.

Explanation:
The target sentence uses a metaphor to convey the idea that something necessary for writing (ink) is missing from a pen, making it impossible to write. Similarly, option B uses a metaphor to convey the idea that something necessary for love (a whole heart) is missing, making it difficult to love. The other options do not use metaphors in the same way and are not analogous to the target sentence."
290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"A. The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.
B. You can't write from an inkless pen.
C. He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.
D. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.",B,"B. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that a car cannot run without fuel, just as a pen cannot write without ink. The other options do not convey this same idea of a necessary component being missing, so they are not analogous. Option A is comparing the efficiency of a drawing to a book, option C is describing a person's behavior after consuming sugar, and option D is describing a career change."
291,one can't eat from a broken plate.,"A. You can't write from an inkless pen.
B. I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.
C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
D. He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees.",A,"A. You can't write from an inkless pen.

Explanation:
The target sentence ""one can't eat from a broken plate"" is an analogy that compares a broken plate to a situation where something is not functional or usable. The most analogous sentence to this is option A, ""You can't write from an inkless pen,"" which also compares a broken or non-functional object (an inkless pen) to a situation where something cannot be done."
292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.
B. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.
D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.",A,"A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a process of something flowing from one container to another through a narrow passage. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a similar process of something changing or moving gradually, and that is option A.

In option A, ""little by little"" indicates a gradual process, and ""the stove’s radiating heat"" is the source of the change, just as the ""water"" is the source in the target sentence. The word ""melted"" also implies a gradual change, similar to the flow of water from one container to another.

Option B describes a sudden event (the flame extinguishing) followed by a lingering effect (the thin wisp of smoke), which is different from the gradual process described in the target sentence.

Option C is unrelated to the target sentence, as it describes a person's reputation and status, rather than a physical process.

Option D describes a sudden event (the revelation of a scandalous secret) and its effect on a person's political career, which is also unrelated to the gradual process described in the target sentence."
293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.

D. Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.",A,"A. The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes the movement of water from one body of water (Lake Erie) to another (Lake Ontario) through a connecting waterway (the Niagara River). Similarly, option A describes the movement of water from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe, which is a similar scenario of water flowing from one container to another through a smaller passage. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. In familiy planning, it's wise not to trust just one childcare method. Different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.",B,"B. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.

Rationale:

The other options do not share this theme of drainage or depletion of resources, and thus are not as analogous."

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",C,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a situation where someone in a position of authority sets a condition for someone else to follow, or else they will have to leave or face consequences.

Option C is the most analogous sentence as it also expresses a similar situation where the wife, who is in charge of the kitchen, sets a condition for the family to eat what she makes or go hungry. The phrase ""my way or the highway"" in the target sentence is similar to ""what I make or go hungry"" in option C, both indicating a choice between following the authority's rule or facing consequences."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a condition where an individual has to comply with a new rule or face the consequences. Similarly, option D states that the wife is in charge of the kitchen and the family will have to eat what she prepares or go hungry, indicating that the family members have no choice but to accept the wife's cooking or face the consequence of hunger. Therefore, option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. I told my wife I will compromise on most of the things but on holidays I can do whatever I want.",D,"C

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses the idea that the team must follow the technical lead's ideas without question or risk failure. The most analogous sentence would be one that conveys a similar idea of having to follow a particular approach or risk negative consequences.

Option C conveys a similar idea, stating that the presenters tried to convey a lot of information in a short time, but the presentation lacked clarity. This option does not directly relate to the context of the target sentence, but it does convey the idea that a particular approach (trying to convey a lot of information quickly) can lead to negative consequences (lack of clarity). Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."
302,I told my wife I will compromise on most of the things but on holidays I can do whatever I want.,"A. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",A,"B. Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a situation where the speaker has a desire or need that they expect to be fulfilled without compromise. Similarly, option B expresses a situation where Philip needs an entire day of focus to finish a project and has taken steps to ensure that by switching off all of his devices. The similarity in the expression of the expectation of fulfillment without compromise makes option B the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

C. A succession of waves battered the rock.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.",A,"C. A succession of waves battered the rock.

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the workers' inability to work a certain number of hours and their option to quit. Similarly, option C expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the waves and the rock, where the waves batter the rock. Neither option A, B, nor D expresses a similar cause-and-effect relationship, making option C the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

B. The soccer club is divided into groups of people from the same region who practice often with each other.
C. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.
D. Rory could see the happiness on her mother's face when her brother called after ages.",B,"C. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.

Explanation:
The target sentence uses the idiom ""birds of a feather flock together"" to describe how people with similar interests or characteristics tend to associate with each other. The most analogous sentence would be one that uses a different idiom to convey a similar idea.

Option C uses the idiom ""easier said than done"" to convey the idea that something is more difficult than it seems. The sentence structure and meaning are similar to the target sentence, as both use an idiom to describe a common phenomenon. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Option C describes a group of people (soccer club members) who share a common characteristic (being from the same region) and interact with each other (practice often with each other).

The other options do not describe a group of people with a common characteristic interacting with each other, so they are not analogous to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where people from the same region come together to practice soccer.

Both sentences highlight the idea of people gathering based on shared characteristics or interests, making option C the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence advises against relying solely on one option (selling shares when the market is low) and encourages considering alternative possibilities (waiting for a potential rebound). Similarly, option C cautions against putting all hope in a single venture and emphasizes the importance of having backup plans to mitigate potential failure. Both sentences convey the idea of diversifying or having alternatives to minimize risk."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses regret for not taking action during a specific time period when the outcome would have been more favorable. Similarly, option D expresses a desire to leave a job and open a restaurant, implying that the person has become bored or tired of their current job. Both sentences convey a sense of dissatisfaction with the current situation and a desire for change.

Option A is not analogous as it does not express regret or a desire for change. Instead, it cautions against making a hasty decision based on current circumstances.

Option B is also not analogous as it does not express regret or a desire for change. Instead, it describes a situation where one person has stopped talking to another due to a past event.

Option C is not analogous as it does not express regret or a desire for change. Instead, it highlights the effectiveness of a visual aid in deterring people from smoking."

Gary regrets not planning and starting during the spring and summer season when results are more visible.

Explanation:
The target sentence advises Samantha to wait for a better time to spend her savings on flight tickets, rather than spending it all during the holidays when prices are high. Similarly, option B advises Gary to wait for a better time to start his garden, rather than starting during the off-season when the results are not visible.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where a team won a game by breaking a tie and scoring a third goal. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a situation where a deal was finalized after a series of negotiations, which is option D.

In option A, the sentence describes a situation where the speaker had to finish an assignment alone due to their project partner getting sick. While it mentions a change in circumstances, it doesn't convey the same sense of resolution or finality as the target sentence.

Option B expresses a hypothetical situation where someone could have been cured if they had gone to the doctor earlier. While it mentions a change in circumstances, it doesn't convey the same sense of finality or resolution as the target sentence.

Option C describes a situation where the speaker is afraid of walking on the streets at night but will eventually do it once they start living alone. While it mentions a change in circumstances, it doesn't convey the same sense of finality or resolution as the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where the politician has almost certainly won the election after a long and difficult campaign. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a similar situation where a team has almost certainly won a game after a long and difficult match. Option A describes this situation, where the team has broken a tie and scored their third goal, making it highly likely that they will win the game.

Option B is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone appears to be one thing but is actually something else. Option C is also not analogous as it describes a situation where someone appears to be managing stress well, but the truth is different. Option D is not analogous as it describes a situation where someone collapses after running a marathon, which is not similar to the situation described in the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence states that Jim is the only one in the group who has engaged in criminal activity and has spent time in jail. The sentence highlights Jim's uniqueness in the group.

Option (D) is the most analogous sentence as it states that the A team is the best team except for Ron, who negates the others' efforts. This sentence highlights the uniqueness of the A team, except for Ron, who stands out in a negative way.

The other options do not convey a similar meaning to the target sentence. Option (A) talks about Larry's attachment to working for Frank, but it does not highlight any uniqueness. Option (B) mentions My sister's fear of sleeping in a dark room, but it does not convey any idea of uniqueness. Option (C) talks about the daily coffee expenses draining all income, but it does not highlight any uniqueness either."

Explanation:
The target sentence expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between not studying for a test and failing. Similarly, option B expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between not going to sleep early and waking up late. Both sentences use a similar structure to convey the idea that the consequence is a direct result of the action or lack thereof. Therefore, option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. He left his partner to find true love, only to realize that he already had it before.",B,"B. The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where someone engages in negative behavior (swindling) and ultimately experiences the negative consequences of that behavior themselves. The most analogous sentence would be one that describes a similar situation where someone's actions lead to negative consequences for themselves.

Option B describes a situation where someone (the boy) engages in deceptive behavior (crying wolf) and ultimately experiences negative consequences (the wolves really coming) as a result of their actions.

Explanation:
The target sentence describes someone facing consequences for their actions, which is also the case in option C. In both sentences, a significant amount of effort or time is spent on an activity that leads to a particular outcome. In option C, the effort of writing a novel is contrasted with the perception that writers do not do anything worthy, just as the target sentence contrasts the person's efforts to avoid paying taxes with the consequences they are now facing. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.",C,"C

Explanation:
The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option C. Mary started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done.

This option is similar to the target sentence in that it expresses a desire or expectation that is not yet fulfilled. In the target sentence, Larry wants to meet his favorite author but has not received an invitation yet. In option C, Mary wants to take a vacation but has not received permission yet. Both sentences express a sense of uncertainty or unfulfilled expectation.

The other options do not share this same sense of unfulfilled expectation and are therefore not as analogous to the target sentence. Option A describes a situation where someone is trying to sell something, while option B describes a personal transformation that occurred as a result of joining a club. Option D is a statement about the appropriateness of using a pen for gossip and rumors. None of these options express the same sense of desire or expectation that is not yet fulfilled as the target sentence and option C."

Both sentences show a desire to take action without having all the necessary information or approval."

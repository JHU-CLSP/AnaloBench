D. On his last birthday, Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight.",B,"B. Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a journalist who thought the life of a famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like. The most analogous sentence is B, which is about not judging people based on appearances alone, as appearances can be deceptive.

In the target sentence, the journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, but later realized that it was not what it looks like. This means that the journalist had a certain perception of the actress's life based on appearances, but later discovered that it was not accurate.

In sentence B, the speaker is warning against judging people based on appearances alone, as appearances can be deceptive. This is similar to the target sentence, as both sentences are about the dangers of relying on appearances to form judgments.

Sentence A is about a savvy politician who had a secret plan to win an election. This is not analogous to the target sentence, as it is about a political strategy, not a judgment based on appearances.

Sentence C is about a person who danced off a sugar high and then fell asleep. This is not analogous to the target sentence, as it is not about a judgment based on appearances.

Sentence D is about a person who drank too much on his last birthday and passed out before midnight. This is not analogous to the target sentence, as it is not about a judgment based on appearances.

In conclusion, sentence B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence, as it is about the dangers of relying on appearances to form judgments.

A. Claire always thought that Max was unkind and rude because of his edgy fashion sense. But once she learned how kind and sensitive he was, she was surprised.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a player who was worshipped by new recruits as the best player in the game, but when they met him, they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke. The most analogous sentence is A, which is about a person who was thought to be unkind and rude because of their edgy fashion sense, but when someone learned how kind and sensitive they were, they were surprised. Both sentences involve a person who was initially perceived in a certain way but was later revealed to be different.

B is not analogous because it is about using a map with directions versus reading instructions to arrive at an event.

C is not analogous because it is about a person who cannot sleep in a dark room due to their fears but wants to challenge themselves someday.

D is not analogous because it is about pouring from an empty cup.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is A.

D. Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.",B,"A. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who boasts about something that is not true. The options are about different situations where someone's perception of a person or thing is different from the reality. Option A is the most analogous because it is about a person who is afraid of skydiving but still wants to try it. This is similar to the target sentence because the person in the target sentence is boasting about something that is not true, and the person in option A is afraid of something but still wants to try it.

Option B is about a person who thinks another person is unkind and rude because of their fashion sense, but once they get to know them, they realize that they are kind and sensitive. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the person in the target sentence is boasting about something that is not true, and the person in option B is judging another person based on their fashion sense.

Option C is about a person who gets so many drinks on their birthday that they pass out before midnight. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the person in the target sentence is boasting about something that is not true, and the person in option C is getting drunk on their birthday.

Option D is about a person who is so attached to the idea of working for a specific person that no other employer can convince them otherwise. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the person in the target sentence is boasting about something that is not true, and the person in option D is attached to the idea of working for a specific person.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a person who dresses simply but is actually a millionaire. The options are about different situations where something is not what it seems. Option A is the most analogous because it is about the life of royals, which may look glamorous from afar but is not as happy and fun as it looks.

B. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.
C. He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.
D. A succession of waves battered the rock.",C,"
A. Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a person who has been painting for a long time and is now exhausted. The options are about different situations that could lead to exhaustion. Option A is the most analogous because it describes a person who is proud and joyful after their child graduates from middle school. This is similar to the target sentence because it describes a person who is exhausted after a long day of painting.

Option B is about a politician who has a secret plan that could make him win. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a person who is exhausted.

Option C is about a person who collapses after running a marathon. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it describes a person who is exhausted after running, not painting.

Option D is about a rock that is battered by waves. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a person who is exhausted.

Therefore, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:

Option A describes a person who avoided doing chores by pretending to be busy. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a person who did something excessive.

Option B describes a person who danced off his sugar high and then fell asleep. This is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a person who did something excessive (danced off his sugar high) and had to take a break (fell asleep).

Option C describes a person who quit his job as a lawyer to open a youtube channel for his singing videos. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a person who did something excessive.

Option D describes a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs as being more effective than just the statutory warning message. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a person who did something excessive.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option B.

32,"You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.","A. I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.
B. I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.
C. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.
D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.",C,"A. I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a statement that advises against quitting a job without having a better one lined up. The options are all statements that express a similar sentiment, but with different contexts. Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is also a statement that advises against doing something without having a backup plan. In this case, the person is advised against going out for dinner without having enough money to pay for it. The other options are not as analogous because they do not involve the same kind of advice or the same kind of backup plan.

D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.",B,"A. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who left his partner to find true love, only to realize that he already had it before. The most analogous sentence is one that also involves a person who is searching for something, only to realize that they already had it before.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it involves a person who is searching for something (in this case, a Grammy award), only to realize that they already had it before (in this case, they are already considered the god of rap).

Option B is not analogous because it involves a person who is preparing for a specific event (in this case, a rainy day), rather than searching for something.

Option C is not analogous because it involves a person who is expressing their opinion about something (in this case, a color combination), rather than searching for something.

Option D is not analogous because it involves a person who is engaged in a political strategy (in this case, a secret plan), rather than searching for something.

In conclusion, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option A: ""He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! People consider him to be the god of rap.""

Option A is the most analogous because it is about a person who is determined to complete a project, even if it means working late. Option B is about a person who is caring towards someone, but does not express their feelings. Option C is about a wife who is in charge of the kitchen and will not let the family go hungry.

Option C is about the speaker’s surprise at the outcome of an action, not about the speaker’s determination to complete a task.

Option D is about the speaker’s change in mood, not about the speaker’s determination to complete a task.

## 2. GMAT Sentence Correction: Sentence Completion

Sentence completion is a type of sentence correction question in which you are given a sentence with a blank and you have to choose the correct word or phrase to fill in the blank.

Here are some tips to help you solve sentence completion questions:

1. Read the sentence carefully and try to understand its meaning and context.
2. Consider the meaning of the blank and the context of the sentence.
3. Eliminate options that do not fit the context of the sentence.
4. Choose the option that best fits the context of the sentence and the meaning of the blank.

Here is an example of a sentence completion question:

The ______ of the new law was to protect the environment, but it has had the opposite effect.

A. intent
B. purpose
C. aim
D. goal

Answer:
A. intent

Explanation:
The sentence is about the purpose of the new law, which is to protect the environment. The word “intent” means the purpose or aim of something, so it is the best choice to fill in the blank.

Option B is also about the purpose of the new law, but it is not as specific as “intent.”

Option C is about the goal or aim of something, but it is not as specific as “intent.”

Option D is about the goal or aim of something, but it is not as specific as “intent.”

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

Option B is about a person's decision to travel and paint for enjoyment after graduation, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is about a person's decision to work hard while they are in a certain location, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is about a person's decision to see a project through and do anything to get the work done, which is not related to the target sentence.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who is determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.

The options are about a person who made the final cut to the university just by a small margin, a friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass, a person who never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her, and a person who prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

67,"While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.","A. Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.
B. In this part of town, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes.
C. There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.
D. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.",D,"
C. There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about the speaker's preference for sleeping on the sofa in the living room over a bed. The options are all about different situations where the speaker's preference is not the same as the majority.

Option A: The speaker believes that the color combination of orange and green is one of the best, despite the fact that many people dislike it.

Option B: The speaker is aware that many people try to pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes in this part of town, but they still believe it to be one of the best.

Option C: The speaker regrets their approach after the interview, but they move on to the next one.

Option D: The speaker asked Joe to lend them his bicycle, but they received an old, rusty one instead, which they had to use as they had no other option.

Option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also involves a preference that is not the same as the majority. The speaker regrets their approach after the interview, but they move on to the next one. This is similar to the target sentence because the speaker is fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now, despite the fact that a bed would be nice.

In summary, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it involves a preference that is not the same as the majority, and the speaker moves on to the next option.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a group of soldiers who lost half of their soldiers and had no other option but to use the tank to fight.

The most analogous sentence is the one that has a similar structure and meaning.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it also has a similar structure and meaning. It is about a vacation that was fantastic but had to end.

Option B is not analogous because it is about a TV show that ended, not about a vacation that ended.

C. After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.
D. As someone with social anxiety, joining the debate club many years ago led me to become a powerful and persuasive public speaker.",D,"D

Explanation:

The target sentence is a proverb that means that even a large task can be accomplished if you take small steps.

The options are all examples of how a person can start a new journey or path in their life.

Option A is about a mother who is happy to see her son after a long time. This is not a journey or a new path, but rather a reunion between a mother and her son.

Option B is about a chef who chooses a simple recipe for a customer who is not adventurous. This is not a journey or a new path, but rather a decision made by the chef to accommodate the customer's preferences.

Option C is about a lawyer who decides to quit his job and start a youtube channel. This is not a journey or a new path, but rather a change in career.

Option D is about a person with social anxiety who joins the debate club and becomes a powerful and persuasive public speaker. This is an example of how a person can start a new journey or path in their life by overcoming their fears and challenges.

Therefore, option D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

D. Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.",B,"A. While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person's athletic career starting with her first visit to the gym and her becoming a world-class athlete. The options are about different situations, but the most analogous sentence is Option A, which is about a person's escape from the secret police. The sentence describes how people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, but Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort. This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it describes a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome.

The other options are not as analogous because they do not describe a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome. Option B is a proverb that does not describe a specific situation, Option C is about bringing a map on a hike, which is not related to the target sentence, and Option D is about a person's sleep in a familiar place, which is not related to the target sentence.

In conclusion, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it describes a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome.
User 0: Thank you so much for the explanation! I'm still not sure why the other options are not analogous.

I understand that the target sentence is about a person's athletic career starting with her first visit to the gym and her becoming a world-class athlete.

Option B is a proverb that does not describe a specific situation.

Option C is about bringing a map on a hike, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is about a person's sleep in a familiar place, which is not related to the target sentence.

But I'm not sure why Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. Can you please explain it in more detail?
User 1: Sure, let's take a closer look at Option A:

>While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also describes a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome. In the target sentence, the person's athletic career started with her first visit to the gym, and she became a world-class athlete. In Option A, Peter managed to escape from the secret police, which was considered impossible by many people. Both sentences describe a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome.

Option B is a proverb that does not describe a specific situation, so it is not analogous to the target sentence. Option C is about bringing a map on a hike, which is not related to the target sentence. Option D is about a person's sleep in a familiar place, which is not related to the target sentence.

In conclusion, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it describes a person's journey from a difficult situation to a successful outcome, which is similar to the target sentence.

The sentence states that joining the debate club helped the person overcome their social anxiety and become a powerful and persuasive public speaker. This is similar to the target sentence because it describes a relationship between a challenge (social anxiety) and a result (becoming a powerful and persuasive public speaker).

C. Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.
This sentence is about the relationship between familiarity and preference.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about Sachin, who is the best cricketer in the world, but he had to retire like every other player.

Option D is about the winner of three Grammy awards being considered the god of rap, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

D. I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.",C,"
A. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a president who was popular but had to step down due to the rules of the constitution. The most analogous sentence is the one that has a similar structure and meaning.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it also has a similar structure and meaning. It is about a person who is obsessing over one thing while ignoring the bigger picture. This is similar to the target sentence because the president was popular but had to step down due to the rules of the constitution.

Option B is not analogous because it is about a person who is adamant and stubborn about their religious beliefs. This is not similar to the target sentence because the president was popular but had to step down due to the rules of the constitution.

Option C is not analogous because it is about a person who is on vacation and is told not to worry about work or stress. This is not similar to the target sentence because the president was popular but had to step down due to the rules of the constitution.

Option D is not analogous because it is about a person who is mad at a friend for not supporting them at their wedding. This is not similar to the target sentence because the president was popular but had to step down due to the rules of the constitution.

97,"I have had a great time in college, but tomorrow I will be graduating.","A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.
B. A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.
C. No need to take so much work this quarter, as performance won't impact appraisals. Work more in the next two quarters when the management will actively prioritize it.
D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.",A,"
A. Your 20s are the best time of your life, enjoy it while it lasts.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about the speaker's experience in college and their upcoming graduation. The sentence is written in the first person, using the pronoun ""I"" to refer to the speaker. The sentence also includes a past tense verb, ""have had,"" which indicates that the speaker has already experienced something in the past.

The options provided are all written in the third person, using the pronoun ""you"" to refer to the speaker. The options also include present tense verbs, indicating that the events described in the options are happening in the present or future.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also talks about the speaker's experience and their upcoming event. The sentence uses the pronoun ""your"" to refer to the speaker, and the verb ""enjoy"" is in the present tense, indicating that the speaker is currently enjoying their experience.

Option B is not analogous to the target sentence because it talks about a community that has developed over time, rather than a personal experience. The sentence also uses the pronoun ""a large suburban community,"" which is not analogous to the pronoun ""I"" used in the target sentence.

Option C is not analogous to the target sentence because it talks about work and appraisals, rather than personal experience. The sentence also uses the pronoun ""no need,"" which is not analogous to the pronoun ""I"" used in the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence because it talks about applying to companies, rather than personal experience. The sentence also uses the pronoun ""it would be better,"" which is not analogous to the pronoun ""I"" used in the target sentence.

In summary, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also talks about the speaker's experience and their upcoming event, using the pronoun ""your"" and the verb ""enjoy"" in the present tense.

C. After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.
D. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.",A,"
A. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a TV show that ended prematurely, and the writer wishes it had continued. The options are all about different situations where something ended prematurely, and the writer wishes it had continued.

Option A is the most analogous because it is about a person who is enjoying a meal, but before they know it, the meal is over. This is similar to the target sentence because the writer is wishing that the TV show had continued, but it ended prematurely.

Option B is about a person who is telling the truth to their mother, but they are worried about the consequences. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not worried about the consequences of the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

Option C is about a person who is angry, but then they calm down. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not angry about the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

Option D is about a person who is obsessing over their ex-girlfriend, but they are not sure why. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not obsessing over the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

Therefore, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

## Answer

A. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.

## Explanation

The target sentence is about a TV show that ended prematurely, and the writer wishes it had continued. The options are all about different situations where something ended prematurely, and the writer wishes it had continued.

Option B is about a person who is telling the truth to their mother, but they are worried about the consequences. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not worried about the consequences of the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

Option C is about a person who is angry, but then they calm down. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not angry about the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

Option D is about a person who is obsessing over their ex-girlfriend, but they are not sure why. This is not as analogous to the target sentence because the writer is not obsessing over the TV show ending, they are just wishing it had continued.

C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.",D,"C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who finished a meal without realizing it. The options are about different scenarios, but option C is the most analogous because it also involves a person finishing a meal without realizing it.

In option A, the community has developed over time, but there is no mention of a meal being finished.

In option B, the picture of diseased lungs is more effective than the warning message, but there is no mention of a meal being finished.

In option D, the TV show ended, but there is no mention of a meal being finished.

Option C is the only option that involves a person finishing a meal without realizing it, making it the most analogous to the target sentence.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Note: This is just one example of a question that could be asked on the GMAT. The GMAT is a standardized test, so the questions will be similar in format and difficulty to those in this example. However, the specific content of the questions will vary.

## GMAT Question of the Day

If x is an integer, is x even?

(1) x^2 is even.
(2) x^3 is even.

A. Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.
B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
C. BOTH statements TOGETHER are sufficient, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.
D. EACH statement ALONE is sufficient.
E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.

Correct Answer - A - Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

## GMAT Question of the Day Solution

The question asks if x is even.

Statement (1): x^2 is even.

This means that x^2 is divisible by 2. This means that x is divisible by 2, and therefore x is even.

Statement (1) is sufficient.

Statement (2): x^3 is even.

This means that x^3 is divisible by 2. This means that x^3 is divisible by 4. This means that x is divisible by 4.

This does not necessarily mean that x is divisible by 2, and therefore x is not necessarily even.

Statement (2) is not sufficient.

The correct answer is A."

B. Since both of our favourite teams have lost, lets enjoy the world cup together and not fight.
C. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal.
D. But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.",D,"
B. Since both of our favourite teams have lost, lets enjoy the world cup together and not fight.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about being thankful for the sunshine in the summer because it only appears briefly during the winter. The most analogous sentence is the one that expresses a similar sentiment about something else that is only available for a limited time.

The sentence “Since both of our favourite teams have lost, lets enjoy the world cup together and not fight.” is the most analogous sentence because it expresses a similar sentiment about something else that is only available for a limited time. In this case, the World Cup is only available for a limited time, and the speaker is suggesting that they enjoy it together and not fight.

The other options are not as analogous because they do not express a similar sentiment about something else that is only available for a limited time.

Option A: “You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap. Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound.” This sentence is about investing in the stock market, which is not something that is only available for a limited time.

Option C: “The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal.” This sentence is about a sports game, which is not something that is only available for a limited time.

Option D: “But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal.” This sentence is about eating a meal, which is not something that is only available for a limited time.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about the students creating a mess in the class when there was no teacher to monitor.

The sentence is about the students misbehaving in the absence of the teacher.

The options are about different situations where people are not given responsibilities, or are not responsible for their actions.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a person who comes up with complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.

This is similar to the target sentence because it is about people not being responsible for their actions, and the consequences of their actions.

Option B is about a person who knows that his friend is not a good friend, but chooses to get along with him for the time being.

This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is about a personal relationship, and not about people not being responsible for their actions.

Option C is about a person who should not be using his pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.

This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person using his pen for gossip and rumors, which is not the same as people not being responsible for their actions.

Option D is about a person who should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.

This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person spending all her savings on the flight tickets, which is not the same as people not being responsible for their actions.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about resolving small issues in relationships immediately to prevent bigger troubles down the road.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is also about resolving a small issue (not needing a map) immediately (before going on a hike) to prevent a bigger issue (getting lost during the hike).

Option B is about a director completing a film after doing everything in his power to get the film released and bankrupting his production company. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about resolving a small issue immediately to prevent a bigger issue.

Option C is about students creating a mess in a class when there was no teacher to monitor. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about resolving a small issue immediately to prevent a bigger issue.

Option D is about going early to a boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about resolving a small issue immediately to prevent a bigger issue.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option A.

D. Once she got bored and tired with the same old job, she decided to leave and opened up a restaurant.",C,"A. She cannot be dismissed because she is aware of the boss's shady business dealings.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a computer malfunction and the possibility of fixing it. The options are about different situations, but they all have a similar structure. Option A is the most analogous because it also has a cause and effect relationship. The cause is the boss's shady business dealings, and the effect is that the employee cannot be dismissed.

Option B is about using a map with directions instead of reading instructions, but it doesn't have a cause and effect relationship. Option C is about museum visitors arriving at different times, but it doesn't have a cause and effect relationship either. Option D is about a person leaving their job to open a restaurant, but it doesn't have a cause and effect relationship either.

B. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about a problem that was not addressed at the right time, and now it's too late to rectify it. The options are:

A. It is not that cold today, but I'd still go by car since I can't afford to get sick.

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a problem that was not addressed at the right time.

B. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.

This option is analogous to the target sentence because it involves a problem that was not addressed at the right time (going to the farmer's market early to secure the best batch) and now it's too late to rectify it (the remaining options may not be as favorable).

C. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a problem that was not addressed at the right time.

D. Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a problem that was not addressed at the right time.

128,"Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.","A. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.
B. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.
C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. After working two years for the company she was burned out.",A,"A. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.

Explanation:
The target sentence is ""Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.""

The sentence has two parts:

Part 1: ""Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics.""

This part is similar to the sentence ""The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's."" Both sentences are describing a situation where something is not understood or appreciated by many people.

Part 2: ""But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.""

This part is similar to the sentence ""But she really enjoys using it."" Both sentences are describing a situation where someone has a different perspective or opinion from the majority.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.""

Option A is the correct answer.

Option B is incorrect because it does not have a similar structure to the target sentence. The sentence ""Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble."" is describing a situation where someone is liked by everyone because of their quiet and obedient nature, while their cousin is not liked because of their wild behavior.

Option C is incorrect because it does not have a similar structure to the target sentence. The sentence ""After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year."" is describing a situation where someone is advised to change their behavior after experiencing disappointment.

Option D is incorrect because it does not have a similar structure to the target sentence. The sentence ""After working two years for the company she was burned out."" is describing a situation where someone is burned out after working for a company for two years.

In conclusion, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.""

D. Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon.",C,"B. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who is not the speaker's favorite singer but is loved by his brother. The options are about different situations, but option B is the most analogous to the target sentence. It is about a person who finally gets the job after a successful interview. This option is the most analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person who is not the speaker's favorite but is loved by someone else.

The other options are not as analogous to the target sentence. Option A is about a person who is familiar with a part of the woods but brings a map with them in case they get lost. This option is not as analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person who is familiar with a part of the woods, not a singer. Option C is about a person who believes that the color combination of orange and green is one of the best. This option is not as analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person's opinion on a color combination, not a singer. Option D is about a person who maintains a steady pace and avoids excessive running at the start of a marathon. This option is not as analogous to the target sentence because it is about a person's running strategy, not a singer.

In conclusion, option B is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a person who is not the speaker's favorite but is loved by someone else.

D. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.",C,"C. Although she realized the mistake a week after the incident, she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about the speaker taking three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least he has the credential now. The sentence is about a speaker who took longer than expected to finish a training program, but he has the credential now.

Option A is about the economic depression being the combined result of several risky fiscal policies. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the target sentence is about a speaker who took longer than expected to finish a training program, while option A is about the economic depression being the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.

Option B is about Lake Erie draining into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the target sentence is about a speaker who took longer than expected to finish a training program, while option B is about Lake Erie draining into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.

Option C is about a speaker who realized the mistake a week after the incident, but she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing. This is analogous to the target sentence because the target sentence is about a speaker who took longer than expected to finish a training program, while option C is about a speaker who realized the mistake a week after the incident, but she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.

Option D is about a speaker who does not know that the other person is the president of the United States. This is not analogous to the target sentence because the target sentence is about a speaker who took longer than expected to finish a training program, while option D is about a speaker who does not know that the other person is the president of the United States.

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a man named Clark who took 10 years to propose to a woman named Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through. The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option B, which is about a woman who realized her mistake a week after the incident but waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.

In both the target sentence and Option B, the main characters took a long time to do something (Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece and the woman waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing). The target sentence and Option B also have a similar structure, with the main character doing something after a long time and then finally coming through.

Option A is about missing the bus and walking instead, which is not analogous to the target sentence. Option C is about enjoying the honeymoon period of a marriage, which is also not analogous to the target sentence. Option D is about a man who built an immense fortune by swindling others but lost it all when someone swindled him, which is also not analogous to the target sentence.

He realized that he should have had other backup plans.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about the importance of telling the truth and how it can relieve stress. The options are all about different situations where someone is in a difficult or stressful situation and how they deal with it.

Option A is about a person who kept quiet at a board meeting, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

Option B is about a person who made the dance team by the skin of his teeth, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

Option C is about a person who was depending heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was ruined. He realized that he should have had other backup plans. This is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a person who is in a difficult or stressful situation and how they deal with it. The person in the target sentence is in a difficult situation because they are lying to their mother, and the person in option C is in a difficult situation because their venture failed. Both situations involve stress, and both people realize that they should have had other backup plans.

Option D is about two people who lied to get into the school, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

## Answer

## Explanation

The target sentence is about the importance of telling the truth and how it can relieve stress. The options are all about different situations where someone is in a difficult or stressful situation and how they deal with it.

Option A is about a person who kept quiet at a board meeting, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

Option B is about a person who made the dance team by the skin of his teeth, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

Option C is about a person who was depending heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was ruined. He realized that he should have had other backup plans. This is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a person who is in a difficult or stressful situation and how they deal with it. The person in the target sentence is in a difficult situation because they are lying to their mother, and the person in option C is in a difficult situation because their venture failed. Both situations involve stress, and both people realize that they should have had other backup plans.

Option D is about two people who lied to get into the school, but it does not mention anything about telling the truth or relieving stress.

148,"Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.","A. When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.
B. Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.
C. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.
D. The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.",B,"
A. When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about the importance of taking one's time and not rushing through an assignment. The sentence emphasizes that taking one's time is important and that rushing through an assignment can lead to mistakes and a waste of time.

The options are:

Option A: ""When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.""

This option is the most analogous to the target sentence because it also emphasizes the importance of taking one's time and not rushing through something. In this case, the ""something"" is the opportunity to enjoy delicious mangoes before the season changes. The option uses the phrase ""so, devour them"" to emphasize the importance of taking advantage of the opportunity before it is gone.

Option B: ""Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.""

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about the importance of taking one's time and not rushing through something. Instead, it is about the consequences of not taking the time to do something properly.

Option C: ""It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.""

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about the importance of taking one's time and not rushing through something. Instead, it is about the benefits of taking multiple actions rather than just one.

Option D: ""The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.""

This option is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about the importance of taking one's time and not rushing through something. Instead, it is about the consequences of making a bad decision.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous to the target sentence.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who doesn't read the requirements before starting a work and tries to finish it early. This leads to others having to fix his work.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It is about a person who wants to teach a class of even 10 students. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.

Option B is about files that need a thorough look and not a quick skim through.

Option C is about a roommate who never cleans up after himself and another roommate who doesn't clean up because of that.

Option D is about a person who wants to book honeymoon tickets before she has even been proposed to.

B. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.
C. David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager and scrambled to setup the new system from scratch.
D. Kim checked the papers in a rush so that she can have more free time. But, now she needs to redo them as half of the class complained.",D,"A. I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a presentation that was a mess because the presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is also about a situation where a lot of information was conveyed in a short time, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. In the target sentence, the presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity, and in Option A, the TV show ended abruptly, leaving viewers wanting more.

Option B is about a situation where a person is clueless about their situation with someone else, but they have decided to be with them despite the circumstances. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a situation where a lot of information was conveyed in a short time, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.

Option C is about a situation where a person was at risk of receiving bad reviews for their work ethic from their manager, so they scrambled to set up a new system from scratch. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a situation where a lot of information was conveyed in a short time, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.

Option D is about a situation where a person checked their papers in a rush so that they could have more free time, but now they need to redo them because half of the class complained. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not involve a situation where a lot of information was conveyed in a short time, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.

In conclusion, Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is also about a situation where a lot of information was conveyed in a short time, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction.

D. A soft breeze blew after the gust of wind shook down the shacks.",A,"A. Larry always starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running in a marathon. The most analogous sentence is the one that also involves maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it also involves maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running. Larry starts the work without reading the requirements and tries to finish it early as well. This leads to others having to fix his work.

Option B is not analogous because it is about a father telling his son that it is his way or the highway when the son comes home drunk.

Option C is not analogous because it is about politicians telling lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.

Option D is not analogous because it is about a soft breeze blowing after a gust of wind shook down the shacks.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option A.

A. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about regretting your approach after an interview. The most analogous sentence is one that talks about starting a journey or taking a step towards something. The sentence ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"" fits this description well. It is a proverb that means that even big tasks can be accomplished if you take the first step. This is similar to the target sentence because it is about taking a step towards something, even if it is difficult.

B. Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through.

This sentence is about a couple who were in a relationship for 10 years before the man proposed. It is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about regretting your approach after an interview.

C. Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.

This sentence is about losing weight and the challenges that come with it. It is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about regretting your approach after an interview.

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.

This sentence is about making amends after a disagreement. It is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about regretting your approach after an interview.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about Larry, who is upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option A. The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.

In this sentence, the congressman is like Larry, who is upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The bill is like Samantha, who has moved on. The congressman’s sister is like Mary, who finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a fallen tree and a painting of it. The option that is most analogous to the target sentence is option B, which is about a decision not to go through a divorce and the parents living happily ever since. Both the target sentence and option B involve a decision that has a positive outcome.

Option A is about a fallen tree and shade, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is about a book and learning, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is about two people and lying, which is not related to the target sentence.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a mother's happiness when her son calls after a long time. The options are about different situations where people are happy or excited about something.

Option A: It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.
This option is about a person who is applying for a job and is advised to apply to multiple companies instead of just one. This is not related to the target sentence.

Option B: Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
This option is about a person who is smoking cigarettes and is warned that every cigarette they smoke is a threat to their health. This is not related to the target sentence.

Option C: The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.
This option is about a teacher who is happy and excited that they have finally succeeded in explaining a complex topic to their students. This is similar to the target sentence where the mother is happy and excited that her son has called after a long time.

Option D: Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.
This option is about a person who is obsessing over their previous girlfriend because they have nothing else to do during a break. This is not related to the target sentence.

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

169,Samantha was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.,"A. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
B. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.
C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.
D. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.",A,"A. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.

Explanation:
The target sentence is a statement that expresses Samantha's happiness at the realization that David had kept her trust by not going to the event. The sentence is written in the past tense and uses the word ""realised"" to indicate the moment of realization. The sentence also includes the phrase ""by not going to the event"", which indicates that David's actions were intentional and that he had made a conscious decision not to attend the event.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. It also expresses a moment of realization, in this case, the incharge's realization that the floor had been cleaned properly. The sentence is written in the past tense and uses the word ""realised"" to indicate the moment of realization. The sentence also includes the phrase ""by the new hire"", which indicates that the cleaning was done by a new employee.

Option B is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not express a moment of realization. Instead, it expresses a feeling of anticipation and a lack of invitation. The sentence is written in the present tense and uses the word ""looked"" to indicate the feeling of anticipation. The sentence also includes the phrase ""at the event"", which indicates that the author is expected to attend the event.

Option C is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not express a moment of realization. Instead, it expresses a natural event that caused damage. The sentence is written in the past tense and uses the word ""snapped"" to indicate the damage caused by the strong winds. The sentence also includes the phrase ""the cables supporting the cellphone tower"", which indicates that the damage was caused by the cables being snapped.

Option D is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not express a moment of realization. Instead, it expresses a feeling of surprise and a lack of knowledge. The sentence is written in the present tense and uses the word ""know"" to indicate the feeling of surprise. The sentence also includes the phrase ""he is the president of the United States"", which indicates that the person being addressed is not aware of the president's identity.

In conclusion, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it expresses a moment of realization, is written in the past tense, and includes the phrase ""by the new hire"". Option B, C, and D are not analogous to the target sentence because they do not express a moment of realization, are written in different tenses, and include different phrases.

D. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.",A,"
A. Brian kept quiet at the board meeting, who knew he had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a defense lawyer who has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown.

The most analogous sentence is the one that has a similar structure and meaning.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it also has a similar structure and meaning.

The sentence is about a person who kept quiet at a board meeting, but it was later revealed that he had an ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.

This is similar to the target sentence because it is about a person who was previously unknown, but later revealed to have a fresh eyewitness.

Option B is not the most analogous sentence because it is about a person who was reassured after consulting with a professor, but it is not about a person who was previously unknown.

Option C is not the most analogous sentence because it is about a painter who had to paint with red because he did not have the yellow color with him, but it is not about a person who was previously unknown.

Option D is not the most analogous sentence because it is about a person who lost everything in a fire, but it is not about a person who was previously unknown.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence is Option A.

This is similar to the sentence in option B, which describes a situation where water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe. In both cases, there is a potential for something to change the outcome of the situation.

Option A describes a teacher who is happy that he has finally succeeded in explaining a complex topic to his students. This is not analogous to the target sentence because there is no potential for anything to change the outcome of the situation.

Option C describes a person who danced off his sugar high and then fell asleep. This is not analogous to the target sentence because there is no potential for anything to change the outcome of the situation.

The sentence ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there. Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this."" is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

In both sentences, the subject cannot be dismissed or fired because they know something that the other party does not want them to know.

In the target sentence, the subject is ""She"" and the reason she cannot be dismissed is because she is aware of the boss's shady business dealings.

In the analogous sentence, the subject is ""You"" and the reason you cannot be fired is because you know about a problem that needs to be discussed.

B. Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.

Explanation:

The target sentence is “I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.”

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is “Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.”

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a person who made it into the dance team by the skin of his teeth. The most analogous sentence is the one that has a similar structure and meaning.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it also has a similar structure and meaning. In this sentence, the person is dressed in simple clothes without logos, but they are actually a millionaire.

Option B is not analogous because it is about a string of unfortunate events that plagued the production of a play. This is not similar to the target sentence because it is about a different topic and has a different structure.

Option C is not analogous because it is about a water experiment with a beaker and a pipe. This is not similar to the target sentence because it is about a different topic and has a different structure.

Option D is not analogous because it is about a person who escaped from the secret police. This is not similar to the target sentence because it is about a different topic and has a different structure.

185,"While people believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter somehow managed to do so successfully, albeit a bit close for comfort.","A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
B. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.
C. In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished.
D. To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.",A,"
A. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a person who managed to escape from the secret police, which is a difficult and dangerous task. The sentence also mentions that the person managed to do so successfully, but it was a close call.

The most analogous sentence is ""The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline."" This sentence also describes a successful outcome that was achieved with difficulty and a close call. In both sentences, the main character or group of characters overcame a challenge or obstacle to achieve their goal.

Option B is not analogous because it describes a situation where the wife is in charge of the kitchen and the family will eat what she makes or go hungry. This sentence does not involve a difficult or dangerous task, and the outcome is not as significant as in the target sentence.

Option C is not analogous because it describes a situation where the speaker is making a decision to stay up all night to finish a project. This sentence does not involve a difficult or dangerous task, and the outcome is not as significant as in the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it describes a situation where the speaker is going to the farmer's market to get the best batch of produce. This sentence does not involve a difficult or dangerous task, and the outcome is not as significant as in the target sentence.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is ""The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.""

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a group of people who managed to finish a project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline. The options are about different situations where people managed to achieve something just in time. Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a person who managed to hold on to a rock and was saved just in time after slipping at the edge of a cliff. Option B is about a person who managed to pass an exam after failing it for five years, but it is not about a group of people working on a project. Option C is about a team of people who managed to win a title after firing their manager, but it is not about a group of people working on a project. Option D is about a person who collapsed after running a marathon, but it is not about a group of people working on a project.

"
189,Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.,"A. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.
B. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.
C. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.
D. He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.",C,"A. That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about a game where both teams were close to victory, but one team won. The most analogous sentence would be about a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked, but it was free and they were broke.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it describes a situation where the person chose the option that was not exactly what they would have picked, but it was free and they were broke.

Option B is not the most analogous sentence because it describes a situation where the person asked someone to lend them something, and they received an old, rusty item that they had to use because they had no other option. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked.

Option C is not the most analogous sentence because it describes a situation where a group managed to finish a project just in time and submitted a report before the deadline. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked.

Option D is not the most analogous sentence because it describes a situation where someone spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now they are facing a long prison sentence. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it does not describe a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked.

In summary, option A is the most analogous sentence because it describes a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked, but it was free and they were broke. Option B, C, and D are not the most analogous sentences because they do not describe a situation where one person had a choice between two options, but chose the one that was not exactly what they would have picked.

A. To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about losing weight, which is a difficult task. The options are about different situations that require commitment or dedication. Option A is the most analogous because it is about teaching a class, which requires a lot of preparation and dedication. Option B is about a presentation that was a mess, which does not require commitment or dedication. Option C is about not wanting to be bothered, which does not require commitment or dedication. Option D is about watering a garden, which does not require commitment or dedication.

C. No light can be found from an unlit candle.
D. The opponents are unaware of my greatest asset, which is my stamina. The other runners have no chance at all!.",A,"
A. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about driving a car in heavy traffic, which is difficult and requires skill. The most analogous sentence is the one that is also about something that is difficult and requires skill.

Option A is the most analogous sentence because it is also about something that is difficult and requires skill. The sentence is about passing an entrance exam, which is difficult and requires focus and discipline.

Option B is not analogous because it is about a project partner getting sick and the speaker having to finish the assignment on their own. This is not about something that is difficult and requires skill.

Option C is not analogous because it is about a candle being unlit and not about something that is difficult and requires skill.

Option D is not analogous because it is about the speaker's stamina being their greatest asset in a race. This is not about something that is difficult and requires skill.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence is Option A.

D. It takes a lot of effort to write a novel, so do not think writers do nothing worthy.",C,"C. Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.

Explanation:
The target sentence is about how people should not think that writers do nothing worthy because it takes a lot of effort to write a novel. The most analogous sentence is the one that also talks about how people should not underestimate a particular job or activity because it takes a lot of effort and skill to do it well. Option C is the best choice because it talks about how Victor thought acting was an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realized that acting is an art form not everyone can master, and that it takes a lot of effort and skill to do it well. Option D is the target sentence and is not an option.

## Answer

C. Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.

The target sentence is about Sally, who has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.

Option B is about drinkers who get together in a bar, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

User 1: I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm curious about the ""only generate a letter from [A, B, C, D] without any additional text"" part.

I'm not sure what that means.
User 0: The only thing that is required is to generate a letter from the options.

You can't write anything else.

For example, if the options are A, B, C, D, you can't write ""A is the correct answer"" or ""The correct answer is A"".

You can only write ""A"" or ""B"" or ""C"" or ""D"".

D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",C,"
A. Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a man who decided to quit his job and live his life in the fast lane. The options are about different situations where people make decisions or take actions.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it is about a chocolate bar that is slowly melting. This is similar to the target sentence because it is about a man who is making a decision to quit his job and live his life in the fast lane.

Option B is about a woman who thinks her neighbor's home is more attractive than her own, but she has no idea that it is more difficult to keep up. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about a man who is making a decision to quit his job and live his life in the fast lane.

Option C is about a woman who gets bored and tired with the same old job, so she decides to leave and open up a restaurant. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about a man who is making a decision to quit his job and live his life in the fast lane.

Option D is about a woman who collects so many books over the years that she eventually has enough to make her own library. This is not analogous to the target sentence because it is not about a man who is making a decision to quit his job and live his life in the fast lane.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is Option A.

Explanation:

The target sentence is about a person who got bored and tired with her job and decided to leave and open up a restaurant.

The options are:

A. The baby looks as snug as a bug in a rug next to her mother.

B. When he finally started earning after years of struggle, Alex spent all his money on drinks and parties as he wanted to enjoy his life now.

C. The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.

D. Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.

Option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence. Both sentences describe a situation where someone is in a comfortable and cozy environment. In the target sentence, the person is comfortable and relaxed in her new job as a restaurant owner, while in option A, the baby is comfortable and relaxed next to her mother.

Option B is not analogous because it describes a situation where someone is spending money on drinks and parties, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is not analogous because it describes a situation where strong winds are causing damage to a cellphone tower, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it describes a situation where someone is focused on a project and has switched off his devices, which is not related to the target sentence.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

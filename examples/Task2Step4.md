Story1: In the heart of the countryside, just shy of a gurgling blue river, a vast and breathtaking forest came into existence. These trees reached so high into the sky, as if attempting to scratch the belly of the clouds above. Untamed foliage packed the woods, teeming with unknown secrets and countless species both wild and free. The calming song of the river was interrupted occasionally by a forest bird's tweet or a squirrel's jittery leap from branch to branch. Dawn and dusk brought magical performances when a symphony of sunrays peeked through or bid adieu to the forest. Lush moss-covered rocks dotted the periphery of the river as its mirror-like surface reflected a beautiful panoramic view of the forest it grazed. A kinship grew between the river and the forest; one providing sustenance to the other and a partnership beautifully balanced and in tandem with the law of nature. Through the day, this harmonic mingling of elements conveyed an illusion of serene silence, hiding the dynamic vitality housed within. From that day forward, the bond between the forest that grew near the river held steadfast, symbolizing a symbiosis that was both beguiling and profound.

Identify the analogies between the following 2 stories:

Story1: Perplexed, Adam sat, enshrouded in layers of questions swirling around like fall leaves in a windstorm. The gravity of the crisis overwhelmed him, its source buried in intricate tales, wailing their dirge of a world soon to bleed into chaos. Every ticking second injected the desperation and unpredictability into his bloodstream. His mentor, the cryptic Professor Coleman, always implied that this could happen, but he provided no guidance for unravelling its etymology. Adam knew he had the intelligence to comprehend this unfolding chaos, but this situation had careened into areas of understanding so alien to his senses.

Meticulously combing through dusty scrolls and brittle parchments, he attempted to reveal the skeletal structure of this chaos. It was like excavating the bones of an undiscovered species - each moment carrying a grand sense of discovery and deadly unease. As the twilight outside bathed his reading room into an eerie world of monochrome dreams, Adam came upon a passage which seemed to open an insight into the very cradle of this crisis. A grim smile adorned his weary face as realization dawned. Armed with his new understanding, he determinedly set upon navigating a safe path through the ensuing turmoil.

Story2: The little child looked with desiring eyes towards the tantalizing treasures that were kept tantalisingly on the top shelf, beyond the feeble reach of his tiny arms. Those interesting toys and excitingly wrapped gifts sitting so casually on the high altitude that may as well have been the sky for the frustrated little angel. He endeavored over and over again, clambered up the edge of his little wooden stool, but every single time the destiny remained the same - disappointingly just an inch or two out of his heart-aching grasp. His blue eyes watered, not from despair, but from the sheer stubborn determination not to give up. One more attempt, he encouraged himself with steadfast resolve, laboriously stepping up once again onto the precarious surface of the stool. Alas, he slipped and ended up toppling off the chair! The climax wasn't sweet, but in his brave little heart, the audacious intent had transformed this tiny setback into the finest form of resolve. The topple did not shake him but only made him more steadfast to grow taller and finally grab his desires with both his small hands, with victory.

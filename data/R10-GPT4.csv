0,All that glitters is not gold.,"In the small town of Baker's Crest, people lived simple lives, mostly untouched by the allure of wealth and luxury. The quiet town was buzzing one day with the news of a travelling merchant who claimed to sell ""real gold"" artifacts. The townspeople gathered at the market square, attracted by the glinting objects displayed on his cart. 

The items glittered under the sunlight, their sheen unmatched, making everyone believe they were indeed made of gold. The merchant, a persuasive man, told captivating tales of the artifacts being lost treasures of ancient kings. An air of greed and desire blew over the town, as everyone wanted a piece of this assumed wealth. They traded their hard-earned savings for the glittering items, believing they had struck a fortune. 

It was not until a wise old man from the town examined the artifacts closely and declared them to be mere brass, cleverly polished to resemble gold. All the glitter had indeed fooled them, reinforcing the adage, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The realization dawned, leaving the townspeople embarrassed, having learned their lesson the hard way.","150,146,247,287,254,10,80,243,300,268,120,14,78,291,203,119,186,104,171,47,124,48,274,310,205,122,295,60,285,52,127,230,216,15,105,7,111,4,57,313,239,277,331,113,309,320,234,253,227,212,110,63,17,24,161,184,126,188,288,240,262,307,187,306,90,322,276,199,45,16,75,201,3,273,18,258,270,11,139,256,134,145,53,44,196,158,82,170,279,317,59,266,193,328,165,38,6,34,157,27,223,178,293,297,259,98,56,303,137,109,286,255,290,9,121,46,250,332,207,308,167,222,103,213,20,61,97,129,19,54,66,36,123,79,215,206,289,151,30,242,143,12,128,1,5,62,327,93,211,265,130,25,198,8,140,252,37,181,251,138,330,58,229,163,87,81,182,204,31,166,281,142,210,153,156,272,64,269,217,283,176,245,221,85,141,116,2,136,160,180,35,296,315,13,155,99,40,249,275,282","144,187,73,38,145,97,36,154,114,6,78,142,194,12,34,70,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
1,The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks.,"From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.","168,199,323,105,3,260,181,223,289,24,150,138,217,288,147,134,166,5,222,137,141,66,144,242,110,159,322,136,87,154,125,290,339,165,47,13,203,273,128,228,158,57,27,38,41,90,246,12,332,280,214,11,220,67,188,263,10,279,172,270,225,268,29,139,149,48,56,145,113,78,191,129,338,71,127,327,86,294,193,318,321,55,211,51,205,167,0,153,320,277,103,256,15,132,218,299,298,37,2,304,104,9,231,6,177,187,248,324,84,312,210,115,102,233,89,8,293,143,250,21,45,309,61,313,130,201,123,80,42,60,243,334,64,208,98,36,35,40,234,209,14,274,30,59,34,240,112,216,7,65,16,77,81,237,185,25,333,301,176,151,282,4,99,135,230,79,311,22,253,31,17,155,116,317,212,337,63,249,163,186,196,52,257,314,275,39,152,111,183,259,169,239,291,224,106,238,284,264,28,265","87,99,5,162,18,104,149,116,102,57,52,48,36,141,93,151,171","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
2,"The journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like.","The journalist, Richard, had always admired the life of the famous actress, Marianne, from afar. He thought her life was extraordinary, filled with glitz, glamour, and excitement. He imagined her attending exclusive parties, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood elites, and living the high life. One day, he was given an exclusive assignment to write a feature about Marianne's lifestyle.

He was exhilarated and prepared for a deep dive into an extravagant lifestyle. To his surprise, he found Marianne lived a very ordinary life, far removed from what he had envisioned. The glitz and glamour were reserved only for the camera; her real-life was more of sweatpants, books, and quiet nights with her old cat.

She preferred staying at home, cooking her meals, and working on her own scripts. She stayed away from industry parties, citing them as shallow and draining. Richard, after spending a week following her, realized that the life of the famous actress was not as extraordinary as it seemed on the glossy magazine covers; it was far more grounded and normal than he could have ever imagined.","121,233,85,322,232,76,309,289,28,303,143,150,61,14,78,83,179,159,20,218,290,331,140,80,138,235,161,202,147,225,100,166,223,132,329,269,120,49,93,32,209,127,262,35,193,186,109,327,213,30,124,258,101,66,139,102,163,190,279,87,220,73,38,177,208,4,249,58,146,181,9,129,259,51,191,323,7,300,130,13,144,69,50,194,65,97,17,0,68,187,157,230,288,160,23,252,196,231,281,203,216,335,37,45,277,204,10,268,250,168,71,60,33,292,207,3,111,302,195,267,254,212,293,8,171,224,88,240,131,52,119,320,324,67,247,110,270,158,206,246,286,316,174,295,305,296,257,184,314,70,170,333,11,86,242,12,72,336,6,330,106,31,266,135,142,185,306,265,1,198,113,241,22,108,307,312,222,34,148,188,189,228,334,162,321,5,248,315,84,19,287,16,234,116,95,133,275,141,274,15","88,169,116,66,186,159,77,124,71,107,153,156,80,14,200,192,87","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
3,The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.,"Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.","155,41,81,206,202,30,308,115,235,208,88,330,188,223,239,322,263,15,205,189,35,218,69,238,215,9,100,89,162,287,267,19,98,4,12,166,26,160,161,23,117,328,118,99,338,59,198,171,321,284,335,279,316,170,67,331,78,334,183,55,194,249,104,320,16,105,140,74,259,255,190,269,323,38,203,317,241,28,319,2,111,112,56,77,210,79,339,184,270,246,134,156,278,336,106,17,296,96,151,114,280,24,300,212,49,251,302,146,200,122,230,258,87,237,11,226,292,91,277,132,268,39,182,8,227,286,312,176,324,76,179,124,281,315,173,14,201,289,10,283,306,243,85,46,197,224,310,13,135,80,32,157,97,66,288,7,142,158,329,1,282,337,265,34,93,131,276,304,5,149,318,51,86,204,178,271,6,326,94,303,290,68,121,214,0,127,295,107,233,95,291,169,22,25,191,293,229,245,36,307","185,160,80,34,169,177,156,124,26,139,115,35,148,136,18,65,96","2, 11, 16, 25, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39"
4,Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.,"When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.","38,260,64,137,155,185,128,329,2,324,112,309,32,91,270,264,327,293,94,167,12,198,178,119,256,98,79,168,202,160,238,143,76,275,125,205,97,55,127,122,62,3,86,292,276,70,33,133,100,226,305,58,15,177,40,9,104,7,335,173,336,271,95,8,201,13,107,210,37,273,161,332,166,331,152,134,77,44,233,239,61,328,26,279,281,75,192,142,193,49,82,151,66,163,101,244,229,297,16,153,314,319,88,257,225,90,284,111,0,164,237,14,302,175,146,182,156,87,69,269,5,147,28,219,109,247,282,188,240,321,48,129,135,34,72,65,157,80,298,181,131,224,78,39,199,67,114,171,10,288,11,148,1,263,213,299,123,272,121,103,325,50,232,23,180,255,41,261,106,320,83,36,93,183,186,194,132,6,311,52,24,17,139,189,301,74,73,207,315,286,211,56,206,84,116,307,235,126,313,231","109,153,9,42,121,178,58,64,56,149,151,21,66,112,53,99,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

She was incredibly proud of it and often boasted that her rose garden was the best in the entire city. She would lovingly prune the roses every day, her hand skimming over the vibrant hues with a sense of satisfaction and adoration. 

However, anyone who visited Mary's place would be far from impressed. To the outsider's eye, Mary's garden was nothing but ordinary. The roses were indeed beautiful, but they were the common variety that could be found anywhere in the city. 

Her rose bushes were not meticulously manicured, and the arrangement of her plants lacked imagination. There were no benches or fountains, nor were there any artistic sculptures that were often seen in other local gardens. The paths were not lined with charming pebbles, and there was no pergola under which one could rest.

In reality, Mary's garden, despite her pride and joy, was just like any other in the city. But in her eyes, the love and time she invested made it the most extraordinary garden of all.","242,203,254,246,268,44,229,232,153,20,121,142,309,91,101,208,312,284,19,187,73,234,337,125,108,182,237,1,197,63,264,231,35,256,148,93,165,171,53,225,122,94,198,100,253,155,83,188,159,240,296,161,215,110,241,0,136,267,124,61,48,269,26,137,191,65,150,115,46,29,80,43,8,330,14,13,336,7,11,162,300,3,18,69,270,249,227,105,239,172,333,24,138,169,173,168,299,116,9,128,79,34,52,167,194,206,86,102,207,319,6,40,21,279,49,163,133,147,175,15,67,218,257,62,95,89,306,301,78,209,39,228,205,224,68,17,41,72,158,259,252,271,332,2,329,204,178,261,202,235,31,42,71,201,294,149,276,74,130,126,134,103,251,310,10,255,4,119,176,12,92,181,107,180,56,54,289,291,295,75,38,154,131,33,334,308,104,16,127,193,135,57,106,84,66,109,262,316,144,97","56,28,144,82,167,111,78,73,99,165,79,170,76,75,120,188,136","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
6,Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.,"Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.","183,77,214,145,38,13,287,53,66,190,256,93,148,219,44,288,94,47,188,330,307,119,225,187,266,5,49,74,142,122,92,26,177,106,220,334,209,123,108,294,161,240,63,196,297,140,300,101,25,11,246,133,238,223,10,88,272,34,310,184,3,295,83,70,275,285,259,135,129,151,314,299,328,100,113,305,61,165,243,197,332,167,159,241,337,163,131,302,217,23,324,210,298,186,35,331,121,116,164,52,222,102,72,284,174,321,120,204,40,303,308,153,4,138,16,291,229,32,57,55,62,254,2,292,141,312,14,1,178,253,233,7,200,289,112,152,237,198,201,281,180,327,111,316,0,333,317,104,134,248,157,270,279,258,87,150,41,276,323,29,162,329,191,221,149,69,336,27,91,45,127,273,144,274,160,12,242,304,95,227,37,17,228,171,8,75,203,296,60,98,309,86,315,206,9,15,236,65,226,147","145,128,123,61,113,26,132,185,195,55,50,176,6,127,196,115,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire. Meet James Harrison, a self-made millionaire who lives in New York City. He made his fortune in the tech industry but chose to remain humble and unassuming despite his wealth. 

Every morning, he puts on the same attire: a plain black t-shirt, khaki pants, and worn-out sneakers. To the average eye, he appears to be just another face in the crowd. He spends his days not in opulent boardrooms, but rather in quaint cafes, where he is always absorbed in either a novel or his laptop, ever curious and eager to learn. 

James prefers solitude and discretion over the fanfare associated with high society. He believes that true worth isn't measured by the price tag on your clothes but by the richness of your character and the value you bring to society. At the end of the day, James Harrison, in his simple clothes, is far more than a millionaire; he's a millionaire with a purpose.","93,139,59,189,212,274,29,336,261,264,286,174,201,322,3,134,232,230,110,200,334,273,275,214,184,271,187,132,238,312,135,217,4,226,229,117,308,316,306,156,52,128,81,281,159,98,67,37,0,49,24,68,151,154,18,221,115,119,89,90,84,220,15,193,183,112,250,25,58,56,162,277,235,79,291,9,141,65,32,317,30,241,71,288,247,124,92,222,106,2,329,262,5,337,88,231,63,10,165,309,259,6,8,42,252,14,292,181,310,219,295,177,258,12,75,17,36,74,169,173,338,66,331,204,48,296,16,197,39,236,168,27,191,251,198,46,266,279,72,327,182,223,294,263,155,35,270,209,210,166,100,23,293,103,153,171,243,45,1,176,224,285,303,91,34,13,22,233,228,170,332,108,300,167,44,299,127,240,62,280,145,207,130,114,196,237,276,333,245,11,133,218,192,131,253,301,248,328,150,96","49,159,90,15,33,93,102,103,76,98,190,114,166,106,63,127,116","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
8,"Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.","Although Lexi looks like an airhead, with her constantly changing hair color and an inexplicable love for oversized, flashy accessories, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met. Her quirky appearance always manages to take people by surprise when she voices her thoughts. We first crossed paths at a local café, where Lexi was wearing a sunflower crown and sporting a bright blue hair. I remember overhearing her conversation with the elderly man at the next table, about the geopolitical ramifications of a recent election.

Even though her flashy appearance said otherwise, her intellect and insight were evident in her every word. Lexi's wisdom extends beyond politics. She can, in one moment, discuss the finer points of classical literature, then easily switch to explaining the complexities of quantum physics or debating the abstract philosophies of life. 

Being around her, I began to understand the depth of her knowledge and the breadth of her understanding. It was a lesson to not judge someone by their appearance, because here was Lexi, vibrant and quirky, yet full of wisdom that could put the wisest of scholars to shame. Despite her exterior portraying her as an airhead, Lexi has, and continues to be, a paragon of wisdom and intellect to me.","1,34,19,147,58,36,22,177,276,210,207,227,301,144,23,142,165,270,154,12,9,161,86,332,296,31,261,208,88,29,218,90,167,251,159,220,196,279,50,257,201,247,285,94,43,108,78,57,306,236,260,175,135,305,198,101,151,320,64,120,82,173,309,242,245,292,2,217,229,282,233,143,316,92,300,274,11,15,61,178,297,182,74,113,286,164,67,268,267,134,105,107,335,166,118,0,222,89,32,26,66,54,17,98,27,331,333,91,265,6,275,238,137,244,63,117,271,184,46,115,232,21,223,273,4,339,72,7,249,317,302,33,191,185,287,183,338,215,109,141,322,170,253,310,104,145,230,293,171,180,122,315,307,3,131,235,44,334,250,136,119,181,14,239,246,129,259,216,277,62,116,41,252,65,290,324,148,266,150,149,24,311,188,199,84,5,226,52,10,42,194,204,13,18,337,168,16,200,112,291","96,1,67,154,125,186,110,128,21,189,77,20,193,163,78,197,103","1, 3, 7, 14, 17, 21, 25, 34, 41, 50"
9,"Claire always thought that Max was unkind and rude because of his edgy fashion sense. But once she learned how kind and sensitive he was, she was surprised.","Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.","118,180,117,141,7,172,62,145,8,55,63,267,185,39,311,155,336,281,41,312,227,187,61,236,264,87,29,338,125,231,286,261,303,104,66,48,329,335,297,128,106,120,100,115,131,238,47,253,190,228,248,171,146,64,173,119,212,302,13,42,101,176,19,270,252,331,229,206,1,135,157,313,256,28,121,45,318,158,219,72,259,179,191,6,198,225,2,310,88,327,15,181,243,159,332,263,299,197,71,188,254,147,91,317,226,93,245,244,77,130,12,218,142,276,322,217,53,79,330,192,26,177,230,78,216,24,43,11,113,321,258,325,152,94,86,250,67,134,32,308,289,280,3,273,282,200,316,288,38,114,183,239,51,167,105,328,52,211,186,255,102,203,278,240,294,221,14,298,144,279,199,269,70,20,23,220,68,84,56,76,10,182,283,275,293,214,22,251,33,17,5,16,124,83,0,4,304,82,260,319","195,69,87,143,196,191,84,5,9,181,128,111,59,167,91,192,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.","309,114,199,153,170,167,76,9,107,28,279,158,19,206,159,176,284,85,11,13,335,34,328,102,57,226,207,337,163,290,72,123,301,40,139,238,20,101,280,144,115,12,186,108,202,219,103,0,7,16,137,93,214,173,55,172,25,194,136,188,84,86,254,4,221,119,133,183,3,198,131,18,201,252,288,138,211,14,100,1,48,89,242,157,189,74,324,135,63,245,109,161,286,175,33,277,217,129,278,185,257,315,17,132,45,98,275,258,266,261,15,291,225,30,150,260,112,310,224,5,92,27,220,216,169,38,97,52,8,124,154,329,187,237,246,61,191,297,249,128,240,2,283,81,241,47,152,294,82,182,22,281,267,251,209,320,184,197,6,304,178,23,247,215,31,165,174,264,164,134,181,292,319,299,192,156,296,227,327,316,179,73,285,313,166,322,270,62,35,91,336,268,56,145,111,234,95,273,203,289","48,80,142,69,64,120,159,49,129,8,19,42,20,78,111,50,103","With determination, he rummaged through his desk drawers and found a simple ballpoint pen.

11,"Don't trust everything on the social media. It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.","Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy. 

However, one day, she stumbled upon an article with the title: ""Don't trust everything on social media."" Intrigued, Emily delved deeper. The article pointed out that many posts on social media are often enhanced, staged, or even completely fake. It pointed out the ubiquity of photo-editing apps and deceitful captions used by people to portray a better version of their lives. The realization hit Emily like a ton of bricks.

From that day forward, Emily took every glamorous post she saw with a grain of salt, knowing they could be far removed from reality. She no longer allowed herself to be bogged down by the apparent euphoria exhibited by others online, instead focusing on building her own contentment in the real world. It was a simple reminder, but one that brought her a great deal of peace: social media is a deceptive lens, and life behind the screen isn't always as perfect as it seems.","59,24,15,252,222,92,316,156,310,195,9,12,35,251,268,10,64,314,302,306,36,122,27,182,249,178,129,58,294,202,19,30,333,320,54,55,326,18,134,97,236,193,265,165,48,173,205,203,50,96,3,285,240,75,280,33,239,153,2,125,196,77,290,275,78,80,4,126,106,210,336,131,14,170,213,247,208,81,149,43,21,118,272,245,46,25,330,194,151,76,180,13,112,260,223,141,49,1,172,329,303,135,34,109,105,159,132,167,218,144,166,204,57,175,38,246,181,29,312,284,51,95,0,8,300,315,293,20,121,22,279,319,200,138,104,176,174,148,274,304,119,127,161,163,209,82,147,56,6,124,157,140,39,286,283,281,5,91,226,207,23,288,307,152,94,235,116,164,328,233,323,219,120,234,201,297,162,72,42,113,45,324,237,289,7,111,17,313,188,250,130,16,99,295,334,321,325,68,335,74","123,98,59,51,67,157,149,185,124,11,16,12,92,73,3,192,187","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17"

Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Perhaps then, I would be researching in a lab or writing a thesis, far removed from the politics and monotony of corporate life. 

I often find myself imagining a life in an academic institution surrounded by books and great minds, pushing the boundaries of knowledge.

And it's not just about escaping my current predicament, it's about doing something fulfilling and being a part of something bigger. 

However, I must admit that I might have romanticized the whole concept of pursuing a higher degree. The late nights working on a research paper, the pressure to publish, the uncertainty of grants and fellowships – these are aspects I conveniently overlook while daydreaming. Besides, having spent a significant amount of time in a corporate setting, I have gained practical knowledge and insights that an academic path might not have provided. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side, and it's easy to long for what we don't have while ignoring the value of what we do have.","97,185,84,286,101,85,102,68,243,150,215,273,157,226,92,334,14,41,313,171,200,317,263,288,29,242,182,32,290,70,65,339,272,19,322,287,43,218,163,267,198,162,271,53,46,274,67,121,155,55,116,320,130,307,326,232,123,30,5,194,77,80,47,275,237,195,27,199,173,140,15,240,4,187,8,78,222,151,83,281,295,257,289,111,227,224,17,329,66,205,244,170,239,183,39,1,148,59,139,284,225,314,37,115,21,228,76,135,3,48,113,22,303,204,117,293,179,231,236,276,51,217,160,96,119,20,7,234,11,316,69,219,306,90,94,38,0,18,73,71,296,99,324,10,305,6,264,180,280,103,152,337,44,315,247,221,34,153,137,75,61,40,202,149,159,9,304,265,241,161,256,253,255,134,141,201,318,16,249,56,88,144,81,186,109,209,52,106,176,169,167,207,2,114,214,269,60,297,13,156","137,96,193,109,73,59,146,127,75,166,144,129,199,17,71,178,87","1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 19, 20, 21, 25, 30"
13,The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.,"Once, there was an accomplished lawyer named Robert. He was highly respected in his field, winning cases with an uncanny ease and expertise. However, he grew tired of the endless lawsuits, the constant debating, and the late-night preparation for trials. He yearned for a drastic change, something that could offer him a chance at a different lifestyle.

One day, Robert made a decision that shocked his colleagues. He quit his prestigious job as a lawyer and decided to return to university to obtain an MBA degree. He believed this degree would offer him better job opportunities and a less stressful life. The idea of working within a corporate environment, negotiating deals, and creating business strategies excited him.

However, his aspirations soon met with a harsh reality. After graduating, he found himself lost in an oversaturated job market, struggling to find a place where his new skill set would be valued as much as his old one. He began to realize that every career had its challenges, and it wasn't about chasing what seemed to be better, but rather, finding contentment in what one already has. His journey to become an MBA graduate, although enlightening, did not provide the solution he had hoped for.","10,195,153,99,33,58,21,161,87,234,136,260,223,155,286,18,273,17,138,165,318,230,299,110,275,40,188,36,180,292,277,11,169,8,296,338,135,77,45,210,124,172,337,246,294,152,154,145,167,68,330,222,47,117,52,89,142,35,324,206,15,113,133,291,225,106,191,70,119,76,129,46,56,108,157,200,176,216,123,95,78,5,132,158,50,233,44,101,198,333,16,130,69,7,6,80,240,229,313,170,28,319,221,290,209,1,29,105,258,265,285,94,332,215,73,164,100,303,42,114,203,256,322,317,204,323,0,190,307,72,268,289,276,90,315,121,197,32,302,326,14,267,91,177,310,61,12,264,293,4,306,278,308,263,283,199,131,41,107,279,134,328,194,217,83,75,243,48,156,282,125,3,232,245,227,271,214,202,192,329,116,9,127,120,231,186,309,2,184,331,213,300,74,173,274,65,82,149,93,97","127,106,188,172,150,82,95,94,34,182,1,32,147,141,61,91,18","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
14,John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.,"John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.","281,265,114,318,313,220,116,7,56,271,44,50,13,84,131,9,295,324,282,197,314,153,87,102,156,259,210,53,16,237,77,138,151,110,10,127,228,155,290,181,227,213,101,291,302,46,120,172,122,137,150,143,89,216,55,135,199,251,8,299,194,132,303,164,3,187,105,159,284,67,306,106,296,133,32,193,20,66,297,316,35,5,142,64,24,169,80,104,305,33,128,246,54,300,173,217,12,72,276,113,301,74,160,94,205,146,115,124,165,17,226,75,336,141,99,22,163,147,190,49,242,63,338,328,0,288,90,47,325,174,315,71,206,60,154,182,91,57,86,112,39,2,270,175,267,78,109,245,83,58,70,207,249,144,11,108,304,15,48,4,21,168,1,262,233,327,98,96,186,261,241,326,321,234,258,62,167,121,253,269,40,294,6,192,322,100,59,334,130,264,161,311,229,285,19,231,224,30,320,27","125,163,142,65,160,82,183,8,59,16,35,155,97,13,158,29,110","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
15,It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.,"When some people see my Instagram feed, the beautiful snapshots of foreign landscapes and exotic food, they always say, ""It looks like fun."" And yes, there are moments that are incredibly exciting and fulfilling. But there's an untold reality to this adventurous facade that often gets overlooked. In reality, it is a struggle to move to a different country. 

It’s not just about adjusting to the new scenery or getting lost in translation. It's the deep-rooted homesickness that never seems to go away. It's missing your family's comfort, your friends' laughter, and the familiarity of your home. It’s the feeling of alienation while trying to fit in a culture so different from your own. 

So while you may look at my life and see an unending vacation, remember to count your blessings. The stability, comfort, and sense of belonging that comes with being home is a privilege not everyone enjoys. Cherishing that is more important than any far-flung adventure.","28,13,60,234,176,310,12,328,118,325,298,37,312,33,95,231,301,127,94,24,219,187,209,268,321,180,10,74,65,262,80,326,11,217,313,49,96,19,255,16,113,131,205,221,269,278,299,192,264,302,181,223,17,79,157,283,75,216,98,84,54,63,3,244,68,146,126,34,91,303,105,213,327,110,78,322,93,172,330,114,4,186,159,14,163,195,335,227,291,32,198,334,178,179,272,30,284,90,7,207,142,108,51,276,59,42,2,103,139,338,101,247,119,282,92,259,43,112,229,8,56,336,233,31,35,267,214,254,258,77,232,1,261,0,164,23,161,67,249,70,304,271,99,270,251,171,45,183,203,320,9,199,162,306,174,88,69,257,324,6,184,252,122,245,168,228,115,260,323,210,158,248,170,81,47,72,226,130,5,316,26,253,124,145,190,104,241,243,143,230,211,21,277,250,57,289,274,194,212,58","134,132,107,63,81,179,160,99,120,151,27,33,7,2,84,40,53","2, 7, 14, 19, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 31"

Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.","208,328,153,104,56,31,297,146,94,200,229,215,93,44,263,123,314,220,236,216,184,87,201,120,311,242,22,192,39,193,305,67,150,250,54,180,194,113,265,58,130,142,109,230,4,320,57,149,131,41,26,75,60,168,224,246,330,307,203,80,197,244,333,228,49,290,137,251,125,199,270,248,10,185,7,76,310,23,50,189,96,195,84,296,118,2,1,292,219,61,231,83,114,69,30,317,19,100,90,3,12,13,89,198,72,274,188,206,42,82,79,308,288,102,141,260,245,6,202,160,62,28,237,107,140,139,171,227,223,51,178,163,164,45,11,316,155,73,74,329,98,286,157,71,91,15,17,277,204,222,33,35,14,259,173,249,276,302,339,136,298,213,210,299,176,103,334,127,225,319,77,88,312,108,187,147,101,132,97,106,53,165,46,116,152,95,214,9,133,322,59,172,5,291,336,186,111,8,321,0","200,87,86,100,45,193,118,75,198,188,73,135,101,102,153,146,147","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
17,She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.,"Every day when she woke up, Jennifer looked through her window and admired her neighbor's home. She thought it was more attractive than her own whenever she turned to look at it. It was a resplendent Victorian mansion with an abundance of gables, a porch that wrapped around the entire front, and immaculate, manicured hedges that lined the driveway. There were vibrantly colored flowers placed expertly throughout the garden, and the white picket fence added an element of charm that she felt her own home lacked.

Jennifer's house, a modest bungalow, was far from unappealing, but paled in comparison to her neighbor's palatial abode. She spent countless hours fussing over her humble garden and undertaking DIY projects to make her home look more like the one across the street. Yet her efforts seemed to fall short every time.

One day, Jennifer struck up a conversation with her neighbor, Ms. Hawthorne. The older woman shared that the upkeep of her lavish home was quite demanding, requiring daily maintenance, considerable expenditure, and constant attention to detail. In that moment, Jennifer realized that while the neighbor's home may have been more attractive, it was certainly more difficult to keep up. She learned to appreciate her own home's charm, realizing its lower maintenance was a blessing in disguise.","317,40,137,2,136,81,107,138,239,183,256,58,262,237,96,258,298,308,157,159,24,156,194,56,92,82,168,105,332,190,99,10,41,11,214,133,301,310,45,135,6,84,229,3,119,20,5,78,89,267,35,127,319,174,250,224,147,218,85,296,98,222,94,86,312,49,270,36,95,225,297,336,321,234,235,144,287,53,231,295,14,232,33,306,4,299,176,223,197,266,37,184,261,15,303,149,0,285,251,64,51,171,202,272,173,97,29,160,248,325,265,139,288,130,62,158,313,338,286,80,19,23,161,1,9,26,151,189,193,114,32,252,69,150,73,27,44,63,66,55,249,328,322,7,88,307,68,61,259,143,129,275,331,103,292,121,274,264,315,180,220,13,165,199,179,257,115,241,302,8,240,203,326,228,140,75,74,50,277,243,200,245,16,324,162,172,198,289,12,300,284,201,255,30,155,52,226,268,227,38","97,124,4,44,85,47,41,144,170,125,32,34,189,162,81,94,183","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
18,After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.,"In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

Veins popped out from his neck as his anger intensified, and his voice echoed like thunder through the silent streets. The crowd around them flinched at his every word, each one sharper and harsher than the last. His rage had controlled him, made him a roaring lion amongst the frightened lambs. But, after spewing out his frustrations, Gerald's storm slowly began to calm. 

He felt a heaviness lift from his chest as he expelled his rage, his mind clearing like the sky after a tempest. After letting off his rage, he sat down like a lamb, his once roaring demeanor replaced with a calm one, realizing that anger was no solution to their problem.","78,324,285,287,162,129,260,22,180,297,127,176,235,122,334,171,177,283,165,138,226,25,118,291,299,288,315,265,93,321,220,203,24,68,172,62,31,15,338,204,91,264,45,319,13,200,145,137,155,300,262,11,267,134,317,309,21,290,49,336,60,173,252,59,23,314,90,7,1,102,187,269,322,99,32,100,92,293,277,151,119,303,26,6,251,206,178,29,335,192,140,216,30,183,312,241,156,292,307,228,218,105,83,94,9,258,133,148,19,48,339,107,289,160,302,236,85,279,34,135,104,313,233,16,111,144,51,326,166,38,98,255,141,75,304,268,185,28,270,208,197,318,191,20,143,230,202,58,306,76,327,157,124,199,242,74,266,237,214,331,61,198,153,248,320,316,109,281,328,8,103,224,97,184,212,39,282,286,169,117,116,167,81,245,47,308,65,337,311,256,188,201,67,275,301,273,209,239,27,196","109,144,57,8,65,33,22,83,199,138,88,93,37","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Sunlight poured down from the cloudless sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the town.

The weather had finally become pleasant following the stormy week, leaving a sense of peace and relief that hung heavy in the air.","151,310,320,333,170,74,337,55,269,76,129,290,36,126,326,128,37,102,280,53,187,150,81,100,109,225,179,107,208,21,212,230,168,46,284,143,149,202,25,197,26,98,103,69,63,112,78,273,75,133,308,252,16,214,33,338,11,286,20,305,97,233,241,4,238,10,266,279,245,288,43,38,191,135,65,302,242,249,246,332,223,84,292,94,108,335,303,58,258,142,59,48,1,287,154,91,67,190,171,267,77,314,237,22,198,321,239,218,138,166,60,162,29,24,13,172,299,210,117,293,15,298,265,216,164,283,93,127,260,66,313,8,235,62,124,189,45,217,262,175,27,229,111,87,35,312,18,131,72,5,270,173,47,219,125,278,315,50,14,86,180,264,250,194,307,201,31,285,119,17,195,256,165,319,282,118,90,23,140,226,169,318,155,30,221,294,211,185,161,99,323,183,316,121,317,145,243,104,328,28","147,59,30,104,178,114,39,41,141,200,113,184,167","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
20,Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.,"Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope.

21,A soft breeze blew after the gust of wind shook down the shacks.,"In the heart of a small, poverty-stricken village, the weather began to take a frightful turn. Ominous grey clouds darkened the sky, casting long, heavy shadows on the poorly built shacks below. Inhabitants of the village huddled inside their homes, bracing for the impending storm. Suddenly, an unrestrained gust of wind blew fiercely, bellowing through the narrow alleys.

The gust was strong and merciless, shaking the frail structures of the shacks as though they were mere toys. One by one, the shacks trembled and creaked under the wind's mighty wrath, their feeble resistance proving futile. Families could only watch helplessly as their homes crumbled around them, swept away by the vengeful gust.

And then, just as quickly as it had arrived, the violent wind ebbed, leaving behind a deafening silence and devastation. A soft breeze blew through the village next, as if nature was seeking to soothe the pain it had caused. The breeze gently kissed the cheeks of the shocked villagers, whispering an apology in their ears, but the fallen shacks were a cruel reminder of the havoc that had been wrought.","336,186,29,200,197,28,126,214,286,168,138,318,196,211,95,195,177,159,24,23,242,46,111,332,104,122,176,277,5,188,163,274,99,222,144,14,306,65,262,62,295,120,30,145,11,19,167,206,74,191,164,175,32,47,333,251,334,202,22,240,165,261,147,119,44,311,220,278,260,298,25,15,317,269,161,40,8,171,152,96,143,42,67,288,255,87,230,105,215,285,241,276,98,209,128,86,26,20,142,131,297,56,294,194,121,102,52,254,141,150,252,184,282,85,78,110,7,18,267,101,93,265,116,166,275,316,228,247,313,249,287,284,309,118,17,339,77,54,305,235,201,229,263,308,136,271,293,127,283,300,331,248,112,320,178,173,234,338,330,57,2,239,154,258,37,224,280,326,4,187,170,324,108,69,156,231,31,94,134,90,272,183,155,174,185,160,307,182,151,205,27,58,266,246,41,107,192,169,223,115","118,46,98,59,20,19,71,97,191,6,3,43,177","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
22,"As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.","The candle had been burning for hours, casting a warm glow across the room, but now its life was ending. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke. The smoke twirled and danced gracefully in the air, a subtle performance of nature, before slowly beginning to dissipate.

To John, who was quietly sitting across the room, this sequence of events felt oddly symbolic. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life - how something so beautiful and vibrant could just vanish in an instant, leaving behind a mere ghost of its existence. 

His mind traveled back to the year his mother had passed away. A once vivacious woman, her flame had too been dimmed by the cruel hands of cancer, leaving behind only memories - ephemeral wisp of smoke to grasp. 

He leaned back, closing his eyes, allowing himself to dive into the deeper depths of his thoughts, feeling the loss once again. He didn't know how long he sat there, lost in his thoughts, but when he opened his eyes again, the wisp of smoke had completely disappeared. The room was now submerged in darkness, the extinguished candle serving as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life.","189,322,197,23,167,79,162,115,317,6,292,146,331,225,203,242,337,157,44,73,125,303,78,65,252,18,88,117,176,238,324,138,335,265,140,26,39,40,142,171,145,139,304,29,103,290,249,128,276,158,310,212,31,192,143,181,228,54,114,92,318,64,56,149,314,202,257,98,160,154,105,241,71,107,172,61,300,209,271,28,275,151,120,27,165,237,220,58,221,235,49,299,121,251,55,295,288,327,186,207,130,316,156,159,147,4,315,35,46,211,87,10,298,297,309,51,169,254,11,43,144,24,102,137,16,269,99,339,193,255,152,284,118,239,267,230,218,17,126,13,0,21,233,308,243,190,191,323,205,313,198,36,301,232,274,217,95,173,302,76,170,33,270,67,30,338,3,19,129,83,214,247,122,279,174,166,253,244,180,135,155,250,163,74,183,240,185,20,188,229,25,328,245,291,150,14,325,89,296,47","26,168,188,142,4,122,191,36,84,80,44,165,53","As the cards were laid out, Derek's straight flush in spades triumphed over all.

23,He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.,"At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.","260,132,26,338,302,106,318,210,135,234,25,94,24,306,238,227,62,154,169,212,328,43,236,14,187,17,269,271,215,319,69,125,219,54,161,86,160,32,133,178,153,262,324,52,233,186,146,327,22,18,104,142,156,30,182,3,265,267,278,5,53,253,183,11,331,60,119,36,91,333,99,118,185,204,130,263,101,162,166,87,131,39,79,200,76,139,111,56,113,152,216,100,290,13,250,0,249,126,259,27,149,239,75,330,228,148,223,116,48,288,124,38,147,6,314,108,208,190,317,46,297,229,28,312,217,137,335,226,16,145,281,37,68,136,20,339,284,9,261,294,248,280,237,21,114,194,304,123,206,82,307,207,268,277,81,292,192,266,67,279,315,296,8,184,321,61,140,246,90,29,134,291,103,143,167,55,283,286,298,84,121,222,92,270,231,252,63,42,151,285,293,300,85,171,31,115,193,170,19,128","50,199,135,144,49,13,11,3,100,123,170,54,195","1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17"
24,My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.,"Max, my pet dog, is an energetic and playful soul. He has a great fondness for games, with his favorite being frisbee. Our routine was the same every day; as soon as I would get back from work, we would head straight to the park. This park, just a few blocks away, was Max's paradise.

Today was no different; we spent the whole day running around, chasing and tossing the frisbee under the warm sun. Max was the star of the park, darting around like a whirlwind with his bright red frisbee. He would leap into the air, trying to snatch the frisbee before it touched the ground, displaying his athleticism and enthusiasm.

As the sun began to set, we started our walk back home. The whole day of energetic play was evident on Max; he was panting hard but had an unmistakable gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Now, after a long day full of fun and games, my pet dog Max is down for the count, snoring softly in his corner, probably dreaming about another day full of frisbee fun.","92,174,308,338,68,136,90,218,11,118,332,20,267,271,26,239,104,303,65,95,100,126,279,307,231,224,265,54,284,246,262,109,266,115,74,50,134,188,316,222,139,150,156,257,63,221,151,73,334,167,277,328,212,179,294,23,297,160,17,276,166,76,190,183,137,37,191,18,173,215,69,77,228,143,112,180,130,229,206,172,281,105,125,302,240,1,48,81,216,58,98,147,306,177,148,16,162,78,84,255,189,21,75,325,31,309,51,93,60,201,225,101,29,10,234,313,45,72,70,153,192,22,310,25,288,263,122,196,87,305,194,291,256,140,59,19,299,219,152,175,124,223,330,170,274,322,154,28,149,15,64,226,283,260,108,199,250,178,4,159,158,203,27,261,238,312,295,132,131,107,155,79,116,35,146,337,38,5,236,3,142,207,86,30,301,83,315,202,193,157,184,335,164,282,42,232,252,331,326,176","68,136,12,102,122,56,124,15,163,148,113,184,105","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
25,Their company is so debt-ridden due to erratic management that I think it's safe to say they're about to go bankrupt.,"Once upon a time, there was a flourishing tech company named Digitech, known for its innovative solutions and game-changing technology. However, over the years, their strategic management started losing its grip. The company's focus shifted from enhancing their technology and pleasing customers to mindless expansion and reckless spending. Gradually, the consequences began to appear in the company's financial health.

Digitech started to sink into an abyss of debts due to this erratic management. They kept on acquiring more and more loans to cover their extravagant expenses, creating a vicious cycle. It got to a point where the debts were so astronomical that they overshadowed the company's worth. The company was so debt-ridden that there seemed to be no silver lining in sight.

The staff grew anxious with the looming bankruptcy, and their efficiency dropped considerably. Looking at the horrid financial state and the demotivated employees, I thought it was safe to say that Digitech was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy. It was a painful sight seeing such a once vibrant company facing a downfall due to mismanagement and imprudence.","30,119,197,117,178,36,303,70,78,179,18,280,283,157,42,114,201,196,277,48,312,271,298,90,120,258,85,206,255,28,310,316,26,74,14,139,93,339,121,118,155,95,132,176,171,265,116,106,236,108,31,41,29,318,113,323,284,189,13,123,233,302,24,133,223,186,289,234,315,58,185,187,256,112,180,264,17,144,53,1,232,128,145,89,4,334,105,2,253,122,22,300,259,97,99,306,307,175,279,104,115,286,294,204,275,268,77,251,129,27,156,69,8,16,135,54,34,287,242,20,167,221,269,225,151,60,220,319,127,328,21,11,190,19,278,23,62,80,174,195,212,110,321,192,272,260,230,173,257,229,237,214,147,273,79,39,297,301,68,166,125,336,152,309,295,211,103,261,183,313,38,262,248,107,91,202,254,61,182,266,200,209,100,325,111,224,158,159,216,45,87,240,333,52,55,288,293,141,153,231","11,134,120,131,91,136,63,33,110,30,53,1,51","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
26,"On his last birthday, Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight.","On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.","102,49,312,23,153,223,10,20,289,318,310,48,278,327,197,322,339,148,329,144,138,24,94,128,131,326,246,95,69,84,3,272,304,29,104,156,27,290,60,205,303,230,182,201,50,77,139,264,225,183,159,232,70,331,227,189,279,229,288,75,206,187,286,321,228,25,90,196,328,72,30,194,334,200,332,51,33,301,161,308,150,121,154,251,162,266,111,129,68,105,110,22,17,297,135,167,226,292,46,108,233,19,179,160,212,118,137,237,126,170,261,41,280,152,330,221,151,45,97,0,239,119,190,18,209,123,305,158,157,218,21,171,234,178,252,120,306,99,122,315,256,319,299,267,66,275,285,257,9,4,188,165,244,254,106,211,214,82,243,63,112,224,333,241,52,133,15,245,193,163,32,127,31,253,73,204,130,37,117,115,136,294,236,14,88,181,216,44,263,287,240,176,302,103,195,295,335,317,28,249","124,102,8,131,92,4,22,66,37,199,34,71,173","You reassured me that family comes first and that we could always reschedule our day out.

Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.","135,116,333,176,191,262,113,31,336,202,66,129,123,299,142,208,261,79,28,228,53,112,249,250,303,92,326,309,78,229,95,271,124,86,128,284,72,64,45,43,21,83,300,236,281,201,96,287,30,205,197,16,192,2,258,283,150,198,171,308,311,0,146,324,286,133,314,240,120,33,199,130,263,81,216,104,8,168,166,141,225,149,88,312,170,94,339,144,210,172,335,22,44,9,212,164,325,327,289,70,137,288,71,173,134,47,195,25,254,215,218,188,251,18,292,317,56,278,207,159,275,260,193,265,328,131,231,206,103,256,227,155,313,187,237,331,59,23,305,126,97,310,10,82,121,80,183,239,321,37,211,280,127,24,105,34,115,74,91,161,54,13,156,185,203,226,29,222,296,41,89,180,20,179,241,19,58,255,322,109,214,304,132,174,154,42,46,181,217,182,268,125,209,3,145,84,163,294,26,48","114,176,173,41,92,138,154,108,199,19,167,49,8","4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49"
28,"Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.","Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal. 

Laura is a dedicated artist, consumed by her work and often forgetting to take a break. Today was no different. She had started her marathon early in the morning. The sun had barely risen when she set up her easel and palette. Now, as the last rays of the setting sun seeped through the studio window, she lay exhausted on the floor.

Despite my insistence, she refused to get up for several minutes. The artistic satisfaction coursing through her veins seemed to outweigh the physical fatigue. I admired her dedication, as Laura proved yet again, that for her, art wasn't just a hobby but a way of life.","58,306,279,194,96,15,26,48,72,247,276,227,236,333,39,177,32,239,167,206,119,155,129,37,68,92,127,21,138,197,230,98,99,17,324,147,36,121,142,275,30,304,291,136,255,309,126,311,43,164,116,182,290,8,95,257,189,73,334,210,50,159,134,106,327,18,185,110,180,285,133,297,328,115,245,3,226,178,137,75,300,235,88,80,87,130,192,277,160,225,55,246,336,51,286,29,261,231,338,151,172,262,24,83,27,52,248,124,102,97,145,270,41,252,200,158,191,228,45,259,302,65,222,332,64,218,176,299,69,195,10,315,90,321,312,260,308,196,93,148,66,146,320,232,175,181,122,317,223,249,211,337,23,135,310,314,117,238,54,108,19,131,33,113,186,282,31,325,56,152,331,84,169,272,254,173,170,322,1,49,318,86,22,79,14,104,111,157,20,71,307,40,174,330,82,213,25,101,284,163","66,161,189,28,183,153,103,197,7,105,96,41,167","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11"
29,Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.,"Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.","25,214,144,53,66,58,296,161,86,22,48,207,21,72,7,232,20,205,143,104,236,14,334,276,98,300,200,305,95,229,293,280,267,17,59,323,57,290,320,24,41,328,222,260,146,321,97,292,50,65,91,217,289,258,133,152,35,127,301,19,338,270,96,82,124,176,51,190,15,216,211,120,54,287,269,310,246,126,226,180,257,185,42,261,204,278,275,168,241,192,125,164,244,106,93,202,294,114,238,316,333,324,122,253,330,255,282,64,39,142,311,157,55,44,67,162,4,5,288,108,291,28,172,286,233,37,262,36,90,274,239,219,304,264,309,336,23,31,46,132,189,116,206,6,128,30,160,327,182,150,266,34,326,77,137,187,100,247,302,196,197,231,121,138,220,145,268,123,1,221,188,285,165,84,329,243,27,147,10,83,299,153,26,63,225,61,263,297,215,103,265,112,99,80,18,159,101,92,117,140","195,60,17,13,10,137,40,1,183,177,122,146,138","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
30,After working two years for the company she was burned out.,"Elizabeth had been a dedicated employee of Wilmont & Co. for two long years. She had joined the company as a fresh-faced graduate, ready to conquer the corporate world with her innovative ideas and infectious enthusiasm. Initially, she loved the challenges her job as a financial analyst presented, enjoyed the camarity with her colleagues, and thrived on the intensity of her work.

However, as time passed, the novelty wore off and the pressures started to mount. Projects began to pile up, deadlines became tighter, and the lines between her personal and professional lives blurred. Elizabeth found herself pouring over financial reports at midnight, attending virtual meetings during her breakfast time, and responding to business emails on weekends. She was always on call, always available, always working.

After enduring this relentless grind for two years, Elizabeth felt a profound exhaustion that no amount of sleep could mend. The once passionate and driven professional, was now just a burned-out shell of her former self. She looked at the company emblem on her screen one day, and realized that she was worn out to the core, understanding that it wasn't just her job she was tired of but her entire life within the company.","90,126,115,124,63,72,254,172,102,219,32,301,266,74,1,308,20,5,316,288,160,338,101,150,28,167,312,257,234,25,106,151,162,246,323,200,107,15,9,84,11,217,146,69,229,299,240,243,109,325,113,31,125,29,294,336,92,285,171,253,38,22,56,14,183,91,97,192,269,227,153,223,45,128,293,278,194,144,165,43,76,208,295,303,4,319,188,214,218,271,148,222,225,2,206,252,220,37,302,205,80,297,255,177,95,141,120,49,71,263,232,228,187,58,103,296,26,83,270,317,272,131,130,211,33,23,215,244,236,104,159,210,250,280,273,249,237,54,135,190,21,265,67,18,279,189,41,140,231,260,77,0,320,327,19,212,224,251,328,48,256,178,185,100,198,289,292,53,201,287,290,27,64,57,176,117,333,168,155,24,318,332,193,154,309,7,305,239,181,127,242,262,175,50,119,152,36,298,197,122","144,155,17,141,62,126,180,30,117,172,25,54,52","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
31,He collapsed after he ran for the marathon.,"John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.","62,180,66,88,35,129,285,47,244,294,250,123,138,212,279,50,32,33,140,204,257,207,39,70,87,124,267,218,331,224,261,273,154,333,103,1,146,121,44,283,259,292,64,89,55,115,48,133,85,125,238,19,299,309,237,185,173,215,134,308,41,27,272,175,305,277,36,163,38,282,152,98,197,182,128,131,251,170,171,94,311,20,314,201,219,313,245,268,106,12,56,156,80,260,323,90,188,28,112,52,255,95,109,72,10,102,122,71,137,75,271,332,293,199,270,230,148,9,177,26,161,0,325,15,264,247,289,40,147,18,11,337,202,324,297,316,76,176,86,82,318,127,81,281,17,7,262,42,196,326,142,21,101,214,191,99,303,58,139,24,23,160,74,284,327,288,25,233,149,6,290,174,235,339,57,22,30,178,153,243,29,118,92,61,104,249,240,34,45,108,208,53,210,304,322,93,315,300,276,338","130,52,82,152,176,161,160,167,120,62,98,181,177","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.","332,322,290,57,204,60,3,164,191,328,239,83,119,318,193,12,148,255,104,95,308,66,274,319,86,71,67,165,269,109,79,17,173,201,139,197,49,264,242,143,45,24,141,70,223,55,21,39,291,325,52,252,35,142,13,339,238,266,232,292,23,111,271,231,214,248,72,218,81,54,289,91,118,285,145,121,47,182,172,138,236,273,93,198,222,0,51,327,78,124,90,304,329,229,26,276,33,123,301,265,282,219,99,63,253,259,69,320,196,260,149,170,29,25,166,209,315,272,175,217,107,147,171,132,317,127,36,20,311,37,1,144,192,128,174,303,228,58,283,256,97,337,7,42,245,161,288,40,96,125,113,105,247,240,6,30,102,184,185,178,312,296,116,186,146,221,188,181,213,338,333,211,293,136,16,82,43,140,34,176,64,235,61,207,187,163,226,334,183,4,280,261,41,279,80,85,335,297,38,244","97,179,53,127,130,199,48,148,193,144,177","5, 12, 16, 27, 35, 42, 50, 59, 68, 77"

Suddenly, he was overwhelmed by the memories of their shared laughter, mutual respect, deep conversations, and undeniable comfort. It dawned upon him, the regret hitting him like a punch to the gut, that he had already found his true love in Emily, and he let it slip away, chasing an illusion of love curated by fiction.","34,255,138,199,223,56,21,186,85,116,310,46,129,240,59,188,41,156,225,215,286,16,238,135,269,2,232,165,333,290,268,0,43,113,42,178,61,164,131,206,118,101,175,124,237,207,53,117,132,210,50,281,326,159,40,339,123,75,3,204,30,228,67,295,148,319,140,200,8,36,51,167,313,335,189,82,330,304,262,312,111,218,146,301,62,71,142,230,5,246,181,183,231,49,45,217,168,256,294,18,23,92,48,179,127,195,332,68,311,90,325,292,293,93,216,251,80,106,32,208,270,202,277,338,150,120,249,78,84,102,212,147,289,4,331,162,73,160,234,11,305,314,201,258,194,276,144,171,299,161,323,110,211,306,58,288,318,121,141,72,239,137,35,224,243,39,317,283,143,37,57,76,192,166,296,173,122,184,29,103,193,149,70,99,198,321,197,267,174,91,248,158,220,205,278,104,172,126,264,38","119,1,163,70,170,200,166,55,17,35,33","1, 3, 5, 9, 14, 18, 24, 33, 34, 48"
34,Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.,"For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.","54,70,116,133,141,119,315,31,134,251,125,282,255,71,55,228,149,78,104,236,126,172,266,32,11,101,22,333,111,184,110,338,317,148,98,19,59,97,259,293,123,92,196,15,160,127,215,170,248,17,209,108,193,73,128,146,3,107,6,331,173,328,201,67,232,51,118,35,62,112,323,164,156,295,81,199,246,131,337,43,74,197,294,79,276,208,300,247,136,205,191,174,48,120,147,13,139,299,80,318,218,186,202,114,4,336,301,47,5,254,284,159,229,223,264,140,45,273,287,42,41,326,220,319,153,154,286,310,324,76,249,25,66,87,245,214,29,252,225,137,56,217,307,85,263,33,242,231,253,313,203,37,212,40,44,161,303,233,304,12,20,237,175,227,187,171,94,211,1,339,65,314,200,36,321,267,166,163,260,117,132,151,39,327,181,188,305,38,221,278,86,235,152,335,57,329,296,210,10,102","24,146,68,174,152,188,183,154,121,120,80","2, 5, 6, 7, 14, 17, 19, 26, 27, 30"
35,I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.,"I've been cooking for the majority of my life, and over the years, I've accumulated an impressive array of cooking utensils. Some of them are shiny and new, flaunting an array of fancy features. Lately, there's been a new utensil in the market that's been getting quite a buzz; it's sleek, multifunctional, and apparently worth the hefty price tag. Even so, I'm not tempted.

To me, nothing can replace my old pan. It's a simple, nondescript thing, with a worn-out handle and the faint traces of countless meals. It's this pan that has been my trusty companion in preparing countless family meals and festive feasts.

36,Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.,"As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.","172,199,293,53,248,309,196,124,41,135,66,240,235,20,330,76,300,149,35,125,12,221,246,21,141,289,37,96,339,150,120,280,226,38,260,148,265,233,5,156,274,228,174,34,333,195,136,323,143,106,180,101,234,142,315,275,249,331,163,116,100,146,82,97,14,47,218,19,305,92,65,239,69,25,302,45,270,167,32,98,215,277,319,16,49,205,325,204,334,46,306,112,329,52,258,157,42,151,110,190,133,6,219,68,292,134,276,191,321,2,332,327,197,224,105,192,15,126,84,161,294,322,51,94,185,123,64,225,231,278,313,198,298,40,85,335,254,58,238,262,336,91,86,72,23,279,263,165,1,245,171,43,4,170,273,33,147,175,80,22,73,177,220,48,31,118,267,28,128,286,93,39,131,61,111,176,272,29,203,186,10,213,169,162,184,103,75,83,102,295,281,164,282,0,121,337,223,244,314,138","79,156,44,19,27,34,172,134,9,97,152","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.","20,248,5,265,332,293,108,325,194,23,64,274,249,261,110,321,135,328,317,65,197,10,89,337,200,40,193,316,149,54,286,41,335,220,284,290,142,99,231,333,133,280,173,30,191,58,295,309,178,155,4,278,302,240,21,105,7,35,258,318,104,42,283,219,154,152,230,269,26,102,119,310,146,34,72,271,326,264,277,297,315,266,100,60,238,233,86,324,305,138,294,29,268,137,228,260,189,57,215,111,217,12,272,263,107,153,210,117,172,62,180,76,330,134,254,259,6,51,25,195,299,227,15,164,14,273,43,239,199,82,97,190,0,73,125,112,75,292,237,250,39,127,3,84,308,49,151,188,31,36,145,59,95,204,319,139,85,87,168,11,281,170,225,157,129,38,175,303,53,221,247,81,46,306,16,150,253,296,159,246,79,313,206,289,122,311,50,92,323,90,166,32,91,179,33,115,282,18,187,148","192,195,74,58,150,166,141,26,32,62,127","1, 3, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21"

42,"Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike.","As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.","290,308,82,155,62,177,295,36,325,97,331,210,111,47,11,239,193,20,30,168,299,214,69,114,164,304,293,233,40,196,220,212,100,163,213,6,160,206,337,10,227,137,322,99,260,55,217,50,65,261,335,246,296,3,209,37,276,81,207,78,326,151,46,79,34,29,135,93,92,138,240,187,32,73,169,313,80,218,106,267,216,294,270,77,201,180,330,166,339,4,1,43,320,98,222,54,49,146,23,300,71,88,121,219,235,116,89,279,208,184,2,306,104,173,211,109,198,280,39,175,28,301,200,221,53,286,86,162,41,269,148,178,7,35,291,205,292,258,56,305,245,161,87,336,102,252,287,281,144,149,253,311,85,282,156,15,238,38,174,242,307,18,128,181,147,236,338,272,229,328,91,8,248,314,115,33,107,140,66,297,192,275,318,122,130,273,256,64,268,158,241,319,123,110,75,329,283,165,265,67","73,176,65,134,8,56,158,119,29,129,92","5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24"
43,Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.,"Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.","114,116,73,333,184,174,274,9,238,298,91,272,126,319,50,146,170,228,82,277,32,270,268,104,6,217,119,220,198,203,113,167,335,237,246,173,179,240,261,65,308,33,233,127,191,31,326,297,21,321,84,182,192,136,265,34,162,329,223,149,275,26,100,330,306,232,44,25,163,7,38,236,281,18,286,264,300,139,251,19,60,63,12,288,262,125,234,72,200,93,36,83,323,101,289,131,207,159,8,130,309,156,39,202,61,69,37,55,206,276,303,190,293,134,257,14,287,316,74,66,0,90,164,304,181,78,160,244,331,76,56,142,13,88,183,53,197,108,71,318,259,58,337,166,214,16,67,267,92,177,150,105,239,35,52,320,339,118,98,42,210,86,332,87,40,205,178,23,41,258,155,314,322,161,165,22,107,5,122,128,85,143,51,249,269,271,59,193,294,176,315,103,94,252,295,310,79,263,231,129","21,42,56,154,91,107,71,103,165,169,160","4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15"

I was willing to put in late hours, to work through weekends if necessary. In fact, I was prepared to go beyond my physical and mental boundaries, to stretch my limits. There would be no room for procrastination or distractions in my life.

He understood that achieving this goal would require more than just passing his exams; he'd need to fully dedicate himself to his studies.

Along the way, he was compelled to make several sacrifices. Socializing with friends often took a backseat, as John prioritized his studies above everything else. Long nights that should've been spent enjoying his youth were instead devoted to honing his skills and expanding his knowledge.

His professors often praised him for his diligence, with some even predicting a promising future for him in his chosen field.

In the end, his perseverance paid off. John graduated at the top of his class and managed to land a lucrative job in a prestigious company.

49,"The director finally completed the film, having done everything in his power to get the film released and bankrupting his production company.","Leonard Vincent, an ambitious and tenacious director, had finally completed his most personal film to date. The journey had been long, fraught with a myriad of challenges and setbacks that seemed to conspire against the film's completion. A series of unfortunate events from delayed schedules, increasingly demanding actors, to a catastrophic storm, disrupting the sets. Yet, Leonard showed unyielding determination, devoting every ounce of energy he had in his pursuit.

He poured all resources into the film, driven by the conviction of his creative vision.

His investment didn't just confine to financial; he put his time, sweat, and heart into it, doing everything within his power to get the film released.

I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me.

51,I am determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.,"As October turned into November, I could feel an excitement and slight nervousness bubbling up within me. This year was going to be different because for the first time, I was determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch. Always intimidated by the thought of preparing such a large and traditional meal, I had always opted to order from the local deli or have the family gathering at a restaurant. But not this time, I wanted to bring a personal touch to our family gathering.

My plan was to start with the turkey, then the stuffing, followed by the cranberry sauce, and finish off with an assortment of delightful sides and desserts. Even though it was a mammoth task, I was ready for the challenge. I spent days researching recipes, procuring the freshest ingredients, and practicing my carving skills.

The day arrived, and I was filled with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. It was indeed a whirlwind of activity with the kitchen filled with a delicious aroma, family laughter echoing in the background, and the soulful melody of Thanksgiving songs. At the end of the day, despite the difficulties, the joy I saw on my family's faces while devouring the meal made it all worthwhile. I knew then that it was the beginning of a beautiful tradition, a gesture of love that would be remembered and relished for years to come.","286,220,53,281,71,49,331,251,38,283,37,85,179,315,333,80,138,200,113,75,181,240,121,196,270,225,242,156,126,12,154,163,0,264,47,329,316,171,39,155,82,255,193,313,227,199,164,280,141,131,55,162,224,324,3,335,24,205,317,66,269,330,133,246,176,87,91,241,238,35,104,26,276,107,337,334,305,46,94,204,135,106,195,90,25,124,297,217,77,110,332,114,300,309,327,234,16,115,290,184,148,149,48,323,302,29,289,271,262,182,178,209,258,169,111,284,261,295,144,50,322,97,86,69,207,263,74,282,319,5,40,27,235,236,161,183,197,266,165,214,168,314,54,52,259,103,105,254,99,95,45,239,137,310,23,20,338,152,93,318,34,117,244,79,229,119,83,57,288,22,312,41,151,219,9,174,36,116,252,118,221,76,92,19,42,233,211,102,167,65,232,143,159,243,142,60,132,222,44,67","199,151,78,35,103,6,120,144,3,143,51","5, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27"

He knew that if he wanted to win, he couldn't leave any stone unturned. He would have to prepare tirelessly for the final race, putting each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Every morning, before the sun dared to peep over the horizon, Harry would lace up his running shoes and head for the trails. He took on steep hills, rough terrains and practiced in every weather condition - rain, sunshine, and snow alike. Every drop of sweat that gushed down his face represented his dedication and hard work, only fueling his determination further. He balanced this strenuous training with a well-disciplined diet and sleep schedule.

On rest days, he visualized himself crossing the finish line first, basking in the glory of his hard work. But it wasn't just about winning anymore; the journey had taught him more about perseverance, patience, and his love for the sport. Regardless of the results, he knew that he would cherish these moments spent preparing for the final race for the rest of his life.","250,150,136,323,126,318,57,174,267,12,168,241,243,46,270,259,273,16,105,158,183,109,72,144,70,324,223,76,53,157,175,20,313,95,134,299,208,262,125,322,7,74,68,303,18,195,51,256,167,184,118,128,199,147,164,87,49,48,242,179,47,17,280,268,205,111,219,50,258,339,218,321,86,65,293,188,309,220,137,24,222,140,312,35,124,308,110,45,165,133,39,331,284,97,21,197,77,320,154,66,149,44,37,32,272,249,229,310,330,253,181,33,305,78,187,327,246,15,19,202,192,277,286,217,30,26,194,282,104,307,329,81,255,185,177,100,198,240,316,226,29,131,56,171,314,209,120,203,6,274,269,231,96,54,281,146,55,43,325,294,296,261,161,295,3,64,34,159,230,180,117,103,271,216,129,36,172,248,2,301,204,25,79,328,221,63,156,225,38,92,40,106,121,291,23,22,236,201,14,89","102,88,14,61,58,57,68,47,29,154,157","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.","84,159,198,80,294,171,135,102,276,54,64,213,58,151,36,105,269,215,134,96,224,142,232,164,302,268,74,167,207,254,12,288,146,61,257,67,50,68,170,143,278,29,286,8,337,336,95,290,124,255,155,193,315,329,263,56,178,301,15,331,307,241,24,108,104,249,229,47,272,195,4,129,174,21,245,107,186,5,308,40,316,10,116,79,35,118,231,43,57,136,200,161,46,23,16,339,305,246,260,149,122,211,75,244,223,251,267,27,71,216,192,91,202,44,33,334,28,156,131,93,48,52,140,197,176,49,1,32,110,206,225,112,270,184,9,157,250,277,282,209,42,45,100,97,299,132,111,138,87,60,14,262,13,17,55,281,114,234,86,240,26,18,323,11,318,273,25,313,335,309,175,310,221,115,326,172,303,306,98,120,295,271,144,37,83,214,314,180,236,261,203,252,51,119,85,199,330,218,191,238","114,142,93,68,121,126,37,193,122,10,155","7, 10, 13, 22, 31, 33, 34, 37, 39, 40"
54,I was completely against nationalization. I resisted it wholeheartedly even though I became quite unpopular in the process.,"From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling. The concept of the government taking over privately-owned industries was deeply unsettling to me. It wasn't just a matter of economic principles; it was an assault on individual freedoms.

As a vocal critic, I resisted nationalization wholeheartedly. I wrote articles, gave speeches, and even attended heated political debates. I tried to warn others about the dangers of state ownership, how it discourages innovation, stifles competition, and potentially jeopardizes the rights of workers and consumers.

However, my unpopular stance made me an outsider. My acquaintances viewed my resistance as a lack of patriotism or a result of selfish capitalist views. In the process, I became quite unpopular, isolated from those who once respected me.

However, I chose to stand by my principles. I refused to bend to the popular opinion. I felt it was more important to defend what I believed to be true than to be popular. If anything, the experience hardened my resolve and confirmed to me the importance of holding firm to one's convictions, regardless of the cost.","125,290,300,44,266,287,122,34,224,119,246,46,199,209,124,188,268,26,283,216,135,101,193,206,129,63,94,1,276,58,15,128,77,318,131,338,28,72,195,112,64,299,275,293,116,43,298,320,301,249,173,45,163,19,130,93,240,38,71,82,222,303,10,79,183,5,85,201,233,234,170,284,319,151,37,236,210,89,203,33,123,327,335,280,114,228,8,265,330,47,146,23,232,181,247,326,40,4,50,337,51,207,244,148,296,21,264,292,2,317,279,106,285,154,229,217,189,86,158,239,29,27,78,250,313,111,92,289,144,308,149,167,68,172,35,83,208,316,273,133,231,196,155,245,104,134,269,309,160,270,41,143,73,87,288,20,70,18,52,278,258,84,30,17,194,49,277,60,162,24,307,220,333,253,91,16,295,274,42,175,22,55,321,48,205,213,12,76,312,291,138,53,257,99,168,281,324,56,198,11","4,52,12,90,184,166,99,101,159,192,182","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
55,Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.,"Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.

56,"The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.","Ever since I was a little kid, I've always had an insatiable curiosity for the world. My parents tried to answer my million questions, but they often found it hard to explain certain concepts to me. Then, they began showing me pictures and drawings, and that was when my understanding grew. I remember distinctly, the drawing that introduced me to the concept of the solar system.

The drawing showed me at one glance, what a book could only show me in many pages. At first glance, I saw colorful planets orbiting a radiant sun, each with their own distinct patterns and sizes. The earth, a blue dot, placed third from the sun made me comprehend our position in the universe. The distinct rings of Saturn, the redness of Mars, the size of Jupiter, all seemed to tell their own story.

Those simple illustrations sparked a fascination in me for the cosmos and it was far more effective than any description in a book. Thus, a picture became my stepping stone to the infinite world of knowledge, proving that sometimes, one glance can offer insight a thousand words may fail to give.","206,243,100,265,279,99,82,11,131,57,309,182,167,80,153,59,193,14,294,252,331,290,217,42,158,189,197,31,337,163,177,327,169,194,336,238,71,135,207,113,205,188,334,191,174,121,274,242,239,253,183,199,257,209,232,244,141,130,161,295,2,308,160,170,156,247,249,289,72,258,101,78,13,213,112,58,173,122,211,328,61,333,84,302,221,91,124,119,267,164,241,303,94,67,107,68,20,178,62,49,52,225,226,283,47,35,304,261,63,26,125,339,55,12,288,142,79,111,329,28,201,335,60,15,37,297,237,65,25,10,143,132,277,127,115,155,162,203,312,73,220,315,282,166,284,233,30,256,187,260,75,117,3,76,16,235,306,108,157,81,39,21,251,286,176,38,144,45,311,318,140,246,128,109,323,70,269,338,93,102,48,179,204,186,202,293,275,54,116,208,147,313,53,223,264,29,74,9,90,195","10,76,16,123,81","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
57,I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.,"As an avid movie lover, I've always appreciated the beauty of cinema more than literature. A couple of weeks ago, my friend, a passionate reader, recommended an epic fantasy series to me. She exclaimed, ""You just have to read these books. The story is enchanting!"" However, the thought of reading five massive volumes was daunting. Each book, she said, was a thousand pages of intricate world-building, nuanced character development, and twisting plotlines. The time commitment alone was overwhelming. 

With some research, I discovered that a film adaptation had been made of the entire series. It intrigued me more than the prospects of wading through stacks of books. So, I decided to spare myself the cumbersome task of reading the novels and simply watch the adaptation. ""I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on,"" I informed her, much to her horror and my relief.","285,28,30,13,327,93,261,99,317,224,78,159,313,49,316,303,160,210,207,85,322,229,53,236,176,267,101,59,163,88,220,180,173,117,127,26,288,38,281,81,100,158,39,330,45,240,256,311,246,42,183,124,190,221,77,55,27,233,63,8,286,34,280,321,318,257,266,225,138,274,15,5,312,33,299,102,60,333,227,325,319,203,270,132,136,277,115,186,162,105,82,166,161,211,14,310,128,315,293,71,104,181,175,19,226,75,252,4,196,10,187,107,237,125,295,309,56,290,98,67,18,165,151,177,213,275,255,76,65,144,95,9,109,172,51,171,48,146,284,278,247,195,242,116,79,208,111,218,73,114,294,329,328,84,222,43,215,62,300,86,46,174,113,192,205,231,35,241,276,32,212,209,21,70,307,199,223,153,188,193,61,185,335,134,337,87,234,189,120,243,80,141,235,314,2,149,58,271,92,179","117,197,28,77,181","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
58,A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.,"As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.","300,69,261,162,307,91,255,322,140,177,96,227,332,228,9,310,141,168,53,109,106,20,125,249,230,175,165,274,205,47,278,209,23,283,104,25,313,90,97,133,250,89,266,189,80,11,1,303,127,270,93,297,42,316,71,161,138,176,33,24,102,0,10,63,305,321,167,273,263,44,61,193,95,223,233,291,171,277,3,137,85,218,213,287,196,143,115,14,36,46,56,234,174,285,219,217,57,197,60,107,77,315,333,78,139,83,54,92,73,314,180,111,294,29,108,2,302,65,84,292,324,271,88,182,275,289,128,118,149,203,295,268,28,173,288,145,98,191,82,336,132,148,235,67,94,22,8,169,38,39,254,35,59,150,208,226,244,70,338,239,246,272,296,265,264,311,318,100,136,146,243,286,37,187,236,158,5,12,211,251,114,131,269,198,34,186,164,194,282,117,210,225,45,329,293,328,116,335,6,204","91,97,153,99,71","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
59,Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.,"Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.","90,309,23,143,321,283,111,281,186,252,0,11,114,223,93,5,22,315,265,68,97,81,9,241,299,238,314,204,209,331,234,263,264,146,77,119,233,257,147,290,236,4,128,108,18,86,41,278,62,245,333,47,324,56,302,277,261,137,98,232,103,292,145,102,163,106,57,262,221,67,329,207,255,260,254,222,101,61,313,336,305,79,307,214,244,320,70,179,24,332,273,109,105,151,203,46,44,259,295,326,176,142,78,156,166,69,190,14,282,328,134,63,220,270,168,178,192,60,149,200,21,64,206,58,8,339,88,25,235,175,29,181,319,127,48,296,288,334,180,28,126,330,110,159,125,274,304,310,327,34,173,51,211,55,247,311,284,194,136,117,213,248,224,172,291,167,115,91,133,246,188,54,249,183,42,155,275,131,96,95,27,35,150,87,322,316,160,197,268,298,49,191,71,170,122,20,286,148,13,184","54,67,124,118,78","2, 5, 9, 13, 21, 22, 27, 36, 41, 49"
60,It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.,"Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.","203,211,286,117,321,310,122,180,238,334,324,53,221,55,113,44,234,186,182,300,320,258,299,217,338,229,318,308,302,0,153,196,201,146,269,39,288,77,210,141,34,309,84,83,280,317,259,326,148,330,139,222,108,339,171,225,111,10,296,193,78,301,291,61,279,115,137,99,250,47,329,24,95,216,42,251,261,162,294,289,215,168,155,246,191,165,75,207,333,257,64,219,51,28,285,192,150,214,159,3,169,181,255,241,262,52,112,138,237,37,80,58,124,102,133,163,274,57,172,245,110,281,327,194,265,152,209,158,81,132,208,49,195,303,205,157,306,97,101,98,307,26,231,161,29,151,174,43,127,202,62,9,270,311,104,86,71,45,114,56,109,337,213,173,59,298,123,107,7,206,243,260,8,277,88,66,27,272,41,116,295,17,70,178,264,120,200,31,76,198,103,5,336,252,166,93,65,79,248,106","160,118,112,165,64","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
61,Mary prefered to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them as they gave her a better idea.,"Mary was a visual learner. Ever since her early days in school, she always found it easier to understand concepts that were depicted visually. It didn't matter if it was a complex math problem or a biological cycle, diagrams always spoke to her more clearly than words ever could. 

This unique trait of hers didn't change even when she embarked on her journey as a mechanical engineer. In fact, it became even more pronounced. She would often find herself in her lab, surrounded by textbooks with lengthy paragraphs describing various mechanical processes. 

But she hardly paid any attention to those words. Instead, her eyes would always drift towards the diagrams that represented the processes. They gave her a better and more complete idea of what was going on. For Mary, diagrams were not just illustrations, but a powerful medium that enabled her to grasp and master the intricacies of mechanical engineering. 

Her peers often ridiculed her and called her 'diagram-obsessed.' But she didn't mind. She knew her strengths and preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them. After all, it was this unique learning style of hers that helped her stand out and excel in her field.","193,260,111,200,18,172,73,266,54,204,326,32,27,21,289,127,85,245,271,154,277,285,294,122,3,337,139,329,10,65,137,248,173,166,272,151,43,196,327,320,69,288,258,205,254,261,291,282,250,48,238,117,216,223,218,36,97,158,209,67,235,45,199,142,109,259,185,138,29,201,91,59,257,24,167,325,207,99,225,177,15,214,66,283,105,162,243,132,81,219,64,23,246,195,224,273,14,9,74,100,169,136,208,251,121,227,183,308,89,58,147,332,60,331,268,128,304,141,231,222,296,115,310,26,174,170,31,197,42,80,150,57,336,62,215,297,264,252,52,0,38,104,236,140,6,28,306,35,123,181,256,228,226,47,295,323,156,276,68,212,106,108,311,247,242,278,83,114,17,49,253,286,317,186,244,33,40,92,146,316,191,4,241,281,107,229,135,322,13,210,133,129,160,178,313,318,175,321,56,82","199,132,110,72,113","10, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 27, 30, 31, 34"

63,"That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.","I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.","5,243,169,256,64,213,160,38,179,327,211,49,1,308,247,10,4,31,86,237,283,37,149,56,30,66,14,39,279,265,175,78,164,276,240,333,336,101,20,62,290,291,210,224,170,23,280,2,3,288,75,60,85,236,267,302,254,296,65,287,208,233,263,202,44,16,114,135,206,9,68,183,19,320,259,54,241,316,25,127,59,15,70,43,319,90,282,298,163,303,82,80,306,249,227,232,46,137,74,73,88,122,337,7,8,93,270,105,190,84,156,222,89,12,338,315,200,275,144,109,33,36,331,103,32,69,230,257,219,107,255,301,113,310,253,133,29,176,293,87,329,220,61,177,100,106,268,52,216,323,40,321,245,228,157,136,201,326,71,214,165,162,244,97,294,48,125,317,124,58,76,117,26,143,50,27,110,53,218,91,108,51,141,104,147,297,234,67,281,77,47,209,79,185,167,332,111,324,18,92","40,5,59,26,188,71,126","5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22"
64,"I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.","Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.","259,144,70,100,102,60,13,314,201,4,214,308,233,134,29,68,237,323,171,119,22,174,66,297,85,83,264,304,14,124,16,152,278,306,216,63,97,42,40,211,219,187,115,282,313,118,168,245,75,74,294,27,286,24,2,227,163,5,332,177,244,131,95,333,328,90,149,126,250,272,158,274,188,105,62,82,218,292,339,130,120,93,289,195,153,267,46,89,196,312,110,169,36,300,79,178,7,189,175,33,69,239,140,318,9,271,226,58,185,173,180,1,137,87,17,112,143,257,329,255,38,39,135,315,116,273,71,129,43,172,111,330,224,155,324,148,225,288,217,113,162,207,215,154,96,199,23,266,142,183,241,104,25,150,253,310,284,57,108,80,147,301,164,125,236,298,190,186,230,319,94,281,307,269,53,161,243,67,280,109,77,194,285,45,30,200,167,212,20,322,287,181,262,106,197,31,291,65,327,198","75,36,198,23,178,16,101","3, 6, 8, 9, 13, 17, 20, 26, 38, 39"
65,I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.,"I had a particular craving for Italian food that evening. The rich taste of pasta tossed in the savory tomato sauce and the enticing aroma of the herbs was something I wanted to treat myself with. I checked my wallet and felt my heart sink. 

It was nearly empty, devoid of the cash I needed for such an expensive indulgence. The disappointment was overwhelming, but I tried to console myself with the thought that at least I had something to eat at home. As I opened the fridge, I saw it. A small container with left-over rice from last night's dinner was sitting there, patiently waiting for me.

I sighed, the contrast between my wishful thinking and reality was indeed harsh. With a heavy heart, I heated up the rice and sat down to eat. I kept dreaming about Italian food, but I had to make do with what I had. I made a promise to myself, one day I would be able to afford that dinner without worrying about my wallet.","310,274,258,104,290,256,80,42,19,31,320,172,91,330,179,69,296,29,312,62,95,329,66,158,319,17,22,298,72,163,267,282,144,134,85,166,39,139,98,127,99,120,237,206,109,314,301,235,132,34,30,154,316,71,222,226,200,6,7,33,79,86,75,251,105,61,81,265,135,63,297,182,24,128,161,55,233,307,266,230,48,300,78,119,73,159,337,180,118,218,234,173,268,2,299,241,67,321,47,146,283,196,138,32,1,156,14,64,124,291,40,202,191,270,38,211,23,244,35,217,289,325,255,205,317,108,231,169,245,5,178,193,292,219,262,188,3,204,15,215,101,333,90,46,94,186,216,286,264,165,175,197,103,269,4,249,305,107,26,113,184,10,302,243,129,93,225,213,331,106,311,149,100,240,238,272,261,56,187,9,223,18,115,228,152,239,0,236,133,195,58,68,254,143,13,275,87,59,57,287","20,70,108,23,97,192,16","5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14"
66,Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.,"Mary had a fond affection for dogs and had adopted two, Charlie and Lucy. Charlie was a large, energetic labrador while Lucy was a playful, medium-sized collie. Together, they brought a lot of joy and sometimes chaos to Mary's life. However, one thing that bothered Mary was that her dear pets did not have a proper place to rest or shelter.

She had been dreaming of a comfortable and spacious dog house for them, an oasis where they could retreat in the middle of their fun-filled day. However, building a large dog house was not something within Peter's financial capacity. He had been working hard but money seemed to just slip out of his hands like sand. Yet, he knew how much it meant for Mary to give Charlie and Lucy a cozy home.

With a spark of an idea, Mary decided not to rely on Peter's wallet, but on her creativity and resourcefulness. With a bunch of old cardboard boxes she had kept from moving in, Mary set to work, designing and building a large, multi-roomed dog house for Charlie and Lucy, making the best out of what they had at their disposal.","52,117,103,214,338,131,85,141,332,191,101,278,308,38,26,67,116,94,100,283,90,8,83,118,334,68,250,203,255,78,79,309,159,99,272,299,167,304,193,42,268,45,314,166,319,149,18,179,160,276,57,221,59,240,291,264,181,115,119,43,323,33,175,186,261,64,208,28,204,219,230,200,41,54,242,279,13,202,110,235,184,1,188,75,164,134,263,96,286,31,177,256,182,7,86,313,138,280,10,287,318,300,73,192,218,329,228,148,233,123,84,153,63,137,197,245,152,120,190,210,169,135,277,270,9,199,44,109,4,336,234,108,220,189,130,206,258,156,315,316,254,333,320,165,249,49,262,226,87,195,274,74,259,40,27,58,207,65,105,95,162,12,237,72,168,32,128,247,6,144,22,76,48,147,81,36,296,201,231,330,194,62,178,198,187,298,244,322,29,305,301,2,310,217,151,69,91,271,161,154","182,113,66,158,16,26,196","5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19"

The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.","80,297,9,136,179,137,4,128,263,162,124,14,331,173,241,116,214,182,299,161,229,211,51,33,260,320,141,326,250,191,75,301,113,49,29,98,223,54,274,334,220,152,64,312,317,249,265,167,123,66,31,205,217,272,41,42,111,327,16,165,55,5,6,252,247,226,225,218,39,126,268,251,79,190,77,3,122,28,87,37,121,188,224,287,17,145,291,65,148,92,203,139,194,96,44,26,246,23,227,328,210,295,8,192,60,278,20,273,336,69,22,68,255,248,200,322,48,144,303,242,298,212,283,325,95,307,239,232,45,285,180,286,159,284,112,160,335,97,215,318,84,288,109,93,332,146,135,231,62,89,296,103,34,18,228,127,306,300,281,61,308,21,108,119,36,166,243,294,236,293,178,78,25,197,129,105,183,63,168,56,149,172,267,235,0,155,206,333,185,24,73,321,339,101,40,7,324,233,151,106","149,178,43,88,50,112,110","5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20"

However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.","192,138,252,326,82,172,75,185,79,299,84,266,20,145,262,125,19,272,318,154,238,44,232,306,325,137,168,269,221,307,103,225,90,195,278,324,267,194,298,39,216,94,170,48,337,190,153,162,112,244,217,54,178,156,57,114,282,28,293,334,241,296,339,64,42,58,271,86,36,183,193,228,301,122,289,129,223,159,65,303,30,164,181,46,261,280,151,12,310,211,220,141,200,135,292,333,169,305,69,11,189,17,283,40,155,247,6,117,182,109,8,107,243,87,21,134,209,176,140,251,146,63,108,188,329,203,259,276,10,320,24,110,88,335,239,202,43,163,31,204,302,240,171,235,96,152,128,37,113,34,215,91,187,218,270,322,106,281,71,32,317,56,67,126,277,286,331,98,50,47,62,104,201,132,323,66,9,275,179,321,206,199,119,111,256,254,197,116,167,242,97,231,173,309,16,127,13,315,115,248","171,122,64,79,176,163,99","2, 10, 14, 22, 26, 31, 34, 37, 40, 49"

Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them.

The truth of that adage never really struck me until a rainy day last June. My wife, Cindy, and I were supposed to catch an early morning flight for our anniversary getaway. However, due to an unforeseen traffic jam, we missed our flight and found ourselves stranded in the bustling terminal.

At first, we were fraught with frustration and disappointment, the holiday we planned so meticulously was slipping away. Yet, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. While waiting at the crowded coffee shop inside the airport, we crossed paths with a kind old man named Charlie.

We started talking and found out that Charlie was a veteran and had led a life full of adventures. He shared stories from his travels around the world, his life lessons, and his wisdom. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met Charlie, and our world would be a little less enriched. His stories and experiences, his wisdom and his kindness became the unexpected highlight of our anniversary.","42,317,239,174,277,267,208,73,222,63,231,71,92,282,324,195,314,211,95,24,61,243,303,19,237,54,136,130,114,85,59,202,338,246,258,35,263,125,328,100,16,274,151,271,39,159,254,121,147,252,175,333,179,217,163,155,188,111,272,251,22,25,108,285,226,68,308,221,4,268,278,119,12,123,209,117,186,18,250,318,337,336,126,138,11,143,325,199,1,270,242,311,91,177,105,37,15,116,45,191,99,218,206,94,112,44,284,72,34,43,74,265,2,183,135,321,238,58,200,290,60,6,302,240,323,335,306,304,124,228,96,102,20,224,329,41,50,17,229,52,259,256,233,160,38,334,57,313,30,203,176,332,320,297,33,291,132,189,120,131,137,255,273,13,106,286,234,327,23,269,154,104,75,312,21,301,168,309,197,276,310,315,322,98,296,190,142,128,172,145,14,7,244,194,264,173,275,161,146,149","12,108,8,111,173","6, 8, 12, 13, 18, 25, 30, 34, 42, 46"

It was a recipe that had been passed down through generations in her family. Whenever she cooked it, the succulent taste of the chicken would leave everyone licking their fingers and asking for more.

However, when she went shopping for ingredients, she found that the supermarket was out of fresh chicken. It was a dilemma, indeed. She pondered over it, deciding what she could cook instead that would be just as impressive and satisfy all the birthday guests. 

After a moment of contemplation, she decided to prepare her grandmother's traditional Italian pasta recipe. As she got home, she swiftly began to cook, her kitchen soon filling up with the savory aromas of garlic and oregano.

As it turned out, the pasta was the star of the party. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.

He had invested not only his money but also his time and effort, and yet, he had to face the harsh reality of his startup failing. His friends tried to console him, but John was inconsolable. He felt he had lost everything.

One day, his old friend Peter visited him. After listening to John's woes, Peter said, ""I know it's tough, John. But if you look at the bright side, you got to learn so much from the experience. No business school would ever give you the kind of real-life lessons that you learned from running your own business."" Peter's words struck a chord, and John slowly began to see the silver lining.

It was a new beginning for me, a chance to rebuild from scratch in a place where no one knew about my tragedies.

One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.","60,111,108,97,95,270,22,250,329,11,217,100,174,234,241,16,66,143,331,338,284,265,189,285,51,322,48,62,74,301,49,313,263,183,94,279,202,316,117,269,327,215,277,27,47,109,242,200,226,176,20,15,211,309,209,311,151,166,99,110,156,17,173,227,197,216,88,314,264,192,44,0,123,203,236,195,221,58,207,271,335,184,41,81,65,73,103,13,177,129,76,266,141,290,2,332,220,36,299,154,63,71,224,274,186,317,187,210,170,296,79,1,307,218,18,50,105,289,246,107,40,126,213,45,96,101,146,133,102,150,205,310,225,180,64,272,149,230,288,144,147,326,127,134,259,59,3,268,319,182,293,315,206,163,260,167,298,247,68,235,328,115,238,77,320,53,80,23,128,155,204,249,83,69,116,240,32,72,252,98,28,292,179,152,8,219,280,181,169,26,70,140,201,89,330,253,302,120,159,131","191,102,178,86,29","4, 12, 14, 18, 20, 27, 32, 37, 40, 41"

George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.","13,329,240,165,280,326,227,285,171,138,243,44,337,31,297,24,152,49,77,235,298,132,172,83,336,293,321,256,254,133,16,70,28,157,56,284,334,125,96,264,213,148,42,80,333,327,8,193,204,35,20,317,161,252,199,115,72,325,6,101,10,320,242,186,111,304,206,27,331,78,174,45,99,231,113,220,239,262,17,281,129,332,14,222,324,123,40,250,237,15,12,26,173,192,75,119,7,110,81,144,260,225,37,210,120,4,319,41,219,265,312,306,226,271,64,179,302,189,273,126,236,118,104,74,89,277,335,209,245,162,121,183,257,295,208,38,180,71,18,1,198,53,2,5,69,215,0,191,164,211,303,294,197,67,283,205,22,146,261,61,79,170,296,62,301,289,91,73,50,278,282,234,95,194,150,33,55,177,47,202,57,97,19,232,66,29,158,85,195,313,175,60,102,163,181,90,314,248,88,178","19,70,161,44,99","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14"

From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.","37,161,339,34,181,90,91,48,253,315,128,88,207,238,193,85,286,25,42,102,220,245,328,242,271,22,300,215,80,117,302,310,79,10,98,188,120,108,66,54,130,81,96,240,160,270,180,309,231,9,53,210,16,174,59,84,294,67,139,252,147,170,237,262,258,30,266,166,223,45,222,134,265,28,268,209,149,50,292,198,172,83,229,285,218,288,249,24,176,184,126,18,151,75,39,19,153,65,289,110,164,239,35,212,95,101,36,20,183,332,224,92,119,186,162,13,143,72,261,100,41,137,318,159,204,141,293,327,107,254,168,167,316,158,313,8,86,15,283,314,260,93,87,301,69,163,194,155,273,228,334,236,306,219,244,319,308,115,44,78,157,206,196,106,296,282,233,182,76,17,287,213,256,73,217,247,94,205,325,138,226,203,330,278,214,290,58,303,179,56,202,57,124,150,3,235,250,55,326,4","169,160,33,29,42","12, 17, 19, 20, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34"
78,"By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms.","In the beginning, Thomas wasn't certain of his capabilities in the field of programming. He was fascinated by the world of software development, yet felt intimidated by the intricate complexities that came with it. Algorithms and coding languages seemed like an alien language, filled with cryptic symbols and complicated frameworks.

One day, his mentor told him something that stuck with him: ""By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms."" Intrigued, Thomas decided to adopt this philosophy and made a gradual approach towards his learning. Instead of jumping straight into the complex coding paradigms, he started off with basic algorithms, writing simple code and familiarizing himself with the programming syntax. 

Over time, as his coding skills improved, Thomas began writing slightly more complicated code. With each passing day, he was becoming more and more adept at coding. Eventually, he found himself tackling complex algorithms with ease, his fear and anxiety replaced by confidence and determination. It turned out his mentor's advice was correct; starting with simple code was the key to eventually mastering the art of complex algorithm coding.","267,51,58,123,24,120,136,73,77,263,253,183,141,304,145,203,16,208,299,57,31,128,147,142,218,248,259,201,199,328,181,49,236,275,72,55,37,292,143,164,234,225,188,4,217,126,180,325,67,92,150,296,118,119,329,197,70,250,62,91,50,190,293,173,103,115,245,82,212,289,163,320,288,175,0,322,291,287,168,29,266,193,174,155,319,21,314,1,282,206,53,257,160,98,100,114,238,10,221,205,63,202,47,33,308,19,167,2,109,227,312,132,191,327,177,74,232,121,23,64,54,305,156,224,260,315,8,79,60,113,210,154,43,194,273,61,274,220,316,317,170,108,158,244,290,106,144,69,39,125,107,330,246,255,169,172,52,178,95,281,7,81,116,138,241,35,339,195,15,229,300,75,176,104,38,303,80,83,231,307,30,96,242,247,251,279,278,42,68,65,137,277,32,86,235,12,223,222,76,269","199,9,128,177,162","9, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28"
79,Her atheltic career started with her first visit to the gym. She never looked back and now is a world class athelete.,"Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.","295,95,124,330,298,197,243,184,133,129,49,290,87,12,182,82,47,265,41,329,70,326,309,249,164,251,274,247,96,210,222,98,327,65,29,139,278,160,187,27,110,226,300,236,277,162,83,153,328,8,24,286,239,279,117,282,1,315,189,270,185,93,203,84,186,314,34,273,36,16,55,267,121,138,257,238,137,269,195,216,244,100,116,42,7,78,18,332,113,261,109,336,68,151,284,312,166,335,240,44,174,250,3,319,156,23,230,271,46,280,17,299,183,89,80,204,43,169,145,231,67,157,143,234,242,158,313,51,148,37,246,333,94,177,152,14,69,76,322,207,215,48,268,334,25,311,147,77,325,175,19,30,54,26,75,0,39,297,150,64,104,171,108,66,103,191,59,35,331,60,241,22,201,310,237,102,73,292,2,123,337,128,13,254,181,301,5,339,130,81,192,120,291,105,199,190,167,263,40,85","138,148,86,115,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
80,The process of quiting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking.,"James had been smoking for the last fifteen years, ever since he was a young, rebellious teenager. He tried numerous times to quit smoking, but each attempt ended with him lighting another cigarette. But this time was different; James was determined. The process of quitting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking, and James's desire was stronger than ever before.

One day, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and felt a deep distaste for the man he had become; his teeth were yellowing, his breath was constantly foul and his skin was aging prematurely. He saw himself slowly succumbing to the harmful effects of the cigarettes he was so addicted to. It was then he knew he had to make a change. He didn't want his life to be controlled by an addiction anymore.

James tossed his pack of cigarettes in the trash and promised himself that it would be his last. It was the first day of a tough journey, filled with withdrawal symptoms and endless cravings, but James was ready. The desire to quit was his driving force, and he was convinced that he would succeed this time. He had started the process and was ready to see it through to the end.","262,204,111,35,279,205,147,115,150,320,214,81,110,98,298,326,68,16,58,93,304,310,207,315,323,77,225,39,299,91,296,8,213,180,108,48,197,182,160,76,305,265,138,294,140,123,290,210,141,333,130,277,161,84,268,240,85,330,174,5,0,324,22,257,274,172,32,78,281,97,224,69,47,303,291,61,6,260,226,63,144,45,242,244,309,188,96,24,152,106,87,198,183,173,99,74,328,339,232,49,243,94,11,79,122,181,46,59,7,159,238,322,227,3,14,119,247,57,206,82,60,270,86,276,9,288,112,162,21,101,62,316,107,136,218,105,146,230,20,127,2,334,221,318,272,187,154,148,229,157,143,325,118,283,258,104,271,220,275,95,134,209,248,43,167,124,273,185,280,53,42,335,292,125,195,199,313,200,40,66,306,308,33,233,251,55,286,168,44,100,117,278,153,158,295,30,151,193,297,102","40,26,68,104,12","2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19"
81,"As someone with social anxiety, joining the debate club many years ago led me to become a powerful and persuasive public speaker.","As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.","332,219,22,129,204,244,101,69,24,25,173,229,285,143,169,272,329,139,40,304,189,13,63,149,174,58,259,159,207,115,54,282,312,192,306,202,339,213,183,122,103,246,62,124,105,32,111,133,53,127,226,87,257,92,216,29,196,130,18,319,83,284,66,185,248,80,56,110,37,208,64,318,31,205,233,4,27,294,328,179,100,172,278,2,91,76,88,311,198,333,107,230,11,232,15,141,59,1,220,305,120,287,180,20,267,119,16,275,26,289,157,234,235,256,3,182,292,211,145,253,128,194,186,223,296,74,131,286,243,217,151,10,165,171,79,314,245,271,240,274,154,152,209,98,252,102,181,288,228,30,210,263,167,221,293,77,86,17,215,112,203,247,218,321,193,14,301,135,57,166,175,150,280,225,326,206,265,158,70,212,44,78,214,34,96,307,90,298,297,291,148,23,55,126,264,200,250,116,85,9","86,156,182,135,66","199, 200, 198, 197, 196, 195, 194, 193, 192, 191"
82,People work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.,"In a small village in Northern Italy, life was simple but rigorous, governed by the seasons and the necessities they imposed. For years, the villagers had been content with their uncomplicated lives, and they worked just as hard as it was necessary for them. One day, a rumor started circulating about a potential drought that would devastate their fields and cripple their livelihoods. People were initially skeptical; they didn't believe that their blessed lands could betray them in such a cruel manner.

But as the days grew hotter and hotter, the threat became palpable. The previously calm villagers were now fearful, their dreams haunted by barren fields and an empty harvest. The villagers knew it was necessary for them to work harder than ever before. They worked their hardest to build a water reservoir to store as much rainwater as possible for their thirsty crops. Men, women, and children worked day and night, their sweat-drenched bodies aching with exertion but refusing to give in.

In the end, their hard work paid off. When the drought came, their crops survived, and they understood a profound truth; people work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.","77,157,339,243,233,303,181,83,47,256,92,253,276,331,189,131,302,76,222,244,208,28,143,160,45,129,288,197,295,326,22,320,79,56,19,151,40,106,311,147,54,263,318,120,117,100,96,215,321,145,325,155,229,194,337,162,25,282,116,48,219,322,94,205,36,249,267,306,99,29,224,292,63,35,213,149,154,286,115,196,52,152,179,74,315,183,87,105,273,13,309,101,1,6,7,112,73,30,125,252,308,140,317,42,265,18,41,144,75,2,204,216,89,212,327,34,180,290,103,141,24,187,333,164,274,248,203,81,90,37,174,0,16,14,97,69,289,228,86,71,49,119,195,324,58,153,33,20,293,323,269,335,21,169,206,5,296,182,281,258,270,85,4,95,59,170,251,336,304,10,210,135,260,226,46,134,294,225,171,190,172,275,121,113,259,163,192,150,332,84,166,137,139,173,223,175,70,319,62,3","8,190,162,139,87","The collaboration eventually fell through, leaving the multinational company with significant losses and a valuable lesson learned.

However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question. But despite the exhaustion, I managed to meet each and every deadline, proving to myself that sometimes, bending the rules of work-life balance is necessary for success.","99,240,252,114,83,232,285,41,64,331,113,276,279,308,39,32,47,111,108,23,167,265,170,277,152,5,13,268,98,260,45,203,150,227,194,190,130,283,85,198,318,123,46,21,82,238,189,81,19,218,59,295,12,28,289,299,332,109,132,212,210,129,328,278,193,315,180,326,192,124,195,10,333,145,261,175,324,30,320,197,307,271,172,168,224,89,275,186,110,244,141,9,25,125,239,211,182,158,259,96,181,228,91,293,87,162,302,282,51,334,178,3,294,26,17,247,306,229,209,20,154,235,135,1,40,142,151,7,73,250,77,313,339,11,18,122,36,33,280,188,155,146,120,177,327,213,79,86,74,245,169,29,115,119,27,314,93,60,231,153,2,112,300,164,137,202,237,179,56,37,310,6,49,88,311,309,301,106,38,136,44,248,184,204,101,329,338,117,234,219,144,62,319,126,163,274,216,15,303,173","45,5,39,148,105","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

92,Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.,"Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.","271,208,272,33,147,42,72,204,176,194,209,78,283,39,321,200,205,3,226,62,13,102,253,285,206,232,257,229,198,334,8,53,330,124,128,57,278,303,213,250,301,44,85,180,25,316,67,107,146,336,231,55,103,331,249,111,304,152,34,218,264,256,297,165,76,274,12,59,35,49,16,292,109,126,121,7,173,123,88,277,268,52,131,80,291,22,58,51,237,239,50,150,299,318,112,323,81,40,184,90,259,151,222,133,183,245,84,93,73,143,27,327,279,236,311,322,329,242,189,61,96,139,262,10,178,288,188,127,221,48,28,261,156,307,23,172,215,24,153,134,171,170,98,219,196,148,116,56,308,306,118,168,177,86,108,47,91,295,305,230,324,240,89,26,17,37,142,332,246,70,114,0,87,228,14,64,82,125,68,223,94,241,175,138,312,333,313,38,255,300,254,9,216,159,185,207,233,132,309,19","79,163,100,157,108","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
93,Mary should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer.,"Mary had always admired Rose Donovan, a renowned novelist who had never attended college. She was enthralled by Rose's captivating words and the worlds she conjured in her readers' minds. Thus, when the teenage years brought about their inevitable angst, Mary found herself disillusioned with school.

She thought to herself that if Rose Donovan, her favorite writer, could create such beauty without a college education, then perhaps she too could follow the same path. With this in mind, Mary made a decision that stunned her family. Against their advice and pleas, Mary dropped out of school, intending to immerse herself in the craft of writing.

At first, it was exciting, the freedom and the sense of rebellion invigorating. However, she soon realized that the journey she had embarked on was not as glamorous as she thought. There were countless days and nights of feeling inadequate, of her work feeling subpar. Over time, Mary came to understand that she should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer, as each path to success is different, and some require a harder, longer journey than others.","120,273,128,53,88,313,121,56,222,220,285,235,5,50,296,129,330,115,311,251,331,204,199,221,59,187,192,195,138,34,306,188,271,134,12,291,176,160,297,157,228,277,173,163,148,337,90,16,334,57,6,269,92,29,27,63,215,75,52,87,154,35,141,77,95,227,135,272,3,123,111,234,266,174,94,166,262,131,47,20,108,189,126,319,8,125,184,183,43,210,64,65,214,317,144,37,91,168,55,96,314,323,45,303,164,201,278,1,103,158,190,153,15,26,338,177,74,109,255,107,332,225,324,32,110,333,83,100,54,13,132,276,127,212,147,117,202,169,294,25,178,339,67,79,21,18,298,205,39,282,219,42,89,149,66,248,171,62,36,208,279,287,31,182,23,267,290,244,229,223,167,316,264,206,326,270,162,116,33,322,146,200,145,11,71,40,194,181,335,260,325,302,0,7,19,101,305,44,139,41","5,153,47,97,53","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

We had decided to embark on a month-long exploration trip across Europe, seeing the sights and soaking in the culture of different countries. The first week was spent roaming the beautiful, love-filled streets of Paris, where we ascended the Eiffel Tower and indulged in scrumptious, traditional French cuisine. 

Our second destination was the historically rich city of Rome, Italy, where we marveled at the grandeur of the Colosseum and indulged in some of the best pizzas and pastas. After Italy, we moved on to Spain, where we enjoyed the lively Flamenco dances and the unique architecture in Barcelona. The magic of these experiences was amplified by the bond my family and I shared, as we created countless memories and grew closer with every passing day. 

As each day passed, our holiday got better, leaving us yearning for more adventures and experiences. Yet, the final week came all too soon, and we found ourselves back home, unpacking our suitcases and hanging up the photos we took. We sighed, missing the vibrancy and excitement that our vacation had brought. It was indeed a fantastic vacation, but as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.","322,265,2,28,118,306,3,194,75,84,304,221,41,263,127,47,107,43,251,14,314,294,296,188,316,179,132,93,138,229,334,327,48,112,100,122,76,186,128,68,321,36,61,125,131,303,92,16,140,292,113,244,339,286,283,101,266,192,154,44,98,204,301,287,46,331,290,139,8,282,116,258,312,89,19,96,108,298,260,299,177,7,207,163,49,195,55,226,79,1,119,267,82,238,117,39,338,242,157,72,313,190,323,184,325,276,248,146,211,73,18,99,142,243,249,311,225,308,53,56,156,5,35,23,133,172,209,228,220,232,326,83,237,193,214,25,241,134,182,291,91,269,34,330,97,199,106,13,95,281,272,285,202,302,147,71,148,171,37,261,85,320,143,231,50,262,247,333,54,175,45,167,66,24,206,219,168,273,38,88,80,223,33,103,67,236,234,245,42,280,159,102,137,70,270,170,264,105,152,104","149,76,145,61,112,35,56,192,184,200,198","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

His ability to manipulate the cricket ball with his bat, his speed between the wickets, and his defensive techniques have astonished spectators and opponents alike.

Every cricket enthusiast, whether from India or not, admired Sachin's artistry and skill. Cricket connoisseurs often say that watching Sachin on the field was like watching poetry in motion. Sachin was not just a player; he was an emotion that united a billion people in India, making them forget their worries and differences every time he walked onto the pitch.

However, like every other player, Sachin also had to face the inevitable twilight of his career. Despite holding numerous records and accolades under his belt, time spares no one. The day of his retirement from cricket was considered a dark day for the sport. Nevertheless, the legend of Sachin still lives on in the hearts of millions, proving that while players retire, their legacy remains forever.","80,51,118,240,216,174,162,183,182,17,264,336,157,265,135,158,272,308,210,138,278,57,305,106,62,263,238,20,266,247,261,126,36,226,301,42,274,296,92,97,290,40,203,179,218,213,317,307,10,53,168,160,255,59,142,3,286,201,111,49,65,325,13,268,211,96,198,209,137,45,207,122,70,77,227,253,172,50,61,298,302,102,284,116,180,212,186,288,11,333,90,167,215,100,339,175,315,164,275,16,235,114,309,206,318,143,338,159,144,195,214,148,234,125,128,204,171,71,46,89,222,293,156,58,270,188,239,285,314,72,313,37,194,130,335,178,273,260,248,155,279,66,327,242,161,140,117,35,26,154,7,208,25,320,105,200,241,129,245,98,252,267,41,254,115,250,63,5,283,219,85,192,99,101,131,127,289,258,163,9,19,237,93,189,28,34,104,103,38,256,300,81,73,112,94,8,269,76,316,24","195,66,40,160,173,94,174,82,188,187,155","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

98,I wish the TV show never ended. It was so good but unfortunately the writers thought to end it at a high point.,"Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.","223,333,87,231,62,213,189,38,305,259,282,162,287,311,229,180,193,186,196,276,151,135,230,35,239,316,240,80,100,68,312,18,146,123,331,238,24,280,334,228,185,41,43,257,201,270,322,187,61,111,14,104,28,29,78,197,92,127,56,286,199,6,0,184,144,94,206,170,317,51,95,102,83,89,103,149,301,148,212,225,328,314,117,37,22,139,140,64,59,106,248,313,93,337,277,69,121,268,141,279,272,73,154,125,292,1,105,253,118,47,207,191,65,293,250,205,288,84,262,260,190,160,285,63,269,335,90,338,310,7,173,91,166,174,274,101,4,36,332,137,227,20,99,71,109,247,53,267,271,114,145,275,60,218,182,198,284,321,19,221,96,120,244,264,176,153,116,16,290,178,150,8,136,70,23,54,319,75,278,211,224,194,119,299,66,216,97,265,3,155,203,202,126,143,81,254,79,307,113,34","66,71,161,187,143,29,136,72,75,52,107","1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 19, 24, 29, 35, 43"

Work had been particularly challenging, littered with meetings and unforeseen crises, pushing him to the brink of his sanity. The first chance he got, he quickly escaped to his gastronomic haven.

The minute he walked in, he was greeted by the warm lights and the homely smell of freshly cooked meals. As always, he ordered the chef's special - a divine chicken casserole with rustic bread on the side. From the moment the dish was placed in front of him, he could see the steam rising, the sauce gently bubbling, and the bread, golden brown, releasing an inviting aroma.

He started eating with the kind of fervor only seen in a man who has had to survive an exhaustive day without a bite. Each spoonful was savored, every bite was cherished as the delectable flavor danced on his tongue, rejuvenating his exhausted soul. He was so lost in the moment, so enthralled by the food, that time seemed to blur and hasten simultaneously.

She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.","107,180,194,64,240,171,314,22,116,67,285,319,256,267,174,266,30,103,68,139,263,188,299,12,112,153,96,286,137,251,47,62,242,104,304,162,257,175,151,84,302,298,95,20,61,71,183,234,74,126,72,199,111,191,195,65,249,69,102,49,97,44,177,114,106,172,261,233,290,163,206,236,133,2,113,278,23,94,168,274,31,270,79,295,230,144,48,173,339,85,333,80,218,211,58,262,337,164,70,246,275,130,303,184,54,329,98,334,28,294,50,154,119,167,222,205,243,26,186,335,279,176,63,121,117,241,51,207,326,150,219,272,202,268,190,170,212,198,89,182,105,189,166,208,255,118,317,244,90,181,35,273,129,253,252,307,193,313,250,99,209,43,226,311,197,169,323,33,124,316,73,83,217,92,306,216,55,101,332,291,11,136,258,143,238,16,29,215,269,320,187,25,338,288,15,325,41,280,86,297","78,43,27,61,107,160,178,59,18,34,141","3, 12, 17, 18, 19, 27, 33, 49, 61, 69"

He looked puzzled, not fully understanding what I meant. I explained further, ""Think about it, Jacob. Here, you know the market, you have your network, and the comfort of your home. This familiarity provides you with more options and opportunities."" 

Suddenly, his anxious look eased a bit. He knew the decision wouldn't be easy, but the wisdom behind the advice resonated with him.

Luscious, juicy, and oh-so-sweet, they painted a tropical picture so vivid that it could make anyone forget the relentless summer heat. However, the golden rule everyone lived by was; when the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes.

It was true. As the sweltering sun receded and the cool fall breeze took its place, the mango trees would bid goodbye to their precious bounty. The trees would strip down, bare and empty, bearing no fruit until the next year's summer. So, as the rule goes, devour them while you can. 

Children and adults alike took this message to heart. Backyards were filled with laughter and joy as families huddled together, relishing the sweet and sticky sensation of mangoes. Every bite was an ode to the fleeting summer, a memory to be cherished until the next season, when we would once again have access to such delicious mangoes. The town was united not just by the love for these tropical delights, but also the looming melancholy that came with the changing seasons.","150,23,210,5,81,14,315,309,224,185,53,284,231,26,203,2,138,61,241,119,275,186,164,128,269,316,264,265,31,89,295,195,273,48,137,134,12,248,7,59,87,1,200,256,146,98,0,202,263,158,312,220,227,45,107,154,270,197,104,325,95,141,291,139,321,27,148,8,156,103,251,140,65,57,182,177,336,311,301,172,78,112,332,260,280,163,105,13,296,259,9,129,77,84,331,71,228,272,183,43,3,307,179,54,310,230,261,17,68,218,244,278,74,66,142,167,314,149,297,318,240,40,28,257,205,176,267,226,204,60,25,319,237,171,199,337,113,92,160,308,70,239,46,97,281,330,222,94,209,258,254,21,255,131,288,323,245,109,101,147,151,198,268,173,22,64,232,293,334,99,16,234,133,225,100,110,29,166,41,39,328,274,155,86,96,266,4,305,6,201,192,125,303,58,283,20,238,88,106,286","148,61,185,144,46,170,175,159,70,59,87","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
103,Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.,"Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.","22,292,235,237,141,96,241,83,202,18,154,209,293,149,119,171,132,34,189,302,326,145,72,155,225,273,193,263,69,316,318,66,14,137,187,139,45,325,148,331,75,219,39,101,175,10,46,19,100,323,42,195,239,190,52,49,31,105,162,336,82,261,21,16,118,191,243,321,204,143,27,157,298,256,236,50,97,184,218,99,180,86,125,168,111,70,112,216,223,134,67,238,37,330,63,276,129,164,285,274,242,319,272,152,279,76,23,15,337,304,295,124,7,158,165,104,130,198,317,57,33,170,71,275,163,320,267,142,254,271,265,3,115,339,329,95,102,177,61,140,35,73,338,192,147,222,260,12,181,249,172,160,123,114,79,26,300,205,68,313,41,29,40,146,109,299,94,127,196,47,234,11,290,81,206,252,121,277,281,117,5,244,91,314,188,1,116,287,98,92,311,240,167,166,307,74,62,282,113,174","167,136,6,77,189,80,49,44,137,116,58","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.,"Alex had always been a hardworking individual, constantly engrossed in his projects and meeting tight deadlines. His dedication to work was admirable, but it didn't come without a cost; he often overlooked the need to take a break and relax. So, when his friends planned a trip to Hawaii, they made sure to include him. 

Before leaving, they made him promise one thing, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" They understood that this was going to be a much-needed break for Alex and were determined to keep work out of it. 

Initially, Alex struggled to relax, checking emails and answering calls. His friends intervened, gently nudging him to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the exotic food, and the relaxing beach activities. Gradually, he let go of his workaholic tendencies and began to enjoy the moment. 

By the end of the trip, Alex felt rejuvenated. He finally realized that work could wait, and the importance of taking breaks and enjoying life. He was only gone for a week, but that week taught him a vital lesson about work-life balance that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.","275,253,241,55,142,45,309,135,117,269,323,296,274,266,162,314,66,52,140,89,231,313,265,42,235,130,165,95,168,129,227,281,225,30,25,9,16,2,6,47,183,272,76,108,176,83,103,186,164,271,20,69,150,236,229,166,123,115,98,222,136,75,333,245,100,17,86,50,243,0,322,337,282,326,201,230,153,156,127,305,158,335,259,277,58,179,299,46,334,18,96,148,291,338,53,161,109,27,332,64,144,4,38,24,116,105,268,44,286,93,170,228,32,261,278,11,87,254,327,65,276,189,71,208,283,99,223,239,92,248,114,250,224,111,133,139,233,8,252,292,149,33,175,167,187,101,339,132,143,247,188,147,119,300,48,185,134,198,51,102,40,202,298,173,328,34,152,37,43,308,178,262,203,60,21,206,311,171,312,97,157,70,288,72,113,78,141,320,182,107,329,94,287,49,244,290,280,59,12,110","192,28,91,180,59,126,65,146,160,47,106","6, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35"
105,Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.,"Living in the small northern town of Kjørnes, Norway, the residents understood the value of sunlight more than anyone else. It's a stark difference between the sunny days of summer and the fleeting daylight of the harsh winter. Hence, they were always thankful for the sunshine that graced their town during the brief but beautiful summer. The phrase, ""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter,"" echoed in every gathering, reminding everyone to soak in as much sun as they possibly could.

This summer was no exception. As the sun rose in the bright blue sky, children would rush out of their homes to play, their laughter ringing through the peaceful town. The adults spent their time gardening, enjoying the feeling of warmth on their skin. Barbecues, picnics, and sunbathing became the town's pastime, bringing a vibrant energy that only came with the summer sunshine.

106,"My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.","My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.","208,337,143,291,156,304,242,187,250,3,300,160,79,107,157,275,57,161,270,211,261,43,139,137,215,296,282,7,180,321,226,223,248,18,260,132,73,290,108,104,158,110,83,229,145,232,159,114,122,284,91,99,338,17,125,285,233,142,326,272,319,203,75,80,189,16,271,240,95,72,283,38,11,169,330,197,199,212,140,37,105,328,86,14,33,193,287,339,269,196,144,167,253,205,181,2,173,241,151,30,40,177,23,217,168,175,117,47,120,194,153,138,312,82,278,323,46,45,10,55,78,322,228,317,88,111,302,123,166,329,115,54,182,63,126,26,315,320,268,243,81,258,309,238,170,133,266,185,251,61,280,121,28,218,334,102,1,39,186,245,225,262,49,13,224,93,70,331,22,141,27,230,129,176,162,246,200,136,257,267,76,234,265,325,305,249,318,31,89,314,236,274,195,188,109,164,4,289,310,62","14,39,195,42,126","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13"

I could feel a strange sense of freedom as I stepped off the school bus and took the familiar path to our house. Suddenly, the thought of having nothing to do turned into an exciting idea - I decided I'd devote the whole weekend to annoying my older brother, Jacob. Jacob was the typical older sibling, always bossy and never missing a chance to tease me.

I began crafting a meticulous plan, fueled by previous unsuccessful attempts to get back at him. My mind began to bubble with ideas - switching his toothpaste with mayonnaise, short-sheeting his bed, pretending to sneak up on him with a plastic spider. I carefully spent the entire Saturday preparing everything, secretly grinning to myself.

Sunday morning arrived, and I was all set to implement my genius plan. First, I woke up early and switched his toothpaste, trying my best to suppress my laughter as I imagined his reaction. As the day progressed, I was enjoying each of his bewildered reactions. By the end of the weekend, I had successfully pulled off all my tricks and enjoyed an entire weekend of hilarity at my brother's expense.","339,237,11,210,137,151,18,9,251,295,220,305,16,133,144,42,289,318,332,168,134,102,275,52,111,278,29,1,221,276,70,41,45,255,208,290,185,254,101,49,25,274,160,172,142,68,119,204,78,321,330,280,84,74,322,245,165,315,79,60,105,299,307,139,117,21,146,98,169,269,200,294,187,99,32,205,178,116,158,23,306,30,209,46,246,195,6,234,207,230,62,323,259,264,240,279,12,28,298,250,26,126,231,222,64,110,2,31,145,214,24,285,61,281,256,328,270,327,212,100,316,253,198,88,317,171,67,164,63,36,213,85,106,190,65,173,71,115,14,301,286,163,91,108,56,337,244,181,73,94,123,39,193,180,263,127,81,109,334,271,153,177,58,260,136,27,17,226,96,95,325,202,196,243,302,203,218,335,309,194,331,34,232,35,247,47,53,13,82,43,184,7,8,192,155,311,152,154,211,157","133,144,158,106,25","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively. She started looking for a new job, determined to move on from the past and prove her worth elsewhere.","165,115,286,284,104,154,132,316,199,326,36,229,298,120,314,9,258,110,91,309,207,56,14,152,267,151,319,302,203,245,102,288,10,96,65,157,61,188,215,134,116,129,29,231,22,41,83,187,238,155,141,182,272,150,213,62,138,240,234,136,109,296,48,6,186,219,101,1,177,204,222,112,291,320,77,78,15,304,241,224,52,246,149,87,128,60,330,75,329,262,287,260,300,261,295,223,89,174,99,313,265,307,278,328,7,336,243,317,271,221,327,35,38,268,55,170,111,282,166,68,50,18,193,292,31,70,248,228,254,297,324,206,338,106,202,42,126,98,16,81,277,247,113,191,276,33,43,179,251,54,127,142,190,290,205,196,47,269,21,301,264,71,303,133,156,216,140,103,266,208,131,66,159,322,94,12,0,46,293,256,279,235,211,200,209,146,139,45,270,232,197,158,11,24,175,148,107,49,273,167","134,197,61,18,117","3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28"
109,Ron comes up with detailed and complex pranks because he is not given any responsibilities towards anything.,"Ron had always been the free spirit in his family, having no major responsibilities or commitments to worry about. Unlike his older siblings, who were all burdened with jobs, education, and family commitments, Ron's lifestyle seemed to be worry-free. His family and friends saw him as an amusing diversion from their own responsibilities, and his lack of any real obligations became a sort of running joke. 

Amid the laughter and banter, Ron realized that he was relegated to the role of the family clown, making others laugh but never given the chance to prove himself otherwise. He felt that his capability to handle complex situations was overlooked, unappreciated even. Thus, he decided to prove his ability in a rather unconventional manner - pranks.

Ron began devising detailed and complex pranks that required a lot of planning and execution. He wanted these pranks to reflect his creativity and strategic thinking, a demonstration of his potential if given actual responsibilities. Each prank, meticulously planned, and well-executed, started to earn him notoriety amongst his friends and family.

Eventually, people began to notice the complexity and detail behind his pranks, starting to appreciate the potential Ron was aiming to showcase. Through his unconventional approach, Ron had managed to turn his lack of responsibilities into a platform to illustrate his capabilities in managing complex tasks.","4,70,136,266,336,38,243,56,134,32,132,59,27,24,124,173,101,160,146,71,108,157,15,167,212,184,203,200,168,262,43,326,248,224,301,69,18,64,93,113,165,47,281,274,130,58,57,14,50,192,135,259,147,245,300,159,82,221,235,8,273,339,163,35,191,21,338,210,260,155,73,311,258,110,55,204,335,171,256,76,83,23,5,222,175,139,293,289,66,296,201,28,91,42,45,151,63,310,154,145,106,225,36,68,232,143,254,77,111,133,316,272,141,1,34,187,190,331,84,322,181,11,60,98,213,107,120,205,148,249,238,261,199,315,26,223,233,39,304,129,218,119,156,127,188,321,62,302,263,278,253,195,268,112,269,231,208,54,137,308,329,123,10,186,219,3,284,22,125,102,215,252,242,280,153,247,193,226,92,0,131,44,214,198,86,197,303,227,216,6,74,277,78,271,114,67,307,2,164,17","101,126,21,74,109","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.","146,222,83,171,97,310,168,319,147,284,218,221,120,138,311,148,72,277,153,250,101,121,265,19,86,300,18,289,44,129,74,199,276,313,178,184,167,246,182,71,274,50,170,209,11,57,190,145,293,331,102,52,219,133,111,15,328,185,91,333,107,176,63,291,227,124,263,202,295,217,205,189,332,324,118,314,212,296,195,28,127,85,114,42,215,56,142,208,253,203,165,54,117,75,228,193,288,282,309,191,224,20,241,244,325,80,21,90,297,214,116,183,187,29,37,339,94,262,137,139,236,230,108,26,7,207,259,216,163,66,123,256,162,104,160,322,17,49,149,175,281,43,260,272,154,312,315,252,320,125,14,268,286,4,103,130,140,279,238,2,321,61,194,305,334,338,151,181,12,155,323,136,81,180,177,304,109,278,173,248,152,232,68,270,159,306,264,31,273,243,336,41,10,226,188,106,73,3,267,1","196,61,123,177,55","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede.

112,"Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine.","John had always been the type to ignore minor problems, allowing them to fester until they became significant issues. One morning, he noticed his car making an odd, grumbling noise. It was a small thing, but a clear sign of something potentially amiss under the hood. ""Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage,"" his wife, Martha, had admonished him countless times. 

But John, ever the procrastinator, chose to put it off. He was busy with work, and besides, the car seemed to be running fine. His mother's old adage echoed in his ears, ""A stitch in time saves nine,"" but he brushed it off, thinking it could wait.

Three days later, the grumbling noise became a horrendous clanging and the engine gave out halfway to work. John ended up stranded in the middle of a busy highway during peak rush hour. He then had to arrange for a tow, miss an important meeting, and pay a heavy repair bill, all of which could have been avoided if he’d listened to his wife and mother. So, he learned the hard way, ignoring the problem only made it worse.","160,87,270,161,48,303,162,324,37,39,115,273,6,282,127,13,10,119,63,185,47,243,207,11,201,322,18,232,78,110,302,62,249,12,75,142,181,241,98,176,113,123,126,159,166,315,323,146,23,122,175,136,214,172,288,184,82,304,319,197,144,216,278,316,325,275,328,72,111,54,292,169,220,209,204,191,29,190,116,314,157,99,259,96,50,194,262,271,199,105,45,335,143,77,120,51,311,230,33,128,264,152,43,30,53,88,296,2,247,211,83,274,84,258,107,95,59,165,183,56,57,149,34,245,187,300,180,64,217,32,248,150,118,336,135,295,228,42,174,225,313,117,331,92,167,283,5,193,68,147,208,58,106,177,196,155,252,49,164,188,44,320,215,267,338,141,205,242,156,260,1,276,290,80,246,173,235,223,277,85,224,121,202,114,20,129,19,299,94,231,280,256,148,179,339,310,103,139,221,125","41,184,11,79,142,133,18,95,182,50,42","5, 11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35"
113,I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.,"Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.","197,258,263,154,11,117,151,161,116,304,209,288,27,87,111,4,273,185,121,269,10,229,219,319,234,255,287,60,76,40,35,271,24,37,105,63,326,18,284,243,179,127,132,118,108,228,0,141,327,275,324,264,13,44,69,314,136,93,90,294,238,280,267,321,64,317,153,274,272,39,51,253,244,3,170,310,300,169,45,204,88,214,192,186,171,65,94,95,86,160,235,202,146,133,257,42,172,91,226,220,120,55,89,232,236,72,21,147,17,309,158,137,83,282,268,28,23,97,329,81,99,100,188,115,109,231,296,303,318,126,200,68,194,36,206,149,129,47,308,33,79,212,112,7,207,102,316,246,142,332,239,49,222,123,249,122,208,247,38,181,114,1,215,130,337,119,210,103,110,41,182,16,265,173,53,254,31,198,301,277,48,168,59,134,260,92,227,174,307,140,159,305,252,250,336,224,56,167,85,328","143,161,124,9,6,44,166,101,19,156,154","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
114,Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.,"John and Sarah had been married for five years. The initial honeymoon phase faded away, and they started noticing each other's flaws and quirks. Small issues like not putting the toilet seat down or forgetting to pick up groceries on the way home, which used to go unnoticed, were now turning into a cause of frequent squabbles.

One day, their mutual friend Mike noticed the tension between them. He advised them to address and resolve these small issues before they grow into bigger problems. Mike reminded them of the love they shared and suggested focusing on open communication to understand each other's perspective.

Taking Mike's advice to heart, John and Sarah started resolving each small issue immediately instead of letting it fester. They openly discussed their expectations, frustrations, and found ways to compromise. Over time, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their relationship. This made them realize that resolving small issues immediately indeed prevented bigger troubles down the road.","122,177,232,331,323,75,258,117,34,305,13,186,112,145,290,296,239,221,140,148,72,1,46,282,228,89,299,208,326,55,198,107,115,163,280,182,257,172,301,86,15,168,303,92,329,71,185,253,276,210,108,268,310,190,5,28,95,213,255,205,10,261,104,17,338,256,32,59,300,161,146,264,283,183,123,302,254,54,27,51,3,6,38,197,147,91,153,93,111,160,251,105,260,209,333,98,43,45,16,36,85,320,113,128,317,275,90,332,245,66,44,106,154,278,173,284,322,96,327,81,321,319,120,141,152,118,52,56,127,263,311,130,179,100,103,250,259,178,49,0,216,313,136,292,295,231,88,14,39,188,129,304,279,201,214,243,137,61,138,287,293,35,116,20,176,37,150,121,158,222,211,277,192,248,94,220,202,219,87,76,336,272,83,212,200,273,69,230,266,181,274,307,40,126,223,240,119,180,73,166","13,103,33,163,8,126,197,123,168,1,75","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Because of his expertise, friends often approached him with their tech problems. One day, his friend, Lisa, approached him with a desperate expression on her face. Her laptop, which contained all her work and personal data, was refusing to boot up.

""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" John told her regretfully, ""it would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" He explained that the problem was a corrupt operating system. If it had been caught early on, he could have potentially restored the system or saved her data. However, the damage was now too extensive, and the system irreparable.

""But now, you may need to buy a new one,"" he suggested, noting her shocked expression. Although it was unfortunate news, John hoped that next time, Lisa would seek help immediately upon noticing an issue to avoid such a disastrous situation.","121,104,2,256,165,117,6,71,69,10,296,1,281,240,182,184,77,68,269,171,26,22,32,275,126,44,252,122,83,152,107,305,112,320,220,195,133,129,173,261,124,187,20,139,18,280,97,302,183,218,190,118,114,317,221,247,248,154,225,170,228,279,5,100,300,157,163,52,306,61,123,82,116,239,108,207,234,8,94,214,160,245,9,282,274,293,178,292,215,155,236,253,238,159,224,277,130,311,28,113,179,89,201,249,137,90,46,41,233,91,323,316,331,58,335,314,299,74,185,95,54,79,145,200,206,16,135,283,21,3,151,196,213,0,47,258,105,260,307,232,144,87,229,287,37,85,193,92,96,202,330,4,222,198,106,295,315,301,57,270,263,40,181,337,325,199,98,48,59,147,210,255,119,231,42,120,75,149,109,43,110,194,55,328,88,278,284,191,318,243,166,175,177,297,25,186,72,11,257,60","33,100,53,73,6,52,173,176,1,28,71","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

They drop the prices on all their luxury items, making it an event fashion enthusiasts in town don't dare to miss. Over the years, I've learned one important lesson: We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. 

The early bird catches the worm, as they say. The boutique opens at 8 am sharp on the sale day, but the line begins to form as early as 5 am. The most dedicated shopaholics even camp out overnight, trying to secure their place at the front of the line. They make the chilly dawn more than worth it with their triumphant smiles when they emerge from the boutique, their arms full of bags and their hearts full of satisfaction.

It isn't just about getting there early, it's about knowing what we want, grabbing it quickly, and getting it before someone else does. So let's get our coffee brewing at 4 am, brave the morning chill, and join the hustle of the boutique sale.

119,We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.,"As college students, we are always excited and anxious about the beginning of a new semester. The process of course registration is the first step to entering this new phase of our academic journey. Each semester, we are given the liberty to choose our courses and customize our learning experience. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. 

One major challenge we face during this time is getting a seat in the course we wish to register for. Some courses are extremely popular and have limited seats available. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat. 

This necessitates planning ahead and figuring out our course schedule well in advance. It's important to keep track of the dates when course registration opens and submit our choices immediately. Taking such steps ensures that we're not left out and can enjoy a fulfilling and productive semester.","127,329,91,204,69,198,67,256,88,7,28,148,36,209,339,278,90,191,267,116,287,229,186,54,178,110,139,187,117,281,10,128,43,5,85,279,215,84,82,16,112,175,202,109,246,89,115,26,17,80,210,9,72,75,328,111,298,255,250,31,258,253,154,182,0,105,181,231,121,324,230,300,288,260,177,270,268,327,238,24,291,222,313,1,63,251,106,135,304,292,38,225,101,264,220,114,242,83,133,335,206,212,153,211,136,23,319,218,263,52,40,173,331,283,58,330,87,325,19,160,193,155,70,164,269,338,39,64,107,303,118,285,123,337,8,226,223,308,207,323,266,20,46,294,150,295,157,237,305,334,138,239,73,290,257,214,172,252,34,49,42,315,296,235,33,243,282,37,273,55,310,98,81,113,166,217,163,301,162,59,77,326,302,241,158,51,293,203,248,122,216,228,318,94,48,30,120,189,213,134","41,174,96,47,20,29,131,197,69,190,133","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
120,"When the site was just discovered and undeveloped, Larry was able to purchase the home for a low price. Now, the price has risen to the point where even Will cannot afford it.","Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it. Larry's keen foresight had paid off, leaving him with not just a house, but a treasure trove.","236,82,67,50,60,330,94,336,124,243,273,318,325,232,126,86,231,128,305,166,292,46,304,88,284,47,19,188,55,286,131,241,274,148,244,121,77,214,242,237,193,138,184,212,218,240,249,33,48,80,43,6,125,112,18,234,335,332,181,337,28,136,119,16,205,107,285,171,164,39,103,152,75,147,303,322,245,338,23,176,159,20,21,106,100,56,317,157,68,175,215,307,8,339,12,156,118,10,116,302,179,190,17,158,129,297,326,275,79,255,281,319,228,293,135,265,22,248,66,177,59,252,72,216,219,264,314,331,26,311,25,73,328,37,109,143,197,76,151,97,7,9,196,127,69,104,250,315,187,113,222,38,202,203,130,91,101,220,321,310,160,49,239,260,327,84,145,117,169,154,122,221,163,139,123,114,98,64,301,70,278,333,115,1,224,229,173,204,235,161,31,223,287,34,27,2,95,300,14,58","54,150,176,183,99,168,97,63,36,171,175","11, 21, 27, 31, 40, 43, 51, 61, 71, 111"

She agreed, as she too craved the freshest, ripest fruits and vegetables for our kitchen. We prepared swiftly, eager to encounter the magic that the early morning market held.

Upon reaching the bustling farmer's market, we could immediately see the array of farm-fresh produce, handmade crafts, and baked goods on display. We headed first to Mr. Johnson's stall, knowing that he brings the juiciest apples and the crunchiest lettuce. Early birds like us got the finest picks, much better than the wilted leftovers during the noon rush.

Next, we scurried towards Mrs. Peters' bakery stand, the aroma of her freshly baked bread filling the air. Again, arriving early gave us the advantage of getting the warm, soft loaves, just out of the oven. As the day wore on, Mrs. Peter's beautiful pastries would disappear, leaving only a few less desirable choices.

Finally, with our bags brimming with the best produce and goods the market offered, we returned home satisfied. Arriving at the farmer's market early was indeed the key to securing the best batch. As the morning sun began to climb higher, we started preparing our meals, knowing that we had the freshest ingredients, thanks to our early morning adventure.","219,3,130,110,148,274,285,115,302,297,323,270,133,33,243,313,289,266,273,10,332,113,169,129,144,86,157,339,38,300,202,311,299,114,185,134,136,252,104,4,291,73,85,93,101,281,220,97,103,96,198,47,191,223,180,67,256,95,43,182,141,139,128,91,305,330,222,163,175,177,170,259,21,279,164,212,147,282,213,230,36,249,284,301,106,62,156,184,251,35,48,193,320,116,293,215,50,336,138,2,11,125,107,60,82,149,211,286,153,70,227,267,207,179,55,57,64,229,333,167,303,71,257,161,112,126,69,124,159,56,288,307,245,66,241,183,195,269,32,51,45,242,105,176,123,199,46,72,118,52,174,310,58,122,189,225,20,117,306,231,280,261,162,296,262,127,77,287,260,308,275,119,190,41,89,88,272,263,324,246,232,155,92,178,331,87,278,271,335,24,25,152,23,94,120,142,15,276,203,9","125,22,34,8,94,158,149,172,195,154,145","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward. When he finally arrived at the Senate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had heeded Martha's advice and left immediately.","85,328,48,93,276,182,120,155,147,12,284,117,150,221,153,149,52,158,112,29,321,67,97,202,114,255,211,281,235,324,41,47,229,135,86,55,45,183,233,246,307,230,87,54,196,171,203,51,184,312,294,71,224,166,95,200,285,191,299,290,123,207,3,118,205,179,244,192,42,225,107,72,293,201,178,119,213,32,320,43,193,109,59,13,157,90,127,329,219,306,310,115,138,28,113,35,337,76,24,11,228,323,132,137,83,238,37,249,311,154,98,9,92,223,260,22,40,38,208,126,188,300,186,330,8,163,152,309,89,227,239,275,283,148,243,298,168,174,165,315,217,101,303,10,124,133,286,270,339,248,231,110,189,58,130,121,21,269,23,69,325,185,70,305,57,62,141,232,266,53,271,16,267,111,164,335,274,116,82,73,258,108,143,131,295,175,291,144,25,106,204,302,279,272,169,216,31,296,79,94","19,95,25,92,178,12,64,76,7,156,61","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13"
123,"Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.","Joanna had always been a planner. So, when she decided to visit the city museum, she spent the evening strategizing the perfect timing. She knew that most of the museum visitors arrived between six and eight in the morning. The thought of having to negotiate her way through a crowd did not appeal to her.

Looking online, she found a blog suggesting that the ideal time to visit the museum was one hour before the peak hours. It wasn't just about beating the crowd, but also the opportunity to enjoy the exhibits in quiet reflection. Hence, she decided to arrive at the museum at five, an hour earlier than most visitors.

The next morning, she got ready and reached the museum at five sharp. As she stepped into the empty corridors of the museum, she was delighted. She had the entire place to herself, able to take her time and truly appreciate the exhibits. Joanna smiled, knowing her plan had worked out perfectly.","133,289,198,280,158,332,169,63,295,263,331,33,181,112,231,32,55,335,271,318,1,188,321,116,95,252,107,82,177,200,322,114,226,141,190,12,105,14,19,137,13,8,207,176,94,211,5,113,18,101,31,102,304,197,232,206,310,294,77,149,142,88,220,121,93,239,145,174,279,87,166,64,135,111,44,47,240,118,213,140,258,267,184,96,92,134,0,268,244,230,154,91,221,69,117,251,147,10,146,270,316,219,245,241,138,130,319,115,286,320,179,155,76,120,171,203,269,98,122,173,126,283,29,327,238,292,34,23,334,90,336,234,214,84,195,189,86,212,16,273,150,237,243,58,11,40,43,28,127,25,216,119,170,35,338,78,209,257,229,288,227,51,248,255,128,192,61,246,303,205,152,9,208,139,301,57,20,330,329,157,323,222,217,104,67,7,326,324,264,109,314,305,315,70,291,164,49,247,325,311","14,48,32,108,24,95,78,152,114,64,119","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

126,The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.,"The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. It's a bulky Dell model from 2006, dust collecting on its worn-out keys, and the other employees often joke about it. They can't comprehend why Lexi, the young, tech-savvy graphic designer, would choose such an obsolete piece of equipment. But she really enjoys using it.

There's something nostalgic about it; the satisfying click-clack of the keys, the faint humming noise, the old operating system. It reminds her of her first computer she got as a kid when she discovered her love for design. She was always fascinated by how she could create beautiful things with such a simple tool.

Lexi feels her creativity flowing more freely when she works on her old laptop, as if it's a part of her.

They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.","294,100,224,44,97,279,87,269,73,91,101,128,304,89,78,133,105,129,9,338,125,216,301,123,137,290,143,130,162,283,264,164,28,50,146,278,158,38,32,315,122,153,46,239,321,77,115,48,261,52,300,57,253,332,98,235,270,159,42,314,106,1,13,295,209,149,220,212,219,335,258,124,200,196,76,131,33,5,36,4,61,254,34,213,49,307,186,275,225,151,83,19,296,3,150,259,21,195,25,152,241,174,302,330,43,171,140,176,20,190,223,71,297,222,339,207,324,148,90,26,247,191,96,63,51,320,252,310,271,203,333,284,0,313,281,317,54,67,184,188,211,274,29,134,233,114,166,93,328,232,206,84,198,272,336,183,165,230,210,215,144,113,136,30,41,75,15,94,260,141,173,227,154,228,70,178,318,126,185,85,142,160,40,132,242,243,161,293,231,214,39,59,237,8,306,139,55,262,111,53","72,21,178,12,18","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
128,"Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.","Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics, seeing it merely as a jumble of numbers and variables that are not relatable to everyday life. Often, they regard math as a complicated series of equations and formulas to memorize. However, this perspective does not do justice to the richness and depth of this discipline. To me, mathematics is the most meaningful subject.

From an early age, I've always been fascinated by the harmony and precision found in mathematical concepts. The pure logic and absolute certainty captured in mathematical proofs provide a sense of satisfaction and comfort that no other subject can offer. As I manipulate figures and calculate equations, I feel a connection with the universe's fundamental laws and principles.

Every formula and theorem in mathematics reveals something profound about our world. It expresses abstract ideas like infinity and simplicity with an elegant language of numbers and symbols. Despite its complexity, the beauty of mathematics lies in its simplicity, consistency, and its ability to describe the world with absolute precision.

The process of solving a mathematical problem is like an exciting journey of discovery. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving a complex equation is unparalleled. This is the beauty I find in mathematics, making it, for me, the most meaningful subject.","63,168,14,160,267,229,292,196,277,237,50,104,140,209,333,308,148,304,77,211,264,17,208,232,331,9,100,3,97,306,305,256,45,247,327,316,65,130,212,90,271,44,154,101,315,321,294,127,317,116,58,268,246,324,11,132,284,240,95,71,54,138,236,181,7,339,278,114,129,245,166,6,296,13,216,75,328,15,186,146,310,163,142,81,137,124,282,34,94,295,189,109,285,165,291,302,72,215,297,289,106,41,252,177,135,31,307,89,220,42,279,156,171,22,254,329,290,62,24,288,66,125,123,70,53,78,243,274,99,250,10,141,29,318,110,218,145,38,194,74,25,73,169,275,49,83,84,164,157,107,260,36,32,200,98,319,103,0,184,222,139,205,19,119,33,258,185,193,112,197,61,204,322,115,199,8,206,231,198,234,188,210,337,159,309,126,1,20,242,235,39,300,195,172,249,60,255,202,120,51","86,122,186,48,69","2, 12, 24, 29, 31, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39"

Although this artist isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.

He would spend countless hours singing along to his songs and watching his concerts on YouTube.

He'd even taken to practicing the same techniques, humming the singer's songs in the shower or when he was alone in his room.

Yet for me, his music was a little too slow and didn't carry the energy and angst I preferred. I tried to appreciate it, for the sake of my brother, but it didn't quite resonate with me.

For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.","52,87,232,246,233,178,269,292,268,100,194,267,257,44,26,213,332,20,310,185,55,330,92,253,161,93,154,184,175,291,90,110,115,116,112,35,122,201,61,133,228,152,51,99,0,273,262,250,8,240,18,139,338,324,85,2,200,214,312,128,283,153,106,305,57,17,314,118,209,279,326,149,261,317,40,288,265,281,177,163,294,206,289,186,223,239,297,320,148,202,95,270,10,67,39,275,313,27,286,159,302,318,113,238,9,19,325,62,15,131,120,299,280,13,22,56,50,331,278,45,132,276,339,36,307,166,123,41,141,176,199,181,244,151,86,108,196,237,7,335,231,193,68,334,130,191,119,241,296,215,82,222,189,309,105,230,158,327,3,48,160,322,59,58,135,169,101,221,234,83,172,303,260,157,60,315,64,76,121,79,226,219,117,47,77,24,328,138,227,124,287,205,54,88,211,243,300,293,248,146","145,110,121,40,165","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

She held an unwavering belief in owning her mistakes and taking responsibility. However, when she wronged her best friend, Abigail, she found herself straying from her own rules. The incident happened during their annual Christmas party. In a fit of jealousy and misunderstanding, Rosalind had wrongly accused Abigail of trying to steal her boyfriend.

It took her a week to realize that her accusation had been mistaken; her boyfriend had been the one who initiated the flirtation. As she saw her friendship with Abigail crumble and fall apart, guilt and regret started to eat her alive. However, she let her pride get in the way, which stopped her from immediately apologizing and confessing to Abigail. Her ego created a barrier, and two painful years passed, with their friendship left in tatters.

Finally, she gathered the courage to swallow her pride and reach out to her friend. Rosalind wrote a heartfelt apology to Abigail, confessing to her mistake and expressing her deep regret. She wasn't sure if Abigail would forgive her, but she knew she had to take the first step to mend their broken friendship.","267,236,282,212,288,240,215,253,235,259,93,165,304,180,319,289,167,197,22,124,257,8,309,262,110,36,7,126,137,151,143,57,266,335,258,251,133,134,58,287,273,21,106,27,303,47,116,206,3,6,250,65,201,121,314,275,245,213,183,26,292,327,109,322,74,315,200,181,14,182,130,18,173,229,276,19,85,16,92,176,97,63,301,214,243,210,105,271,152,283,17,195,198,308,113,117,306,185,108,95,82,270,305,86,25,60,187,71,231,244,163,221,94,225,34,72,263,329,334,37,321,246,44,228,127,169,10,120,15,53,54,61,78,13,255,268,12,190,278,331,248,111,46,67,247,222,87,170,332,285,297,43,202,79,142,100,84,191,131,136,38,324,148,172,269,32,141,160,232,29,279,291,64,188,4,223,196,220,35,219,138,242,107,88,96,312,45,192,337,132,39,101,42,178,174,294,77,307,73,311","71,159,190,37,38","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket.""

137,It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.,"Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.","17,155,286,50,48,170,108,116,12,63,106,309,156,154,264,159,231,136,190,72,202,307,177,281,31,217,62,32,224,149,89,209,91,206,287,139,133,26,337,247,2,125,211,111,220,233,1,199,121,109,52,123,150,169,73,207,127,29,147,160,310,300,158,163,228,244,172,183,10,274,187,239,128,167,236,325,212,97,60,280,118,225,76,276,59,269,179,196,232,200,77,338,301,193,323,0,221,33,124,25,19,39,15,259,105,243,78,198,322,43,327,103,226,88,277,242,181,92,283,5,299,45,30,188,261,195,203,135,255,320,75,94,248,82,49,317,16,292,222,235,27,3,41,215,140,132,51,151,14,117,321,302,24,278,254,98,330,23,101,20,238,328,291,152,47,208,332,175,129,161,38,313,131,298,113,134,297,256,272,186,268,66,44,331,120,262,141,21,55,253,53,336,214,197,185,166,219,138,8,18","18,198,36,145,187","5, 14, 18, 19, 21, 27, 31, 34, 36, 37"

Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.","293,122,111,54,186,61,258,110,275,265,107,30,219,94,289,8,193,125,42,215,31,13,244,103,233,267,124,62,220,73,323,250,68,284,249,75,90,102,228,45,310,251,236,138,155,88,120,316,336,95,312,143,248,256,112,300,180,202,239,97,169,158,47,153,146,37,132,257,98,266,91,314,15,14,79,40,136,34,4,148,53,196,337,69,240,58,71,5,178,133,305,274,11,247,237,322,170,12,113,203,288,52,137,163,39,165,338,115,67,10,9,211,89,32,188,130,179,255,118,197,198,44,117,6,127,280,315,109,185,296,276,106,281,230,259,304,194,116,331,139,324,201,141,50,209,306,335,57,131,174,16,64,235,85,101,217,245,161,192,334,241,199,277,26,330,301,254,272,253,121,232,200,152,35,129,128,105,279,238,292,46,150,70,119,93,181,184,303,332,0,23,96,246,126,309,78,166,77,33,206","77,103,44,140,143","200, 199, 198, 197, 196, 195, 194, 193, 192, 191"
141,Having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people.,"Growing up in a diverse city, Sam always believed that having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people. This belief originated from his childhood, where he always felt enriched by different cultural experiences. Being a food lover, he loved trying diverse cuisines. His group of foodie friends always had something interesting planned, from authentic Indian curries to Italian pasta workshops.

On the other hand, Sam was a sports enthusiast as well. He had a separate group of friends who shared his love for football. Every weekend they would gather in the local park, pick teams, and enjoy intense football matches. Their bond strengthened during the world cup when they used to gather at Sam's house, cheering for their favourite teams.

His intellectual thirst was satisfied by his book club friends. They met once every month to discuss a book they had all read. Their conversations, heated debates, and perspectives helped Sam broaden his outlook on life. Thus, by maintaining different social groups, Sam was able to find companionship and a sense of belonging while pursuing his varied interests.","168,232,268,235,152,33,296,254,136,290,320,51,122,162,159,138,288,66,241,59,256,137,188,3,27,10,192,17,201,258,37,298,160,54,64,96,284,106,225,88,142,172,125,46,281,28,139,246,200,283,67,259,269,199,270,224,243,79,153,252,62,111,183,325,234,52,271,58,324,223,158,215,244,248,197,295,322,175,123,275,31,115,195,22,8,233,291,135,303,165,300,240,4,265,299,32,297,217,63,211,7,338,143,13,47,294,85,245,71,75,116,198,97,173,30,61,126,251,208,11,128,48,112,253,262,229,339,257,140,308,72,117,95,83,161,151,218,174,280,289,70,110,328,29,222,302,203,321,261,145,80,23,53,312,292,41,69,282,204,2,264,231,220,214,39,191,179,326,149,100,43,93,163,166,1,154,25,210,16,238,221,331,337,301,134,185,9,147,45,24,90,81,182,260,190,237,148,99,177,236","9,22,16,47,129","9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19"

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.","310,62,172,167,38,75,223,112,259,180,41,254,140,104,300,185,93,305,275,307,153,37,109,301,284,24,332,23,171,95,0,200,77,224,9,297,57,199,157,150,35,33,189,47,165,206,263,183,144,319,10,234,138,7,111,65,298,72,312,60,158,50,79,28,303,241,233,193,97,229,154,61,182,179,186,249,250,237,6,335,240,258,336,155,147,66,204,264,15,208,98,102,4,145,163,243,230,323,216,222,272,143,170,331,39,106,231,244,329,322,318,108,54,214,43,70,25,196,251,210,302,56,21,232,333,164,328,151,17,87,29,115,63,225,149,174,46,89,74,176,84,101,220,191,311,59,309,78,228,122,313,148,217,26,73,64,177,82,198,80,270,207,261,135,22,96,100,36,168,94,136,190,90,334,274,267,152,218,83,146,118,195,166,315,266,288,129,19,127,236,184,137,226,282,292,253,159,76,133,156","102,49,94,180,85","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

One day, he was assigned a complex project at work. His colleagues, Mike and Nancy, believed in taking shortcuts to finish the tasks quickly. They mocked John for his painstaking approach. John, however, didn't let their mockery deter him and he continued with his methodical approach. 

Weeks later, the project was presented to their boss. Mike and Nancy's hasty work resulted in many errors, leading to the project being sent back for corrections. John, on the other hand, had a flawless presentation, which not only impressed the boss, but also earned him a promotion. His mantra had once again proven to be true; doing your work thoroughly and responsibly really did help him avoid problems in the long run.","259,36,109,49,180,273,83,22,299,135,329,163,112,105,160,250,19,300,51,323,219,53,177,110,255,310,89,116,339,314,86,74,33,186,279,165,1,227,167,223,305,107,234,173,207,142,16,209,17,30,291,233,206,90,332,146,322,80,274,48,229,222,108,52,254,12,32,31,302,55,231,7,149,60,169,104,38,190,337,118,84,6,46,221,161,214,315,249,267,198,208,232,66,242,131,243,147,181,253,336,47,27,216,260,120,275,122,57,93,246,245,235,8,153,13,75,81,196,174,224,155,328,220,151,164,241,130,252,263,124,136,312,276,331,287,228,85,34,282,293,283,20,297,313,295,29,133,225,244,54,144,148,289,23,184,266,205,248,103,264,247,187,197,62,162,21,5,157,272,28,236,308,119,42,73,230,40,59,0,318,68,280,178,96,217,145,76,296,192,2,77,127,334,215,258,237,168,15,335,150","46,151,186,56,97","4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 22, 27, 30, 31, 36"
144,"Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.","In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.","184,296,126,130,215,275,289,315,282,193,7,66,304,60,85,88,52,242,230,182,162,150,219,79,147,105,199,160,173,38,148,71,200,322,217,243,16,165,287,197,168,67,125,61,308,292,170,297,77,327,299,53,295,320,101,64,145,117,278,81,183,157,20,338,166,80,100,191,194,236,227,192,339,21,189,121,12,317,102,22,298,104,220,133,246,153,312,248,75,161,185,277,301,234,94,309,288,186,264,267,167,169,54,159,281,233,305,196,229,228,211,95,156,135,207,152,26,337,132,139,42,11,334,63,14,83,175,188,36,129,44,332,37,313,146,316,241,270,127,113,74,290,103,285,32,268,25,198,8,307,57,202,179,258,244,328,141,46,216,204,271,143,201,18,6,213,154,266,176,178,99,106,142,35,250,260,27,28,73,276,155,122,210,134,237,87,5,333,136,128,23,19,45,172,151,10,261,82,251,259","173,162,57,135,25","2, 5, 18, 20, 21, 22, 29, 30, 31, 38"

148,"Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.","John had always been one to hustle. It was the way he approached everything in life, from his morning routine to his homework. His mentality was that the faster he got things done, the more time he had for other activities.

One day, his professor handed out a particularly challenging assignment. John, as usual, rushed through it, hoping to beat everyone else in submission. Hours later, he proudly handed in his paper, confident he was the first to finish.

The next week, he received his grade and was stunned to find he had a failing mark. He approached the professor who explained, ""You have made multiple glaring errors due to your hurry."" The teacher further said, ""Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.""

It was a life-altering lesson for John who realized that sometimes slowing down and dedicating time and effort can make all the difference.","239,228,202,292,82,89,175,49,124,303,162,221,87,298,33,199,72,300,172,187,150,35,120,36,18,128,200,151,304,261,2,50,224,256,232,69,332,109,226,247,71,12,266,7,108,95,48,118,116,302,225,105,13,268,309,242,179,331,132,74,323,182,155,152,337,320,86,289,17,177,329,64,274,10,167,11,37,92,38,324,147,245,293,28,276,60,252,5,310,336,243,181,299,230,319,31,278,139,214,130,146,195,8,22,65,209,94,41,265,67,194,79,201,183,313,119,212,99,178,249,54,88,133,125,153,264,27,135,66,306,52,216,103,39,220,231,241,156,218,204,246,258,101,81,311,70,123,250,90,62,163,267,141,227,149,85,159,188,186,279,240,56,213,80,291,63,43,248,236,190,219,222,106,191,314,59,281,29,164,112,173,269,102,14,57,21,111,203,294,78,301,104,270,330,326,272,317,170,127,180","155,21,28,64,125","9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21"

This leads to others having to fix his work.,"Larry was a hardworking fellow, always eager to get started and finish his tasks early. It was a trait that most admired about him. However, Larry had a flaw that often counteracted his zeal for efficiency; he would always jump into tasks without reading the requirements. 

On a typical Tuesday morning, Larry was tasked with a new project. Like always, he immediately got to work, not even sparing a glance at the comprehensive list of requirements laid out by the project manager. Larry's coworkers watched him with a mixture of admiration for his enthusiasm and dread, knowing that his haste would inevitably lead to unnecessary complications.

Hours turned into days, and Larry completed his project well ahead of schedule. But as was the norm, it soon became evident that his work was far from perfect. His colleagues grimaced, their predictions having come true. The project, though finished early, had major inconsistencies that they now had to spend their time fixing. Larry's persistent habit of starting work without understanding the requirements, despite helping him finish early, always ended up creating more work for others.","330,276,5,247,78,88,61,145,79,105,130,209,134,122,242,125,212,255,249,83,303,152,160,294,274,326,2,56,154,163,283,189,129,205,333,67,58,164,93,147,4,111,121,151,250,252,235,181,86,148,48,94,222,84,227,12,62,120,44,60,7,96,63,206,211,180,313,327,195,216,10,291,37,265,230,267,232,36,100,236,153,19,336,248,155,218,302,243,307,91,201,116,89,273,312,325,306,290,197,14,87,141,82,73,301,175,137,142,135,332,268,215,226,123,258,3,270,188,263,32,257,68,41,54,95,166,132,90,85,238,266,176,219,338,103,172,287,311,50,81,334,117,297,150,293,0,76,75,168,65,25,30,21,315,16,124,138,39,18,97,192,198,34,245,272,157,199,26,339,53,228,46,317,225,143,289,305,31,9,320,24,185,47,99,51,71,204,170,165,77,29,45,171,224,186,43,136,104,324,52","50,144,44,22,81","4, 5, 20, 34, 35, 49, 50, 69, 74, 92"

So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.","114,220,318,92,194,186,280,40,190,151,153,75,286,162,233,64,155,297,109,59,288,248,208,316,179,253,134,262,252,212,193,127,333,274,31,129,185,17,305,96,210,4,83,205,261,77,241,171,203,117,135,115,296,74,234,204,265,97,195,14,60,202,209,124,197,256,79,175,66,273,141,9,102,225,45,173,279,100,116,268,260,90,301,201,327,263,49,192,272,178,222,42,20,73,177,163,235,198,133,29,26,284,50,65,71,335,276,245,270,123,180,238,87,303,167,302,125,249,19,312,6,21,99,16,338,0,329,98,68,215,227,287,63,314,11,2,289,103,51,226,24,91,292,118,146,282,27,161,88,61,120,277,200,37,307,300,126,144,85,147,56,236,191,218,216,299,184,321,267,283,152,30,166,306,165,264,149,237,240,223,148,232,52,168,44,196,290,317,110,18,244,101,159,34,33,10,36,258,323,1","181,177,10,171,11","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14"

The presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.,"The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.","284,255,278,161,20,35,36,137,331,245,99,280,271,269,68,265,193,118,96,174,242,237,244,120,258,159,181,256,50,279,194,241,152,94,146,165,296,251,79,292,75,216,154,112,201,150,207,206,122,282,273,249,330,259,169,134,147,145,304,121,107,93,322,267,285,2,262,204,275,109,141,230,310,56,123,142,22,191,98,189,175,63,153,205,171,162,24,298,149,17,179,190,80,195,247,155,45,55,70,47,222,196,167,313,16,148,208,128,73,170,110,81,52,66,23,277,219,88,252,10,302,26,307,67,127,178,11,294,59,71,198,5,135,156,221,183,305,203,160,114,77,115,138,240,82,225,266,53,76,132,136,9,224,321,229,86,139,65,223,311,186,28,264,38,92,212,7,15,299,21,209,41,327,200,228,211,182,105,272,61,0,101,214,180,116,188,30,184,232,319,13,332,309,34,260,238,176,119,42,74","106,89,46,33,83","2, 8, 12, 21, 22, 26, 27, 32, 35, 37"

Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection.

Eventually, after an intensive examination, a sense of achievement filled his tired eyes. He had not just a lead, but a plausible theory about the perpetrators of the heists.

He was no stranger to running, but marathons were an entirely new ballgame. His coach had given him one primary advice, ""Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon,"" he had said. 

John remembered his words clearly. He felt the thrill of the starting gunshot echoing in his ears. An impulse surged through him to dash off with the crowd, but he reined in his energy. He had trained hard and didn't want to waste his endurance in the first few miles. 

Instead, he started at a manageable pace. As he passed each mile, he slowly increased his speed. This strategy kept him fresh even in the later stages of the race, and as he crossed the finish line, he knew he had done it right. His adherence to maintaining a steady pace and avoiding a rapid start paid off. The joy of completion paired with a decent time made all his efforts worthwhile.

His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.","255,99,85,286,7,321,325,304,191,57,335,22,59,128,135,131,32,295,205,212,49,173,150,141,86,153,156,180,155,123,194,188,181,296,2,264,282,130,97,261,185,272,10,26,78,224,127,218,336,179,165,268,81,241,198,40,337,116,221,161,47,157,190,13,148,52,281,147,132,270,17,122,257,313,125,104,209,106,263,133,117,240,14,311,226,61,334,120,302,152,227,143,73,242,15,203,235,193,111,204,308,44,316,200,259,312,23,163,254,63,169,315,300,19,93,103,274,76,233,142,164,288,217,328,28,29,250,265,34,50,170,168,283,172,251,113,110,3,322,303,260,225,121,134,278,33,323,232,330,287,149,215,5,68,137,293,317,70,138,184,72,329,96,213,236,292,279,234,222,258,189,269,45,162,318,158,140,266,273,112,92,102,201,310,108,98,94,174,136,253,327,245,223,160,37,298,159,276,80,220","29,27,62,176,197,194,60,174,108,121,51","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
155,There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.,"Sarah had always been a very self-critical person. After each job interview, she'd sit in her car replaying every detail, from the way she shook the interviewer's hand, to the tone in which she answered questions. She would often chastise herself for not using more impressive vocabulary or for failing to mention some minor accomplishment. ""There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview,"" her older brother advised, sensing her post-interview stress.

He reminded her that, once the interview was over, she could not change anything she'd said or done. All she could do was wait for a decision. ""Move on to the next one,"" he encouraged her, further explaining that dwelling on the past would only rob her of the focus and energy needed for upcoming opportunities. 

Trying to heed his advice, Sarah started to look ahead, preparing for her next interview instead of dwelling on the past ones. She realized that she could learn from her perceived mistakes and apply those lessons in the future. Eventually, she found that this forward-thinking strategy helped alleviate her post-interview stress and made her perform better in subsequent ones. The regret was replaced by a sense of learning and personal growth, which was a far more constructive approach.","330,29,217,302,2,176,230,294,153,158,174,147,189,260,225,182,4,117,267,160,214,316,167,44,236,20,107,241,41,22,81,101,124,283,21,318,100,282,310,201,148,173,289,304,186,94,185,293,27,151,116,161,95,232,102,159,5,30,12,114,197,248,262,72,66,280,61,243,305,240,156,245,288,9,16,8,253,83,154,112,17,337,126,128,295,60,19,64,177,195,180,162,303,7,313,191,23,268,271,300,15,172,67,263,111,78,59,163,96,281,193,145,58,165,79,73,207,311,314,212,235,211,278,10,287,143,256,312,6,93,200,70,269,13,164,120,113,259,216,296,62,26,208,198,51,254,136,140,118,103,63,18,132,46,183,115,157,308,234,139,204,202,320,257,192,272,35,84,131,90,98,292,315,110,265,244,54,252,49,99,227,144,85,50,53,206,36,105,219,334,55,31,71,220,199,321,40,135,325,33","79,71,157,10,56,20,52,92,108,135,114","9, 10, 12, 19, 20, 32, 33, 42, 50, 52"

The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.","25,178,243,103,336,303,92,127,338,154,8,236,120,22,320,170,278,315,84,132,223,313,202,334,186,151,175,276,21,107,302,66,169,85,162,307,253,145,172,13,335,240,48,166,325,289,157,165,332,221,147,288,104,105,80,235,36,199,268,45,295,210,317,281,304,28,163,227,314,308,284,76,306,134,322,228,215,11,183,310,89,59,274,62,52,195,330,261,49,216,269,316,270,190,292,53,149,16,57,119,95,233,70,245,296,224,208,141,124,17,33,272,23,264,144,74,32,171,161,214,135,293,231,142,2,271,125,126,130,298,321,39,184,64,207,87,176,318,249,218,333,160,110,5,311,196,168,26,164,260,113,40,139,331,131,327,159,158,47,37,148,204,9,242,174,99,152,97,121,200,300,187,15,239,29,155,252,201,262,136,114,67,250,323,108,153,86,254,244,143,79,257,211,282,54,248,319,203,290,6","10,176,47,158,157,142,119,35,67,149,48","2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 34"

It had been her favorite spot to read, and she had spent countless hours nestled in its sturdy branches. Then one day, a violent storm swept through their town, uprooting the mighty tree Juli loved so much. When Juli saw the tree in its fallen state, her heart ached with a sorrow that she could not put into words.

Understanding her sorrow, her father, who was a gifted artist, decided to immortalize the tree in a way only he could. He spent days working tirelessly, capturing every detail from the gnarled roots to the endless branches that had once reached towards the heavens. When he was done, he presented the painting to Juli with an apologetic smile.

He told her, ""There's nothing else we could do, Juli,"" his words full of empathy for his daughter's loss. The painting was a spectacular rendition of her favorite tree, standing tall and mighty just like how she remembered it. Juli found solace in her father's gift and realized that even though the tree had physically vanished from their backyard, it would forever remain alive in her heart and her father's masterpiece.","165,167,18,63,325,94,124,85,16,171,231,13,335,24,232,237,135,223,185,274,103,323,73,76,140,309,26,79,141,253,285,168,0,97,139,44,216,319,235,331,289,256,244,67,318,164,154,70,43,260,129,293,249,148,288,90,211,142,262,181,228,269,208,175,267,19,53,177,143,301,305,217,107,332,25,186,316,264,162,72,337,310,169,183,191,95,153,10,68,298,14,99,23,106,149,336,202,188,110,195,250,282,258,254,322,304,159,56,156,230,241,330,278,2,150,312,65,334,329,74,115,273,138,255,12,265,96,234,196,246,283,302,54,290,146,114,1,83,242,199,163,112,184,32,247,116,166,158,161,30,272,294,105,111,200,279,137,28,45,71,155,212,243,248,117,88,299,204,170,59,198,176,64,134,113,214,218,222,127,194,275,136,126,52,80,160,295,315,259,205,308,11,92,20,300,118,125,276,31,104","47,161,109,148,107,186,149,79,141,46,1","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were.

We supported different teams; he was always a diehard fan of England, and I passionately supported Argentina. Every four years, the World Cup gave rise to friendly rivalry between us. Our time would be spent poking fun at the players of each other's team and predicting the loss of the other.

This year, however, the World Cup had taken a different turn. Both England and Argentina were knocked out in the quarter-finals. We stared at the television screen in shared disappointment and disbelief. Silence fell between us as we came to terms with the defeat of our respective teams.

John nodded, and we settled down, deciding to enjoy the rest of the tournament together without any rivalry.","275,160,291,247,322,328,159,311,323,223,129,83,163,334,236,18,102,37,12,292,202,153,222,77,70,7,194,144,265,148,316,177,169,150,1,10,135,294,61,20,53,39,151,327,60,146,184,295,122,26,52,67,155,272,24,318,58,256,300,127,288,46,117,174,269,99,224,330,76,28,100,221,121,198,203,186,134,154,123,156,142,97,139,59,128,93,45,113,5,56,280,103,42,176,227,133,308,132,87,314,253,206,181,200,89,304,315,312,124,94,237,168,326,106,157,111,246,47,232,74,298,261,101,309,257,167,4,283,50,196,251,138,82,183,204,116,208,201,140,271,258,228,158,303,286,329,339,187,40,282,16,259,31,9,212,73,217,193,78,115,54,214,338,243,119,17,245,166,120,0,62,162,287,260,333,11,211,65,175,165,279,105,30,254,299,197,226,6,136,118,331,164,189,114,15,270,302,207,90,23","78,53,80,115,143,7,2,172,13,192,180","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
162,Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.,"The tension between Emma and Ethan was palpable. They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.","174,147,153,98,262,177,249,79,95,261,215,130,250,309,39,89,124,34,222,109,164,60,203,127,17,191,175,80,145,83,0,46,78,36,239,297,217,285,218,116,76,62,48,228,324,220,186,9,156,226,336,260,168,101,206,2,160,172,35,136,125,187,227,74,330,195,292,53,128,243,47,259,230,254,165,8,33,30,207,273,121,314,99,146,329,281,148,50,51,235,44,158,159,296,140,335,115,238,21,288,276,269,196,268,316,181,154,122,104,264,312,212,71,293,114,81,144,87,42,282,82,18,246,27,278,192,233,10,157,7,214,307,52,139,301,310,252,251,229,142,138,245,173,270,204,202,318,129,45,271,151,149,267,117,25,73,150,137,94,92,323,183,40,13,37,75,178,237,304,163,255,265,90,311,200,193,201,180,161,5,100,313,197,332,198,119,283,287,155,333,61,205,179,59,241,103,20,102,199,291","107,189,49,129,92,93,57,179,170,21,75","2, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 23, 26"
163,The brother and sister decided to stop the fight and decided to be cordial again.,"Growing up, Tom and Emily, though siblings, never seemed to get along. They were as different as night and day, always finding a reason to argue about anything. The summer before they left for different colleges, however, an all-out fight broke out over their shared car.

It was a small disagreement about who would get the car for the weekend but it escalated into a major brawl. Years of pent-up frustrations were laid bare, harsh words were spoken, and the fight ended with both of them not talking to each other for weeks.

It was their mother who finally forced them to sit down and talk about their issues, making it clear that they should deal with their differences. They started to realize that their fights were not worth the love they shared as siblings. 

With a newfound understanding, the brother and sister decided to stop the fight and decided to be cordial again. It was a conscious choice and required constant effort, but they began to communicate better, listening rather than arguing. Their relationship improved significantly, and they realized they could enjoy each other's company, which made their parents incredibly happy.","207,13,26,16,150,54,149,9,257,108,30,79,60,192,188,272,168,208,277,292,193,334,140,211,147,143,53,196,155,205,70,166,237,317,202,95,298,273,112,114,145,38,266,5,21,181,253,104,191,15,101,169,67,18,165,89,297,94,61,175,215,209,314,244,226,308,302,335,121,296,81,69,160,259,281,55,213,241,180,311,251,229,321,103,156,59,1,223,119,187,288,102,301,218,91,40,153,122,80,134,294,203,27,71,233,179,75,111,284,22,201,130,96,139,62,4,25,116,20,110,148,239,162,158,240,161,65,34,44,8,83,144,263,338,324,172,242,248,328,231,142,82,154,131,159,300,214,316,11,0,336,306,293,315,73,24,97,236,135,330,35,43,100,295,84,151,124,157,85,267,289,123,3,303,17,77,63,216,337,164,2,282,52,264,120,286,285,279,304,93,64,78,234,118,309,256,291,32,6,200","143,29,85,168,124,145,73,126,123,180,55","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship. The war was over, and the world had chosen peace.","20,66,230,336,99,236,266,307,106,291,175,74,86,161,178,337,328,223,88,261,271,89,264,285,57,158,317,41,203,275,320,257,19,38,169,10,155,330,198,33,190,300,216,53,138,0,58,282,171,250,71,76,226,62,181,90,127,179,103,270,4,156,318,288,278,162,220,322,112,3,256,135,87,139,35,339,157,98,302,304,218,247,17,263,37,81,212,45,24,249,140,225,184,110,18,297,208,123,160,283,301,205,312,83,56,269,238,130,177,25,224,27,84,191,213,252,91,284,95,43,165,128,313,294,115,154,145,199,144,253,200,131,192,168,124,12,338,276,142,125,327,42,72,227,105,75,137,240,55,314,163,170,67,228,242,31,221,277,143,159,292,311,80,48,151,265,324,295,96,2,73,319,217,152,64,8,174,232,193,188,150,147,5,196,244,323,274,210,267,215,60,114,69,102,121,172,78,100,233,243","126,37,62,77,26,160,99,14,66,151,121","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom.

168,The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.,"Mr. Davis, a seasoned mathematics teacher, had been grappling with the challenging task of explaining the concept of calculus to his class. Over several weeks, he'd attempted various methods, yet felt he hadn't fully reached his students. His frustration was growing, but he refused to give up, knowing the importance of this particular topic.

One day, he stumbled upon an interactive mathematics game online, which presented complex topics in a simplified, engaging manner. With newfound optimism, he decided to incorporate this method into his teaching. The following day, he introduced the game to his students, explaining that it would be their new means of understanding calculus. 

As the days passed, he watched their progress closely, anticipating that he was onto something. Soon, their class participation, homework submissions, and test scores indicated a surge in understanding. It was the day when one of the most quiet students voluntarily solved a complex problem on the board that Mr. Davis knew he had finally succeeded.

169,Samantha was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.,"Samantha's relationship with David had been rocky of late. Many late nights and tiffs over trust issues had created a chasm between them. Samantha, at her wit's end, decided to test their bond once more.

She had planned a surprise getaway for them to mend their worn out hearts. But a tempting event arose which had always been on David's bucket list. Samantha had firmly told David about the surprise on the same date as the event, hoping that he would choose their relationship over his individual pursuit.

The day arrived, Samantha packed her bags and hoped for the best. She reached the set destination, her heart pounding heavily against her chest. She held her breath when she saw a figure approaching in the distance. Relief washed over her as she recognised David's features, and she was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.","75,120,209,265,15,59,302,90,295,130,46,134,76,305,69,73,220,35,57,222,116,27,205,113,234,37,231,114,70,215,42,150,219,288,246,159,107,103,282,225,77,165,326,232,43,109,36,230,24,168,323,158,80,257,126,93,338,62,151,211,238,213,140,258,199,187,166,278,318,204,124,85,293,248,217,31,308,294,167,88,54,2,45,145,196,97,131,19,254,47,104,269,279,4,317,241,260,255,307,156,122,175,112,226,17,144,298,306,92,195,244,190,71,39,149,198,203,56,189,243,227,223,0,129,170,327,252,171,5,174,206,135,214,20,197,208,66,202,65,63,221,173,8,58,291,176,330,299,6,235,67,267,172,22,201,264,89,297,91,155,55,275,321,105,212,276,139,128,283,111,143,249,334,121,314,333,332,233,79,289,154,324,148,178,138,9,23,329,277,10,286,281,322,153,310,161,274,266,81,68","67,79,50,125,128","1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 17, 24, 28, 29, 30"
170,"Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.","Seeing my old friend Mark after so long, I was ecstatic to hear that his child had reached a significant milestone. ""Wow, your kid just graduated middle school!"" I exclaimed, hardly believing how much time had passed since our own school days. 

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.","228,107,213,14,74,308,175,202,39,50,102,98,200,230,149,257,34,127,317,338,301,168,227,297,197,132,99,115,325,36,105,90,144,136,277,134,145,311,312,89,240,198,237,243,178,182,24,77,212,180,58,220,247,226,186,307,32,130,286,279,9,35,181,244,110,305,328,43,177,261,42,85,95,316,303,135,10,12,153,215,25,295,209,267,126,288,331,167,67,284,260,92,324,253,291,94,5,128,304,169,103,117,84,38,214,249,163,60,192,154,171,283,335,139,313,241,119,109,302,239,266,174,231,293,66,93,269,150,0,27,91,148,2,51,262,259,131,143,22,276,147,210,30,53,124,104,292,299,268,321,233,314,278,63,265,285,294,18,336,57,13,242,157,86,273,151,82,329,251,327,8,46,142,320,179,80,23,296,31,15,100,75,68,332,238,263,116,208,28,76,300,37,40,69,225,78,166,205,161,26","197,88,22,100,111","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

Today, as David walked around inspecting the diner, he couldn't help but notice the sparkly clean floor. His shoes made no squeaking noise, and he felt no slip under his soles. The stern lines on David's face dissolved into a broad smile, filling him with overjoying pride for his new hire.

176,They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back.,"The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.","174,23,122,75,14,280,196,142,234,279,337,226,26,112,209,224,51,152,118,171,49,98,322,206,190,83,212,45,269,0,88,161,95,24,36,63,156,320,182,65,241,238,20,168,91,277,329,255,3,249,172,310,253,222,33,5,90,101,321,216,260,170,117,291,300,105,134,225,106,246,256,58,194,159,110,221,302,327,120,166,242,84,97,336,141,316,9,56,151,258,42,233,28,157,266,128,130,261,113,29,64,232,136,331,4,40,2,70,325,72,8,229,30,131,294,123,54,252,150,154,198,189,236,324,79,82,25,288,214,107,1,217,240,181,32,275,114,180,31,175,76,187,116,111,11,204,177,199,307,263,15,314,34,332,283,186,18,22,129,149,53,333,109,6,46,306,135,290,71,179,160,213,330,143,52,85,80,317,27,183,147,309,19,13,313,205,78,262,173,208,48,308,124,121,67,37,235,339,74,304","51,189,1,140,147","1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27"

At first, Lena thought about confronting him. Yet she knew well enough that he would dismiss her instantly, putting her and her family in financial hardship. Therefore, she decided to play it cool, pretending like she knew nothing, all the while gathering evidence to back her up.

The boss, on the other hand, remained oblivious to her newfound knowledge. He continued conducting his shady business, confident that no one could touch him.

We grew up next door, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures in our small, quiet town. The bond was genuine, and I believed we'd always be there for each other. However, as we grew older and life became more complex, I noticed a change in Jack's behavior.

Our conversations started becoming one-sided with him ignoring my words and even belittling my opinions. It stung more than I was willing to admit. That was not the Jack I knew and cherished. The Jack I knew was empathetic, understanding, and most importantly, respectful. Thus, I couldn't help but hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In response, I distanced myself, feeling betrayed and upset. I missed our old friendship, but I couldn't overlook his disrespectful behavior. With time, I managed to accept the change, holding onto the memories of our past and hoping that one day, the Jack I once knew would return.","44,260,152,93,99,269,320,3,125,42,259,289,226,209,236,86,77,286,92,154,222,100,224,8,228,330,47,12,148,62,244,156,331,61,328,218,243,317,240,140,126,314,182,60,14,142,225,251,307,297,241,306,25,73,134,28,11,227,215,151,160,263,59,242,54,34,318,295,255,71,204,262,186,300,310,4,172,304,48,325,293,200,117,267,96,311,23,83,302,191,179,169,329,91,170,7,56,220,250,188,334,118,229,88,212,89,133,252,336,217,165,21,171,214,184,290,57,150,105,280,279,327,79,74,124,253,238,284,18,185,147,114,257,122,72,81,101,84,119,146,338,80,15,322,162,315,95,175,75,136,69,135,309,323,174,296,291,20,155,36,270,337,138,177,17,194,128,274,26,198,55,130,129,272,180,288,29,145,285,1,173,38,324,70,78,111,137,163,53,76,27,268,183,305,158,30,108,157,181,308","91,175,199,43,193","9, 11, 14, 18, 30, 32, 41, 51, 55, 73"

But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry, my wedding marred by the startling realization that Kim had chosen not to support me on my special day.","157,2,68,275,171,10,260,142,322,329,165,17,181,156,33,238,39,271,110,134,178,263,159,60,218,247,57,41,36,186,232,196,200,108,154,152,42,307,293,177,314,82,126,130,333,231,256,88,324,249,95,334,259,18,302,47,237,323,315,32,246,127,180,81,93,300,212,102,325,321,63,149,53,294,227,19,98,48,225,22,198,277,115,170,304,272,189,114,248,328,128,276,270,173,52,90,107,172,289,266,75,280,23,12,243,96,265,61,193,148,221,0,59,38,331,303,11,16,327,147,113,284,215,5,336,26,273,279,182,338,285,104,202,116,120,111,220,214,250,262,78,317,20,143,103,211,207,37,164,97,14,133,310,158,124,44,257,291,309,1,292,228,183,83,125,318,94,201,217,163,76,70,4,85,27,49,109,155,106,281,299,229,123,286,311,252,56,251,71,176,119,51,312,335,234,223,141,135,244,9","21,63,13,129,163","3, 13, 21, 22, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35"

Thus, when she discovered that Sandy, her best friend since grade school, had made plans for the summer without informing her, she felt a sting of betrayal. 

For years, they had shared every intricate detail of their lives, right down to what they had for breakfast. That's why Sandy's silence about her summer plans had taken Karen aback. It wasn't that Karen expected to be included in every aspect of Sandy's life, but the sudden change in their routine felt abrupt and unexpected.

The girls had been studying for their upcoming finals when Amy, stressed and overworked, lost her temper. She berated Mary in a fit of frustration, accusing her of not taking their studies seriously. Mary, taken aback by Amy's outburst, felt hurt by the harsh words. It wasn't just the content, but the tone in which Amy had spoken to her that upset Mary deeply. 

Ever since that incident, Mary stopped talking to Amy. The harshness of Amy's words had stung her deeply, creating a rift that would take time to heal.","94,67,186,131,110,274,205,127,232,223,32,1,293,132,237,163,201,37,243,66,181,339,14,51,61,276,9,89,85,238,326,228,165,166,43,83,27,306,121,300,116,39,81,108,295,119,284,258,151,185,250,182,190,155,20,202,103,120,31,129,93,298,198,87,98,36,146,115,161,311,80,102,317,21,91,105,59,221,235,288,207,254,162,139,142,109,217,301,6,225,233,128,17,72,58,282,86,246,16,75,240,34,104,2,304,140,319,211,224,305,214,271,329,158,33,281,196,222,267,79,322,117,24,148,118,263,44,242,241,55,178,193,111,252,68,277,106,325,122,209,13,227,152,292,100,332,144,239,53,19,145,215,40,175,334,280,251,197,191,171,194,283,179,156,56,287,164,308,141,249,188,289,290,54,63,336,337,328,52,324,192,307,3,268,180,153,296,208,291,314,285,256,247,269,187,135,62,312,15,11","131,163,185,21,52","1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 21, 25"

Finally, after years of practicing and getting motivation from his friends, he decided to give his dream a shot. The local theatre group was holding auditions for their renowned dance team that day, the perfect opportunity for Lester.

Yet, time slipped from Lester's hands as he double-checked every detail. From his costume to the dance steps, he didn't want to leave any room for mistakes. With this meticulous preparation, he was running extremely late and the audition was about to be closed.

They were a menacing force, relentless and ruthless, conducting their operations in the shadows. The mere thought of crossing paths with them was a nightmare. Yet, they had an individual on their radar, a man named Peter.

People thought it impossible to escape their relentless pursuit, but Peter was not ordinary. Peter, an unassuming yet resilient man, found himself caught up in their web. He was under constant surveillance, and any wrong move would have dire consequences.

One day, Peter received an anonymous tip-off about a plan to arrest him. It was then that he plotted his daring escape. Relying on his intelligence and quick thinking, Peter successfully managed to escape, narrowly avoiding their traps. The escape was far too close for comfort, giving him several heart-stopping moments, but he managed to slip away nonetheless. 

Word of Peter's daring escape spread among the citizens, igniting hope.

190,"Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.","Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.","294,177,290,288,282,202,32,64,34,51,98,160,176,327,234,143,42,11,183,110,221,48,62,15,301,222,73,159,7,198,193,217,152,8,212,92,300,150,316,179,118,27,149,101,182,136,85,265,31,20,318,30,267,321,205,219,141,289,82,104,134,293,109,44,223,197,22,84,59,269,224,218,50,39,235,229,95,12,279,261,0,151,66,69,68,6,231,286,155,208,144,89,245,320,244,306,117,200,167,189,324,122,227,107,307,259,213,111,258,2,302,99,116,201,5,121,216,55,137,287,58,272,49,281,207,260,266,195,187,262,133,102,233,72,228,46,252,24,278,230,19,240,312,314,108,178,308,241,125,40,93,124,254,139,38,54,120,275,156,115,325,61,70,106,337,23,257,255,220,249,154,239,283,263,147,309,276,90,206,238,80,334,130,185,285,284,113,37,21,191,317,164,333,211,17,194,158,29,192,13","190,199,31,196,128","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13"
191,It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.,"On a typical weekday morning, Tom woke up and thought of a new challenge - he decided to drive to his office for the first time. Having only recently acquired his driving license, Tom was eager to flaunt his new skill. Looking out the window, he saw the bustle of the city roads, and naively thought, ""It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic."" 

As he got into his car, a sense of determination flooded him. He started his journey, but very soon was submerged into the chaotic labyrinth of urban traffic. Cars of all sizes were trying to outsmart each other, trying to find any room possible to pass through. The honking horns and the frequent brake lights turned his simple morning drive into a nerve-racking test. 

An hour passed in what seemed like an eternity, and Tom found himself only halfway to his destination. He then realized the truth of the common saying, ""Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos."" Wiping the sweat off his brow, Tom quietly admired those who braved these roads daily. He understood that driving wasn't just about controlling the steering wheel, but it also required adaptability and a lot of patience. He decided then and there that he needed more practice before he could join the ranks of those seasoned drivers.","71,38,289,229,332,29,254,176,118,178,97,75,20,101,253,162,337,312,291,199,30,41,226,125,309,34,81,231,308,279,103,311,98,193,100,69,339,286,96,108,165,159,154,157,237,148,126,152,68,8,184,14,26,259,53,306,290,181,95,85,136,142,331,61,260,302,258,251,249,173,52,211,168,328,276,175,196,230,225,314,243,166,115,183,257,318,287,74,241,195,4,130,200,189,256,224,264,206,267,201,23,170,67,336,7,215,147,133,32,93,62,198,283,296,234,238,45,186,202,190,179,113,172,240,138,50,60,182,94,24,36,79,219,88,298,63,217,66,46,325,293,18,274,171,141,64,127,107,137,27,11,91,21,57,292,2,161,49,297,307,86,177,139,153,58,112,333,124,317,160,327,205,78,204,280,89,207,222,192,236,321,128,255,232,5,320,25,216,72,145,121,37,194,269,266,246,330,48,156,244","120,179,34,193,90","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
192,"It takes a lot of effort to write a novel, so do not think writers do nothing worthy.","Writing a novel is not a walk in the park; it requires an incredible amount of effort. Many people underestimate the work writers put into their craft, assuming that because they are not in a traditional 9-to-5 job, they do not perform anything worthy. However, this could not be further from the truth. 

The initial stage of writing a novel often involves extensive research. This can take months or even years, depending on the subject matter. It involves getting to know characters, their motivations, and the world they live in. Once the research is complete, the planning stage begins. Every scene must be meticulously thought out and linked seamlessly to create a coherent and engaging story.

Then, comes the actual writing which can take months, or even years of dedication and hard work. It involves countless revisions and proofreading to ensure that the story is well structured and error-free. After all this, the novel must be pitched to publishers, a task that requires a different set of skills altogether. The publishing process itself can be a grueling journey. So, let us not undervalue the hard work that writers put into their craft. Writing a novel is an enormous undertaking that requires persistence, creativity, and dedication.","251,262,179,138,240,167,237,91,309,86,271,22,225,281,16,68,232,128,121,43,118,292,206,313,93,222,284,89,280,80,66,20,295,323,33,111,61,255,9,258,216,267,65,238,250,190,228,331,339,277,199,97,28,218,299,59,154,72,60,81,124,322,227,75,306,289,305,19,176,169,197,134,34,279,259,226,136,224,123,182,338,112,57,143,54,131,102,108,105,209,142,158,301,310,1,241,73,79,247,275,85,148,230,161,51,149,174,315,130,317,278,31,168,193,257,64,201,44,336,242,99,116,70,52,211,276,191,319,183,235,266,140,74,324,270,114,223,205,151,67,125,194,15,23,261,293,137,29,40,155,184,291,195,11,307,273,42,245,217,178,196,268,27,177,7,173,71,308,229,10,188,94,312,135,297,186,202,14,24,252,165,244,110,330,160,164,311,302,260,0,145,298,84,212,13,38,314,18,208,163","46,127,114,142,153","2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21"
193,Victor thought acting is an easy and useless job until he joined a theater class and performed for the first time. He realised it is an art form not everyone can master.,"Victor always believed that actors simply got paid for doing practically nothing. In his eyes, acting was a trivial pursuit, devoid of complexity or depth. After all, it was just pretending to be someone else, nothing more. However, everything changed when he decided to join a local theater class on a whim. 

On his first day in class, Victor quickly realised he was out of his depth. The passion his classmates exhibited was palpitous and the seriousness with which they approached their roles took him aback. Not only did acting demand physical stamina, but it also required immense emotional intelligence and empathetic finesse. 

Then came his turn to perform. The stage seemed to loom above him as he struggled to remember his lines and movements. Each word he spoke, every movement he made felt awkward and artificial. He could feel a disconnection between himself and the character he was supposed to portray, the narrative he was to weave. It was in that moment Victor understood that acting wasn’t as easy or as useless as he had originally thought. It was a craft that demanded hard work, dedication, and an ability to immerse oneself in another world. Not everyone had the capacity to master this art form and he held newfound respect for those who could.","291,90,299,1,168,17,100,154,258,269,217,157,108,114,324,311,102,64,330,320,280,336,166,265,85,163,179,56,138,221,152,171,149,321,281,266,170,210,60,95,72,257,276,284,261,12,47,232,27,290,144,19,25,331,93,172,314,208,200,329,303,202,46,254,99,186,141,235,91,150,310,135,40,28,3,184,21,191,31,176,23,238,316,169,33,117,244,98,65,300,118,213,323,293,107,305,38,273,231,252,250,105,192,277,164,195,222,264,220,137,26,237,77,339,0,194,84,162,44,74,224,204,255,8,97,57,7,297,167,110,131,53,51,129,153,283,205,241,160,24,242,119,42,180,2,156,216,270,83,62,199,312,307,298,325,278,41,332,209,126,173,268,219,288,292,296,229,145,71,36,335,151,48,101,285,69,76,230,308,246,218,6,80,134,318,272,35,309,52,20,287,263,282,133,190,182,104,139,262,116","195,78,103,116,106","1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19"
194,To teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer. It needs a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well.,"Margaret had recently graduated with a degree in mathematics, full of knowledge and enthusiasm to share her love for numbers and equations. But when she was offered her first job as a math teacher at a local high school, the realization struck her; to teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer like herself.

Despite the initial nerves, Margaret knew she had to face her fears. She believed in her abilities, but there was a gap between understanding concepts personally and successfully imparting that knowledge onto others. The task required more than just proficiency in her subject. It needed a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well, she realized.

She started preparing with great earnest, rehearsing her lessons multiple times and preparing examples to better explain the more challenging concepts. She constantly read up on new teaching techniques, worked on her communication skills, and tried to anticipate the questions her students might have.

When the big day finally arrived, Margaret was armed with thorough preparation and a heightened sense of responsibility. As she faced her first class, she took a deep breath and started, ""Good morning, everyone. Today we will embark on an exciting journey of numbers and equations."" That day, she took her first step to becoming not just a teacher, but an effective communicator and motivator for her students.","195,138,11,252,47,240,0,302,78,270,277,332,275,290,232,43,224,111,59,164,148,134,146,6,321,264,225,254,100,227,271,92,18,244,5,214,291,55,34,13,38,339,151,246,304,184,300,163,10,335,333,219,86,177,70,206,9,68,161,234,80,260,325,222,228,137,154,19,104,272,282,20,32,126,192,147,307,49,48,131,142,157,21,289,262,323,166,51,211,84,61,73,79,305,278,171,129,279,58,52,93,17,31,120,283,106,189,162,241,107,35,127,45,237,316,182,238,258,266,251,175,226,284,88,160,150,203,220,324,143,130,74,89,191,140,122,53,281,114,72,310,87,136,223,96,235,263,103,334,64,197,245,178,22,183,69,66,187,242,319,198,101,37,329,218,15,75,229,209,128,109,297,274,212,298,176,108,167,338,156,25,185,46,249,174,65,30,24,216,190,256,257,239,287,318,54,193,90,201,250","190,134,75,197,1","9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35"
195,It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.,"Being accepted into the prestigious Hawthorne Institute is not an easy task. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam, a test designed to measure not only the intelligence but the perseverance and determination of the applicants. Not everyone can pass it; every year, out of hundreds of candidates, only a handful of the brightest and most determined scholars make it through.

Take the case of Amelia Jenkins, a determined and passionate student who had her eyes set on the Institute since her early childhood. Day in and day out, she would immerse herself in her studies, foregoing social events and other recreational activities. She understood that casual leisure was a luxury she couldn't afford at the moment. 

Yet, even with such intense determination and unwavering focus, Amelia found herself struggling with some of the complex problems in the entrance exam. She realized that merely studying hard would not guarantee her success; she needed to study smart as well. Adopting new strategies and methods, she started approaching the problems from a different perspective. Eventually, with her relentless effort, she managed to clear the exam, proving that while the task was indeed challenging, it was not impossible. It merely required an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, and a smart approach to problem-solving.","151,44,198,252,131,213,278,181,85,281,204,92,22,40,71,274,306,141,323,27,149,34,320,292,6,134,104,191,118,83,156,48,72,237,178,266,212,39,93,168,268,330,304,80,273,180,282,161,263,8,57,332,339,112,277,221,35,310,220,336,236,143,311,19,59,211,53,222,132,288,163,190,2,78,192,125,145,264,66,29,64,0,169,52,12,201,283,217,127,214,325,15,124,315,238,175,73,294,262,162,171,79,228,96,51,186,267,148,265,317,26,31,209,259,328,197,166,241,9,285,243,272,111,30,91,42,216,261,179,184,144,270,36,77,249,313,302,33,239,230,297,218,229,177,257,49,280,76,187,110,137,251,68,90,115,225,126,321,142,121,271,75,41,1,215,269,135,208,314,255,206,284,165,253,87,24,159,172,293,97,194,100,203,234,286,329,43,55,202,164,333,337,130,193,86,276,250,254,84,61","72,28,75,194,181","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

197,I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.,"Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it.

198,Sam is scared of speaking to strangers but she wants to build up the courage and try it out.,"Sam had always been an introverted girl, shying away from social interactions, particularly with unfamiliar people. For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.","221,26,5,82,290,73,171,197,278,302,117,97,238,209,224,135,126,291,99,214,118,42,12,56,94,226,148,166,33,64,23,227,95,27,253,332,265,191,331,70,180,157,337,150,2,44,142,65,43,194,4,286,32,305,196,19,300,212,54,173,248,280,106,74,304,175,308,257,246,266,156,13,185,115,327,154,322,41,315,241,113,60,131,225,58,145,46,199,72,298,144,189,101,136,276,301,24,91,206,187,289,160,207,314,264,181,326,88,8,16,268,321,211,114,71,15,328,200,239,307,213,260,287,39,125,147,333,247,132,231,69,1,139,68,188,292,284,324,336,124,256,14,205,67,159,22,28,273,37,51,297,329,312,269,228,283,232,258,110,76,237,81,202,138,61,161,111,130,254,30,40,102,18,204,10,244,164,318,133,299,201,170,335,183,93,259,319,153,34,162,109,251,80,104,143,285,63,309,108,62","55,8,88,118,181","5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19"

Whenever the topic of computers or technology came up, he would always wave it off, saying it was too daunting for him. He found the idea of delving into the labyrinth of code to create a functioning computer program particularly intimidating. This avoidance of technology was surprising since Frank was always up for challenges in other areas of his life.

Then, something unusual happened the last time we met. Frank surprised everyone by proclaiming that he was finally ready to conquer his fear of technology. He confidently announced that he would attempt to write his first computer program. The proclamation came out of nowhere, catching everyone, including me, off guard.

We had all gotten used to Frank's refusal to dip his toes in the world of technology, so this sudden shift was undoubtedly unexpected. However, it was also encouraging to see him willing to step out of his comfort zone. Frank's decision marked a new chapter in his life, and we were all eager to see how this turn of events would unfold.","166,57,178,55,198,223,153,263,229,120,137,284,324,304,4,32,29,174,76,73,309,287,267,209,98,106,9,59,246,185,42,331,44,319,146,213,179,66,176,128,291,328,109,256,130,188,334,313,24,295,290,96,196,170,46,107,194,131,132,318,222,108,272,260,133,310,162,189,51,175,69,64,207,77,184,212,236,235,67,160,54,312,247,92,283,220,47,259,271,110,224,13,45,43,113,3,16,215,86,323,155,180,126,320,52,7,252,327,149,168,219,71,237,72,183,316,1,239,329,123,264,165,53,91,302,90,230,40,84,19,251,100,31,301,20,58,173,63,68,307,61,41,276,135,125,27,191,280,152,139,206,18,129,10,48,281,8,35,124,286,22,201,34,159,60,14,216,81,245,195,317,238,242,244,2,158,102,15,262,177,200,253,275,181,56,104,80,226,88,278,197,122,50,325,134,150,39,228,211,167","53,191,5,181,162",200
200,"My sister cannot sleep in a dark room due to her fears, but she wants to challenge herself someday.","My sister, Emily, has a deeply ingrained fear of the dark that traces back to our childhood. As children, we would share ghost stories late at night, and Emily would always end up shaken, her imagination running wild. She was so petrified that she always left the hallway light on before going to sleep, casting a faint glow into her room. It was her way of dealing with the fear of what lurked in the darkness. 

But as we grew older, Emily decided that she could no longer allow her fear to dictate her life. She often spoke of her desire to one day sleep in a completely dark room, without the safety of the light from the hallway. It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.","240,308,291,274,309,46,271,2,305,116,166,230,54,143,189,318,123,66,328,23,329,270,253,267,211,192,175,228,244,90,93,210,70,207,281,19,180,227,32,176,6,94,311,139,215,86,35,277,272,45,155,286,41,0,273,217,138,60,226,84,278,78,16,145,81,61,48,15,164,248,51,170,136,39,68,40,106,18,288,307,5,168,174,335,115,71,142,134,198,205,74,67,69,191,4,219,190,119,102,104,37,112,82,304,89,156,140,144,213,108,172,303,187,237,12,55,324,188,298,212,283,8,231,44,120,38,316,252,266,268,331,196,118,249,97,275,149,129,20,320,130,183,33,263,294,50,21,290,337,62,223,336,58,246,53,65,201,121,186,182,284,117,302,80,133,202,122,247,25,330,333,306,280,197,229,131,279,43,184,258,109,127,179,199,239,321,147,323,285,225,125,7,26,141,287,124,14,157,107,11","132,174,89,184,157","1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19"

Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears.

The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.","170,158,43,151,163,205,52,278,218,148,119,305,67,190,219,318,153,242,330,149,236,241,244,51,45,225,169,275,71,337,251,173,41,22,227,176,86,64,166,319,172,207,223,283,31,245,298,309,118,194,215,122,235,198,253,282,77,233,195,99,182,334,258,84,297,265,288,273,213,88,312,261,201,28,126,143,33,326,127,117,80,300,270,1,210,75,104,252,140,61,14,313,105,290,250,130,132,247,141,106,209,196,168,37,203,268,56,260,23,27,29,189,144,226,229,133,254,54,65,238,240,114,11,155,259,208,69,228,159,322,42,317,217,107,60,310,102,16,150,17,5,231,15,262,131,36,98,48,314,44,320,200,171,255,8,266,211,112,62,3,30,20,136,280,214,221,142,50,109,73,279,100,181,271,306,83,24,243,311,145,204,324,293,263,287,108,125,116,152,49,328,188,246,264,239,294,124,191,179,302","126,101,85,157,69","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
213,Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.,"Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.","66,62,54,167,31,22,206,325,264,63,272,37,13,28,222,334,114,108,90,204,328,281,0,47,121,99,256,304,162,85,230,42,172,40,307,259,19,6,235,9,10,84,298,263,208,314,8,280,70,7,247,151,88,323,139,291,35,116,316,183,32,202,200,284,123,97,248,320,101,86,302,153,134,161,232,21,18,46,59,209,173,146,65,258,136,195,55,214,170,265,5,262,2,196,299,94,128,339,44,15,77,260,29,289,122,303,294,253,215,68,30,156,176,207,169,210,39,186,118,43,74,297,244,197,100,58,164,257,3,216,212,271,268,177,27,71,180,110,237,245,130,26,317,221,227,124,338,17,78,203,228,131,313,135,211,141,45,89,188,152,239,50,165,80,315,119,218,269,171,300,115,336,154,335,290,92,217,166,112,309,293,251,305,145,158,234,174,282,276,64,34,25,182,254,329,238,306,49,311,147","45,80,116,155,131","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

One day, his colleagues decided to test just how dedicated he was to his habit, so they began a debate over the color of the paperclips they used in the office.

John immediately entered into a fierce argument, insisting that red paperclips were superior in every way. His colleagues watched in bemusement as he railed on about the psychology of color and how red represented power and determination. Meanwhile, an important deadline was looming and work was piling up around them. They tried to refocus John's attention on the mounting tasks but to no avail.

For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.","84,288,54,279,96,130,234,78,5,4,112,69,1,284,141,154,330,139,110,293,217,81,324,203,109,27,191,32,248,239,296,266,201,9,297,331,323,171,3,178,325,228,244,182,337,165,249,107,310,18,62,17,272,202,76,12,108,212,126,247,206,149,40,246,254,195,114,10,117,106,124,231,120,39,33,36,300,338,227,90,233,169,267,100,51,166,98,223,257,301,335,22,111,226,43,155,66,175,313,73,189,306,192,283,113,145,250,270,286,159,256,243,116,82,184,219,251,210,26,16,320,222,119,294,35,136,336,241,41,38,237,242,20,23,137,225,308,280,53,85,235,158,224,204,75,164,83,89,91,162,183,37,55,319,135,97,299,314,262,261,229,103,263,173,140,264,99,143,31,21,218,211,125,15,157,64,186,77,333,131,138,281,94,216,271,285,214,332,230,188,278,122,207,213,221,172,86,134,258,42","187,184,21,171,116","1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27"

We bought this old, dilapidated house on the countryside with the intention of renovating it completely. It was a huge project that required the utmost attention to every room, every nook and cranny. Despite the enormity of the task, his attention was bizarrely drawn to one particular doorknob.

This was not an ordinary doorknob, but an antique, rusted one which was hanging onto the main entrance door of our project house.

It confounds me how he can lose himself in the intricacies of the tarnished brass detail while ignoring the bigger tasks at hand. 

Rooms needed painting, floorboards needed replacing, and the roof definitely needed some serious work. Yet here was Ralph, consumed with researching how to restore a singular, century-old doorknob. It was a testament to his tendency to get lost in the minute details and lose sight of the larger goal, a flaw that could potentially derail our entire renovation plan.","131,302,133,6,164,174,282,205,70,190,82,175,212,186,217,265,332,18,80,110,236,238,237,34,64,195,258,292,41,227,167,276,305,318,123,58,324,253,128,15,268,126,68,76,57,21,171,23,271,273,327,101,170,25,290,93,94,104,189,12,36,55,256,52,125,141,310,38,202,45,113,334,297,204,20,17,182,148,284,319,283,316,219,209,183,27,320,242,315,301,277,33,74,146,180,285,106,228,323,293,213,230,336,286,295,0,247,224,331,102,257,35,272,121,111,223,49,137,53,43,54,98,7,19,267,234,117,259,88,85,66,4,181,69,296,51,198,77,99,150,214,211,149,222,191,47,201,329,312,166,206,9,162,83,322,307,65,294,177,129,143,140,330,109,199,239,178,279,75,108,136,78,28,218,37,269,248,144,138,50,61,59,275,246,84,142,139,120,44,185,29,46,255,97,207,311,165,338,250,215","141,200,15,174,83","7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70"

220,"Listen to the news straight from the horse’s mouth, his factory burned down right in front of his eyes.","Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack, a highly esteemed entrepreneur in town. He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.","216,108,188,272,185,123,177,178,190,154,303,126,5,289,128,37,208,267,318,10,146,275,57,121,314,122,62,254,203,212,329,15,132,244,331,330,227,76,12,176,140,65,74,234,251,133,215,119,100,136,125,113,35,23,103,252,242,204,296,339,106,0,214,124,263,266,202,281,129,198,231,207,241,300,130,223,238,54,156,264,114,59,30,311,205,158,80,201,277,257,118,199,159,2,209,147,192,283,309,9,116,305,75,166,221,31,175,79,109,3,148,52,315,173,258,308,127,71,42,282,131,325,144,338,155,182,294,332,217,83,225,183,312,295,184,60,232,101,16,261,255,302,200,235,117,256,206,64,145,334,211,326,139,284,134,104,102,142,243,317,160,336,112,298,186,279,191,68,168,39,67,218,152,222,135,333,6,82,162,224,41,161,240,246,290,110,53,38,34,230,164,50,151,1,137,226,291,179,95,280","105,174,76,180,131","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

The word that stood out was 'pioneer'. The lecture was going to be delivered by none other than Professor John Abrams, the renowned pioneer in the field of quantum astronomy.

I couldn't believe my luck; Abrams was a living legend! His theories had radically changed the way humanity perceived the universe and our place within it. The chance to listen to him speaking on his most recent research was something I couldn't pass up, and I knew I wanted to attend the lecture.

The thought of him explaining his concepts, straight from his perspective, was thrilling. His insights, his deductions and the way he connected dots across the universe were incredibly unique. I imagined how enriched I would feel after listening to his wisdom, deciphering the universe through his lens.

226,This shopkeeper always palms off old stock to the customers.,"In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

The town's elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, regularly visited his store for their weekly groceries. They were often the victims of his ploys, ending up with half-rotten tomatoes and stale bread more often than not. But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business.

227,She tried to hand over the hardest part of the assignment on me so she doesn't have to do it.,"I had always known Miranda to be a crafty girl, but it wasn't until we were paired up for a history project that I saw just how sneaky she could be. The project was to create a detailed timeline on the events of the Revolutionary War, clearly not an easy task. We agreed to share the work equally, to make the workload lighter for both of us. However, I soon noticed Miranda's work ethic didn't quite match mine.

One day, while we were brainstorming in the library, Miranda suggested we divide the tasks. To my surprise, she offered to take over the easy part, compiling the list of dates and events. She then suggested I take up the responsibility of researching each event in depth, crafting detailed descriptions, and designing the physical timeline; the hardest part of the assignment.

Miranda said it so sweetly, with a harmless smile and an innocent tilt of her head. But I immediately saw through her. She was trying to hand over the hardest part of the assignment to me so she doesn't have to do it. Realizing her cunning intentions, I decided to negotiate the division of tasks more fairly, refusing to let her escape her fair share of the work.","217,338,228,183,197,240,266,114,72,288,289,212,242,135,285,24,143,178,9,189,149,165,35,283,306,158,102,85,37,146,162,145,113,167,120,247,245,270,171,333,238,174,265,209,86,4,190,188,318,201,129,311,191,321,0,14,58,98,241,278,119,51,154,23,307,78,291,30,140,100,67,326,48,193,230,63,269,170,308,194,69,15,239,76,57,332,233,41,169,325,106,10,157,250,300,38,141,122,229,203,152,103,336,96,268,290,40,287,231,335,232,131,8,218,281,207,90,327,73,159,275,127,320,310,95,334,235,182,274,200,32,150,330,213,175,331,286,225,226,172,282,49,298,126,80,52,216,55,328,94,224,257,71,54,208,25,221,92,115,252,258,28,211,123,329,117,303,339,68,105,65,198,262,124,17,139,234,176,273,91,319,19,173,271,56,7,1,3,46,109,177,223,251,313,248,26,315,83,136,74","139,3,99,75,109","1, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 24, 33"

These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.","133,317,148,221,127,151,281,229,183,80,22,65,247,240,167,79,115,321,5,270,232,45,329,235,283,330,139,78,175,49,89,83,311,239,282,43,38,230,300,225,37,323,138,231,52,202,245,181,263,159,122,207,123,128,76,255,218,279,219,313,325,135,95,315,256,59,217,32,312,44,272,100,85,142,189,335,275,293,286,220,173,146,73,226,6,301,233,197,40,31,86,8,192,187,309,298,105,77,106,62,64,250,119,68,285,210,152,324,97,39,103,29,165,266,252,82,277,268,184,111,297,259,290,273,19,10,215,131,112,156,316,118,203,161,223,55,74,195,287,130,278,302,253,180,201,258,284,265,211,132,92,120,334,4,337,47,104,33,48,107,66,271,227,117,169,144,251,328,213,69,257,109,168,327,147,99,179,93,149,14,243,70,102,291,332,16,304,170,333,200,318,110,7,63,254,299,88,310,116,134","84,163,8,38,44","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
229,Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.,"Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.","250,24,159,264,207,200,7,177,338,61,226,327,129,172,227,188,125,281,270,150,170,120,23,163,126,257,334,260,82,134,92,332,62,266,314,280,251,213,102,19,57,65,190,182,293,149,320,22,173,171,75,197,231,165,176,244,43,66,8,49,228,55,157,234,107,58,255,135,28,34,117,94,299,282,138,97,296,330,193,27,290,287,5,205,309,128,54,30,103,206,115,106,245,298,225,67,101,29,239,86,179,204,84,331,185,196,21,214,144,155,162,339,220,242,93,316,305,292,321,47,111,72,143,3,33,248,285,230,99,85,289,160,105,308,317,274,318,26,53,279,142,186,51,119,73,295,131,52,224,247,17,256,78,211,312,81,184,265,154,195,12,88,240,325,278,297,148,315,183,199,161,208,130,38,291,263,310,122,262,14,20,187,139,243,31,288,98,166,91,313,335,90,15,137,140,2,156,267,253,124","11,15,61,128,53","1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25"
230,The music producer selects a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client.,"In the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, Dan Murphy, a renowned music producer, was hard at work in his state-of-the-art recording studio. Amid the collection of records, tracks, and albums strewn about his desk, one particular task was causing him more distress than any other. It involved his least favorite client, a pompous pop star named Jimmy Sparkle who had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way.

Dan sifted through his vast collection of yet-to-be-released songs, attempting to find one suitable for his demanding client. He chuckled cynically, deciding to choose a tune that wasn't well-received in initial listening sessions. It was a less liked song, one that was penned for an indie artist but somehow didn't make the cut. He remembered the honest lyrics and quirky melody that was met with mixed responses - not all songs can please everyone, he thought.

Feeling a twisted satisfaction, Dan selected the track for Jimmy, the epitome of mainstream pop, a stark contrast to the spirit of the song. He burned the track onto a CD, the words 'New Single - Jimmy Sparkle' etched into it, then packed it away to send to the insufferable pop star. Perhaps, he thought, this could be an awakening for Jimmy, an opportunity for him to make something meaningful instead of his usual cookie-cutter pop. Or perhaps, it would be a disastrous mismatch that would humble him, either way, Dan felt it was a win-win situation for himself.","101,281,205,34,21,196,269,129,22,1,128,328,236,132,136,5,215,203,45,140,323,318,52,338,10,306,297,100,32,86,88,124,90,197,139,209,9,98,257,131,137,336,113,261,108,167,309,6,302,293,240,232,254,337,320,278,117,60,172,3,153,174,99,221,265,298,334,314,295,141,64,229,256,220,148,312,151,30,23,77,11,50,14,191,12,204,154,27,180,322,81,46,335,15,103,185,24,31,279,285,56,94,258,17,283,244,55,313,226,264,193,118,48,133,91,73,329,184,142,114,72,127,339,301,156,316,266,49,150,85,78,195,231,79,270,121,4,182,111,178,155,317,253,40,37,165,80,307,152,176,66,160,217,332,308,107,216,235,219,43,162,272,125,84,315,304,62,227,326,210,241,249,234,294,130,120,168,201,170,135,218,290,164,228,300,173,289,89,54,186,33,58,198,275,188,61,189,159,26,158","109,168,184,72,133","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He was used to a clientele that was more daring in their culinary tastes, always willing to try something new and exciting. Today, however, he found himself serving a less adventurous customer, someone who had no particular desire to explore the exotic and unusual dishes that were Chef Marco's specialty. He had no wish to force his culinary philosophy on anyone who was not willing to accept it.

With a sigh, Chef Marco took a step back, consulting his list of simpler recipes reserved for such instances. His eyes quickly scanned over the list, finally settling on the perfect dish - a classic beef stew with roasted vegetables, a comforting dish that was sure to satisfy. His hands started to move with an assured fluidity, expertly cutting the beef and vegetables into equal sizes, then browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables. 

He simmered everything in a robust broth, letting the aroma fill his kitchen. He knew this dish was a world away from his typical experimental recipes, but he also knew that sometimes, simplicity has its own charm. As he served the customer, he did so with the same level of pride, knowing that even with less adventurous dishes, his skills as a chef could still shine.","183,25,36,102,261,30,99,85,151,230,54,118,229,12,300,101,50,78,251,225,262,86,250,330,176,156,267,323,189,223,100,121,133,137,26,203,178,140,161,68,76,7,15,136,80,53,63,338,20,290,144,43,124,131,145,167,40,60,162,236,150,295,322,8,193,113,5,9,331,233,320,179,159,337,212,6,172,81,38,293,175,114,327,164,228,109,171,130,79,35,28,265,77,321,328,155,127,303,107,237,207,181,32,96,302,117,239,119,252,89,45,264,273,90,84,174,47,285,112,74,192,115,42,314,82,111,197,297,182,304,270,215,116,170,184,44,134,279,268,332,141,202,138,70,110,13,210,263,246,22,226,157,325,188,23,61,75,56,39,272,214,195,315,318,64,217,185,29,3,186,143,276,147,88,122,284,14,326,168,95,98,191,200,227,55,94,205,177,59,219,244,129,152,69,204,257,57,298,287,324","151,184,85,13,10","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

This was a tradition established long ago during our university days. Tom was the president of the student council, responsible for organizing most of the major events on campus. He had a unique method for ensuring each event's success, isolating himself from the rest of us to focus completely.

Before every major event, Tom would retreat into solitude for days at a time. He would sit in his room, surrounded by piles of papers, charts, and notes, tirelessly working to iron out the minutest details of the event. Every element of the event, from the decor to the itinerary, was meticulously planned by him.

241,Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.,"Philip was notorious for his clever excuses and sly tricks to dodge chores. His parents, especially his mother, were growing weary of this routine. The time had come when Philip had to understand the importance of work, no matter how trivial it seemed. One day, Philip adopted his tried and tested method of avoiding chores again. He started pretending to be immensely busy with his schoolwork. He was hoping this tactic would continue to serve him as it always had.

But his mother, observing him closely, started to sense that something was not right. After a little investigation, she found out he had no pending work from school. Seeing his lack of sincerity, his mother decided to teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget. She commanded Philip to take over the chores not just for that day, but for the entire week, forcing him to step into the reality of responsibility.","93,216,210,313,9,338,238,318,295,182,250,296,312,203,335,172,283,136,91,94,242,158,128,171,227,63,309,7,117,253,260,127,284,287,279,31,263,230,278,39,101,185,237,276,30,132,195,25,120,95,187,34,149,70,248,206,190,99,275,231,65,224,334,118,151,302,298,213,316,181,257,84,232,204,305,199,314,100,317,164,331,42,179,202,28,73,5,200,20,207,258,57,115,244,254,168,188,87,13,163,292,294,299,97,44,53,105,123,240,184,140,194,134,180,12,64,29,47,211,148,209,212,332,49,59,304,125,252,155,339,192,133,106,280,268,126,74,162,58,144,245,92,75,153,56,69,321,221,108,175,293,137,61,173,246,160,178,229,33,71,130,301,201,328,259,103,320,38,310,4,303,169,46,170,281,214,269,333,82,189,239,67,146,48,68,274,262,197,223,297,233,85,243,272,79,325,43,271,114,27","7,181,109,21,193","7, 17, 21, 25, 41, 43, 47, 67, 77, 87"

Two weeks before the presentation, one member of the team, Jason, received news that his grandmother was critically ill. Despite his personal issues, Jason continued to contribute to the project to the best of his abilities. To ease Jason's stress, the group decided to concoct a small lie, stating that Jason was out of town visiting ailing relatives. They hoped this would exempt them from the presentation, allowing them to simply turn in the paper instead.

On the day of the meeting, one of the group members casually informed their professor, Dr. Sanders, about Jason's unexpected absence. However, Dr. Sanders, with his years of experience and knack for reading his students, discerned the fib. Coincidentally, he had seen Jason at the library earlier that day, working on the project. With the truth in sight, Dr. Sanders decided not to confront the group about their deception. Instead, he made the choice to deduct marks on their project, teaching them a valuable lesson about honesty and integrity in academia.","102,1,149,54,12,179,5,323,34,222,264,30,78,161,176,24,169,191,25,259,181,173,307,106,75,107,331,277,148,206,117,126,121,133,85,16,204,143,82,39,182,196,116,239,135,185,248,290,205,211,13,2,244,59,109,255,212,294,110,168,223,92,260,104,333,36,144,163,65,216,7,23,319,322,313,60,246,132,108,131,150,137,18,203,310,127,123,276,48,177,297,321,159,114,128,164,272,337,125,188,26,281,312,51,261,300,237,178,33,31,292,184,154,38,166,316,250,326,257,72,96,145,271,68,201,47,229,87,152,287,238,258,156,225,302,183,243,57,140,129,42,308,256,84,224,142,119,53,165,194,122,278,19,56,46,157,172,174,192,249,193,295,231,240,197,138,207,17,101,288,254,202,15,334,267,198,235,67,221,100,336,270,328,43,175,317,318,241,27,291,228,338,186,324,79,95,111,279,262,299","131,44,164,188,137","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13"

However, her professor, a seasoned educator with years of experience, was not convinced. He looked at her through his spectacles and decided to penalize her for not only failing to submit the work on time, but also for attempting to deceive him.

Peter watched his wife with a soft smile, her excitement was infectious and normally he'd be just as enthusiastic.

Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.","134,163,151,131,116,53,281,23,295,101,49,62,5,138,0,229,14,279,270,61,128,155,11,269,282,250,67,115,263,159,280,143,145,81,162,265,41,44,182,157,207,35,18,220,38,153,322,243,56,88,261,206,224,330,336,186,135,136,29,164,69,17,47,178,104,60,189,204,46,132,42,79,146,22,219,188,161,247,121,93,254,313,66,100,83,246,144,249,150,120,99,105,227,25,191,335,244,139,19,276,232,30,187,40,262,43,166,339,112,65,289,274,235,97,140,286,110,92,57,302,259,197,12,251,165,240,236,137,4,283,91,87,267,221,248,304,167,7,59,258,223,237,314,241,20,217,310,183,253,209,185,58,94,305,107,196,338,273,48,122,194,85,15,90,64,293,266,89,102,129,71,213,82,210,50,127,173,271,169,98,331,126,9,96,211,332,130,152,216,133,242,218,285,298,315,198,149,177,201,31","97,86,78,135,88","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

248,The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees.,"Peachwood Technologies, a mid-sized tech firm, had always boasted about its stable financial standing. However, this year had been turbulent and the company had taken a considerable financial hit due to unforeseen market conditions. As a result, the board was faced with a difficult decision when it came to the annual holiday bonus for its employees. 

The CEO, Martha, called for a company-wide virtual meeting to deliver the sobering news. In her heartfelt speech, she announced that the company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. She explained that the decision was a tough one and was taken only after exhausting all other cost-cutting alternatives. The announcement was met with disappointment, but Martha's honesty and transparency also earned her the respect of her employees. 

To soften the blow, Martha promised that the company would make up for the loss as soon as the financial situation improved. Despite the news, the employees took it in stride, understanding the difficulties faced by the company in these challenging times. The incident, although unfortunate, created a deeper bond among the employees and reinforced their commitment to the company.","145,243,254,155,162,312,13,213,245,120,246,177,194,327,311,33,333,278,84,280,238,210,339,170,68,255,174,198,221,59,20,332,247,189,153,244,242,295,58,44,300,183,190,192,305,229,219,9,326,214,142,23,272,36,83,69,96,290,212,140,293,273,6,38,270,321,199,315,232,186,74,18,286,149,98,105,165,34,47,279,26,146,335,187,0,70,289,205,302,40,207,182,95,29,66,336,329,271,136,27,32,61,5,287,331,249,11,256,200,236,299,64,227,196,104,25,310,151,8,158,141,99,275,288,252,328,172,62,281,49,274,76,135,87,259,112,297,330,250,115,188,208,166,231,2,72,201,216,117,10,282,222,116,313,296,157,338,132,181,79,215,102,139,31,94,191,131,193,39,147,103,85,53,17,266,15,206,133,258,100,168,318,3,42,138,334,24,57,203,237,235,197,45,320,264,19,303,152,304,225","36,9,11,33,106","1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15"

Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent.

His eyes were wide and filled with fear as he focused his gaze on the towering figure before him. 

""Do you know who you're facing?"" the young man's coach hastily whispered from the sidelines, panic coursing through his veins. He pointed a shaky finger at the person towering over his student. ""That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!"" His voice was filled with a mix of awe and fear, as he gave a sidelong glance to his student.

The young man's heart pounded fiercely in his chest but he stood his ground, now aware of the gravity of the situation. The world champion or not, he was not going to back down without a fight. His mentor's warning words echoed in his head as he walked forward, stepping into the spotlight to face the world champion, prepared to give his all, to fight the greatest battle of his life.","163,9,53,136,215,83,147,168,311,245,295,252,222,268,256,198,210,220,314,196,38,339,302,160,254,273,177,233,249,115,138,105,332,134,120,33,321,25,318,91,267,250,328,207,279,165,162,31,304,175,16,197,2,113,140,121,117,68,200,201,97,289,19,307,258,241,287,170,144,111,291,299,59,226,224,47,317,42,229,55,26,282,271,234,253,141,85,290,239,308,243,185,202,10,238,337,334,96,212,8,145,82,178,109,90,320,45,313,69,3,232,149,78,4,142,139,79,330,297,266,100,248,272,128,24,154,240,324,278,62,93,164,205,264,300,56,107,18,108,39,219,14,0,40,206,277,41,265,269,116,173,30,6,21,17,29,221,46,199,193,309,217,263,95,259,37,281,127,329,35,106,50,228,285,326,172,305,167,303,180,34,211,63,129,148,143,70,274,98,184,5,80,323,125,260,225,251,182,132,65","42,197,12,85,25","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

From the moment they started dating, Rebecca sensed Mark was a complex puzzle; a man with secrets. She would catch him in small lies, minor details that didn't add up, contradictions in his past experiences, and the most alarming of all, his conveniently forgotten promises. Her instinct was screaming that he was lying to her, but Rebecca was conflicted.

Despite all of it, Rebecca loved Mark; he was sweet, caring, and made her feel cherished. Though she was aware of her boyfriend's deception, she decided to turn a blind eye.

He knew he had a reputation as a strict professor, but he also prided himself on being fair and understanding.

One particular sentence kept reappearing in the assignments, word for word. It was an obscure quote from a lesser-known scientist that he mentioned briefly in one of his lectures. He recognized this as a sign that the majority of students had collaborated in doing their homework.

The normal procedure would be to report the incident to the academic integrity board of the university, but Professor Johnson decided against it. He felt that it was an indication that the students were under intense pressure and perhaps they needed to be encouraged rather than punished.

Instead of penalizing the students, he decided to use the situation as a teaching moment. The next day, he brought up the copied sentence in class, discussed the ethics and implications of plagiarism, and gave the students an opportunity to redo the assignment. While he wished to maintain academic integrity, he also understood that everyone deserved a second chance.","8,109,286,339,178,233,312,37,47,136,223,261,22,64,290,171,217,225,228,186,105,165,184,166,177,97,40,130,39,326,243,256,221,74,29,115,78,85,160,230,12,182,59,147,163,236,6,335,14,294,192,258,319,275,83,194,235,282,138,129,84,211,204,218,89,150,140,170,169,244,185,310,181,143,65,325,167,108,124,38,304,137,203,51,198,195,193,330,238,234,122,146,327,187,162,309,183,21,328,188,227,9,253,263,53,111,274,240,90,305,0,161,31,48,248,120,149,88,336,70,114,329,121,142,301,106,268,302,113,119,56,141,107,117,237,296,299,116,257,54,131,273,314,15,322,75,60,19,231,232,199,96,55,104,272,285,94,249,190,306,25,151,324,210,45,175,331,271,281,292,27,259,93,110,7,92,159,318,321,66,26,28,317,334,191,316,265,118,68,102,71,123,280,254,262,100,174,5,212,291","32,139,52,172,12","6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18"

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation.

262,"She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","Alena was a quiet and introverted girl in her senior year of high school. She was consistently seen in the library or the laboratory, completely immersed in her books. She was never a part of the overly flamboyant crowd, the ones who enjoyed boasting about their intelligence, their latest scores, and achievements. In contrast to them, Alena had a calm, poised demeanor.

People often underestimated her due to her unassuming personality. Even her teachers were unaware of the prodigy that hid beneath her humble exterior. Her friends, however, knew about her dedication, about the late-night study sessions and countless revisions she put into her preparation for the board exams.

The result day arrived, and everyone held their breath in anticipation. The school's top rank was taken by the usual, boastful scholar. However, when Alena's name was announced for the second position, the hall echoed with surprise and admiration. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams.

263,"He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.","Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.","77,291,339,32,273,318,194,97,226,89,82,294,102,118,274,139,163,168,271,229,15,103,220,14,326,90,100,101,64,154,87,204,138,297,310,307,71,75,6,95,282,195,259,175,225,293,203,266,27,287,171,10,210,91,164,265,243,209,137,66,162,143,5,331,315,199,31,78,240,2,190,176,50,46,18,51,120,38,262,182,81,147,169,281,23,284,313,157,125,119,192,249,267,174,84,96,106,170,275,20,37,33,205,60,148,227,85,11,146,230,149,124,298,56,160,335,127,130,239,30,304,80,48,22,45,277,301,29,107,185,115,47,12,322,252,57,214,206,268,237,26,0,134,40,44,111,144,55,136,108,93,53,261,65,264,217,17,152,61,128,222,213,311,123,338,314,238,269,178,290,159,140,35,316,186,296,13,224,4,109,177,250,201,295,260,183,41,70,161,145,306,165,332,228,328,245,208,112,167,303","79,155,56,48,93","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
264,She posted a lot about her friendship with Mary on Instagram. But in reality they hardly had any bond as they were constantly on their phones when together.,"Once a darling of social media, Cynthia was known for her vivacious pictures and exciting updates. She always had a knack for creating a fascinating virtual life, which drew thousands of followers. One of the most prominent features of her Instagram was her seemingly unshakeable friendship with Mary. Their matching outfits, their Friday night pizza outings, and the signature duo selfies, all painted the perfect image of a loyal bond.

However, the true scenario was a striking contrast to the vibrant pictures posted online. In reality, Cynthia and Mary shared an utterly superficial bond. Their meet-ups were mostly marked by silence, interrupted only by the constant clicking of their phone cameras. Instead of making genuine conversations, they were more involved with capturing the best moments for their Instagram.

Their shared love for social media had somehow eclipsed the need for forming a real bond. Both had fallen prey to the attraction of the digital world, swapping meaningful friendship for a fake image. It was the irony of their bond - known as best friends online, but strangers when the screens were put away.","141,263,202,292,192,217,0,286,50,258,154,12,13,334,160,223,107,112,91,74,147,177,206,73,296,321,336,184,295,51,83,234,204,236,302,130,182,135,167,39,164,189,186,339,272,62,174,76,97,219,269,131,298,268,20,230,317,87,42,94,89,96,306,240,191,275,214,7,86,101,294,144,265,175,319,328,181,134,85,82,63,327,281,225,34,338,79,326,65,114,185,104,238,221,273,285,41,29,56,308,40,162,161,172,99,117,193,267,1,205,153,190,168,250,25,15,9,245,307,158,140,207,8,57,266,32,5,139,165,276,293,262,120,126,17,88,208,309,290,200,173,28,243,247,211,226,61,37,253,119,123,171,31,176,111,103,169,30,3,108,242,256,303,310,59,257,90,127,235,27,55,222,166,237,14,132,170,11,72,197,329,324,335,145,22,163,78,246,325,46,53,282,71,66,331,93,23,156,216,318","132,2,73,125,108","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.","318,264,212,167,116,158,112,4,180,191,71,54,283,235,150,78,286,273,74,142,339,119,170,84,195,218,70,250,172,257,178,249,219,37,239,222,313,206,137,133,253,26,231,128,96,312,53,81,109,177,317,216,266,333,316,59,111,267,227,169,45,102,123,274,44,162,295,155,5,234,259,147,7,171,122,263,232,146,203,332,23,124,100,118,62,223,300,293,306,85,213,164,58,108,0,320,34,126,188,98,311,290,103,125,33,190,314,86,151,255,43,153,245,331,17,97,56,131,297,66,247,39,11,60,302,92,163,276,135,141,51,187,193,95,301,214,120,288,132,330,179,80,149,18,139,89,47,165,77,327,82,329,294,226,269,303,315,144,209,30,198,79,262,197,73,325,69,1,251,244,75,319,270,115,29,229,207,160,194,136,90,230,252,64,27,240,9,256,254,83,175,292,140,184,324,243,105,221,68,114","163,76,2,53,58","3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 16, 17, 33, 34, 36"
266,Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.,"Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.","143,285,7,56,37,221,297,27,134,86,156,277,175,236,13,167,163,310,260,268,235,292,205,68,133,238,11,269,218,98,259,91,96,136,276,226,3,262,158,53,49,92,110,74,172,240,320,241,194,45,281,113,71,78,63,6,212,178,282,230,250,326,287,324,176,17,333,129,318,211,193,290,36,147,329,83,19,159,267,265,88,82,137,89,264,119,202,162,142,65,24,337,249,334,243,275,106,109,309,328,121,15,245,141,335,196,2,117,149,247,201,103,42,220,187,12,253,207,124,69,43,181,66,286,127,224,57,206,166,278,161,313,338,120,168,188,231,18,254,25,108,111,323,331,298,173,304,55,81,228,210,164,288,145,0,222,177,165,257,130,102,339,258,216,307,139,261,190,104,138,171,283,101,22,189,125,128,306,77,225,51,237,321,169,244,208,314,76,34,67,41,154,308,263,213,118,170,256,279,94","38,194,85,80,79","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
267,Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents.,"Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.","25,212,244,182,91,14,276,11,46,95,42,263,56,120,61,114,23,310,163,302,242,193,159,233,117,166,118,260,262,160,143,22,306,317,39,10,232,93,181,71,225,32,107,90,265,199,229,69,12,204,313,250,318,174,195,155,290,272,297,18,156,176,314,311,324,319,203,58,188,130,198,273,83,221,288,251,105,248,48,285,219,320,158,295,309,231,106,26,150,54,101,1,35,243,67,165,97,122,315,74,210,322,179,7,108,80,157,164,296,17,184,300,38,264,55,146,289,43,298,142,291,70,86,99,282,228,102,274,254,316,206,304,126,189,266,208,216,134,68,252,186,60,284,33,190,63,131,236,258,307,16,53,75,129,278,261,222,227,13,256,220,78,338,144,303,255,65,173,9,287,294,196,247,257,88,96,175,51,336,145,279,325,153,177,183,331,275,172,89,249,19,84,21,335,136,305,209,253,20,192","29,12,114,45,135","3, 4, 5, 9, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25"
268,A forest grew near the river.,"Once upon a time, in a peaceful little valley, a thick forest grew near the meandering river. This was no ordinary forest; it was an enchanting mix of towering pines, emerald oaks, and myriad colorful wildflowers that danced in the wind. The river, a sparkling ribbon of blue, wound its way lazily through the forest, nourishing it with its life-giving water. Each morning, a shimmering mist would rise from the river and blanket the forest in a gentle, silvery haze.

Wildlife thrived in the forest, making the environment even more vibrant. Deer moved elegantly amongst the trees while the birds filled the air with their melodious songs. As night fell, the nocturnal creatures took over, filling the forest with their whispered conversations and soft scurrying. 

Just beyond the river, a small, picturesque village lay, inhabited by people who revered the forest and considered it a sacred entity. The villagers would often come to the river's edge to collect water, fish or simply marvel at the forest's tranquil beauty. Thus, life existed harmoniously in the quaint valley where the magical forest grew near the river.","78,144,167,107,171,166,241,176,309,6,175,301,84,137,277,272,105,269,1,136,160,220,96,231,69,119,226,280,91,170,143,195,70,18,285,317,331,24,36,35,282,304,85,324,291,172,329,295,40,327,315,252,287,292,214,284,128,335,302,273,185,221,261,133,73,43,44,100,59,245,157,11,21,179,98,188,219,47,97,10,182,8,41,75,198,174,127,51,227,64,223,129,242,55,149,16,151,139,4,311,187,86,3,234,251,138,25,54,267,289,61,52,236,192,257,217,200,212,82,79,14,339,206,263,2,325,321,194,30,141,271,109,74,191,237,15,71,153,5,88,248,270,275,330,255,208,193,116,117,95,89,155,306,154,290,216,161,94,68,232,190,283,256,177,180,233,274,19,239,39,307,203,106,49,163,305,123,156,333,310,7,222,318,103,278,264,204,0,243,338,158,110,125,238,299,183,228,31,132,147","18,142,131,16,60","1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18"
269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"In the quaint village of Anandpur nestled in the Himalayas, there lived a wise guru named Raghavendra. He was a renowned scholar, known far and wide for his wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual guidance. Word spread about Raghavendra's teachings and soon, students from all over the country began arriving to learn from him. Many students came to study under the guru, looking to gain enlightenment and pursue wisdom.

Among those students was a humble boy named Rohit, who had walked for days from his distant village to reach Anandpur. A thirst for knowledge had driven Rohit to undertake this journey. His village's elders had spoken highly of Raghavendra, painting him as a beacon of wisdom. Intrigued and eager, Rohit was one of the many who sought Raghavendra's tutelage.

These students, including Rohit, would sit attentively around Raghavendra, captivated by his teachings and stories. As they absorbed his wisdom, they started to comprehend the complexities of life. Despite hailing from different walks of life, the students formed a cohesive bond under Raghavendra's stewardship, embarking on a shared journey of spiritual and intellectual growth.","236,30,207,115,117,327,197,137,179,97,222,249,149,244,77,321,7,218,281,178,275,63,148,271,241,272,173,333,101,313,298,337,20,330,49,166,262,38,103,107,157,213,242,124,278,274,36,167,54,75,174,169,288,314,293,158,316,183,21,138,64,182,256,306,184,132,246,91,216,286,89,280,210,283,134,296,129,60,142,65,305,73,147,51,268,334,94,40,220,189,130,270,308,260,78,245,104,162,118,39,267,128,76,193,112,96,224,99,28,237,160,289,27,32,144,159,168,221,42,165,66,68,279,83,109,37,255,92,102,146,113,300,19,201,250,121,198,181,190,172,209,211,145,232,45,187,171,59,10,14,219,338,61,247,108,93,329,248,326,140,26,273,319,291,287,253,156,295,339,133,52,258,84,322,185,176,114,29,119,214,186,212,238,151,105,126,33,4,332,74,177,303,44,131,152,200,100,141,135,22","85,92,24,26,162","10, 15, 24, 25, 30, 31, 33, 39, 41, 42"

His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.","242,303,46,67,292,1,228,8,244,76,272,85,113,157,116,240,253,143,175,180,181,318,84,289,217,313,17,285,87,99,277,34,325,63,225,238,194,42,308,91,120,290,258,92,329,142,88,280,141,332,191,327,18,132,320,124,307,317,106,90,199,237,230,213,207,262,254,162,223,206,23,274,150,72,176,215,271,301,82,158,309,298,197,66,110,312,33,54,324,156,273,127,134,109,174,304,57,275,186,49,2,167,19,21,11,149,111,291,39,36,163,138,24,250,268,302,283,117,173,222,31,47,68,236,107,94,299,203,114,129,30,331,178,286,293,105,40,61,148,212,339,77,103,322,139,224,314,337,198,221,25,136,182,133,269,50,172,205,306,188,73,153,16,171,294,59,95,93,89,305,316,218,144,311,161,70,241,334,211,336,52,51,227,80,287,145,28,190,100,125,78,0,184,155,86,266,119,310,10,3","115,155,77,11,91","The collaboration ended in a fiasco, serving as a stark reminder that one should not be swayed by mere appearances.

271,Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.,"Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.","166,33,139,284,10,252,203,128,305,207,103,246,81,204,53,101,173,285,310,191,300,256,70,65,296,294,131,176,56,205,332,276,124,268,156,134,24,106,248,97,34,298,201,151,219,93,265,7,208,67,244,283,167,264,177,242,292,228,195,232,288,44,237,150,0,40,22,31,280,162,129,49,214,123,266,6,272,301,206,146,217,157,26,179,15,339,328,2,64,133,141,122,313,99,182,35,36,13,91,69,126,98,269,184,338,319,304,52,330,59,312,212,230,231,145,46,117,198,50,112,76,257,79,277,116,21,175,290,136,66,333,63,235,86,94,5,221,23,186,125,251,261,142,311,315,169,273,30,263,299,138,258,180,255,316,216,172,89,8,100,42,249,110,320,289,160,28,120,119,303,144,9,243,197,38,306,83,278,270,165,279,225,84,132,18,113,200,234,85,158,155,233,92,17,254,275,159,87,336,96","34,103,179,77,147","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.","337,35,158,63,125,291,244,99,5,12,230,84,146,275,324,191,271,325,75,307,31,52,228,24,81,283,120,210,166,70,233,148,327,43,65,7,249,115,270,119,141,3,108,309,252,224,135,204,296,21,153,335,207,257,58,39,114,22,183,247,88,211,124,318,294,286,203,105,69,60,67,85,94,319,314,267,284,157,76,227,48,18,26,27,321,132,32,121,236,55,38,329,169,281,312,200,300,323,42,0,322,302,44,13,46,101,182,320,306,216,155,266,130,126,159,292,268,278,238,15,231,237,176,144,25,336,117,232,277,138,122,330,201,54,150,259,116,334,192,118,311,187,41,188,57,10,297,173,143,202,23,190,333,19,9,92,205,6,179,310,290,198,209,221,136,217,87,14,285,197,177,104,16,253,279,171,145,91,280,33,326,239,256,152,79,269,4,331,72,251,49,113,11,164,272,289,106,274,40,248","117,186,39,17,195","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.","158,166,54,99,50,182,83,285,310,331,140,67,46,219,110,142,213,30,3,325,86,277,193,326,284,211,108,5,71,45,220,53,191,257,276,6,121,61,156,33,174,115,24,242,234,215,282,248,178,56,239,286,232,274,210,332,181,333,35,260,226,93,195,80,94,309,81,278,290,218,280,261,62,37,214,194,336,76,225,154,75,252,217,203,1,287,141,172,89,313,14,149,34,240,126,330,272,106,59,48,224,292,250,198,199,90,25,321,28,130,15,77,84,316,247,167,18,123,293,297,17,271,197,267,253,184,223,0,74,202,36,329,273,299,268,296,147,78,112,180,43,165,73,338,68,20,328,235,120,303,47,119,279,183,21,231,281,153,66,315,206,79,192,91,236,2,168,131,163,251,139,173,114,95,262,138,135,98,162,113,209,9,169,189,159,283,304,318,7,314,16,228,101,129,64,103,188,186,40,245","54,35,22,68,153,71,157,47,186","1, 6, 7, 9, 16, 21, 22, 32, 33, 34"
276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.","283,252,229,100,55,115,178,279,88,220,8,246,29,4,288,208,14,108,51,301,307,77,149,102,277,171,184,70,308,235,116,173,271,123,169,240,119,167,318,270,120,312,192,68,304,327,224,98,186,54,12,222,93,335,267,5,66,38,72,152,191,23,175,211,43,78,305,241,114,27,336,109,266,137,31,71,284,185,41,36,256,258,97,156,187,99,48,247,269,285,254,157,118,280,281,319,16,303,143,205,257,215,89,131,121,138,113,233,3,160,49,151,317,199,163,177,129,268,130,46,59,13,206,84,126,293,139,95,159,250,141,314,15,329,28,236,180,210,162,1,234,134,282,10,306,195,278,260,117,261,239,274,218,255,32,213,65,296,198,264,91,313,30,165,251,150,39,140,193,287,83,81,324,19,101,80,63,94,148,124,18,92,244,214,144,61,231,2,302,275,332,33,190,188,37,238,209,69,227,166","152,190,25,147,8,94,95,143,1","1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19"
277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.","175,143,247,200,322,7,86,181,111,211,202,182,281,155,32,160,23,294,140,264,105,271,87,168,72,248,169,100,262,308,128,237,334,35,176,316,214,106,258,164,293,58,17,186,26,187,330,118,67,263,69,228,24,268,221,303,279,78,204,312,206,193,116,95,151,291,54,283,49,37,185,120,115,320,130,274,28,238,178,63,68,329,265,209,275,269,129,300,192,338,273,64,255,189,216,324,10,31,276,99,231,266,57,165,220,66,336,170,299,110,235,278,157,138,166,298,142,313,270,153,85,197,137,112,146,208,335,14,272,30,280,145,241,229,297,217,302,306,190,223,339,199,4,113,45,286,309,83,51,19,284,44,126,61,89,252,282,29,147,109,56,194,233,3,88,174,317,52,47,287,27,36,305,34,234,46,311,62,119,307,135,152,20,295,333,292,218,74,323,328,91,213,177,225,222,79,134,16,144,125","76,85,99,112,57,131,13,157,68","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.","110,70,56,139,282,177,267,217,131,208,47,273,160,35,19,6,94,200,152,30,183,115,55,330,156,44,279,194,141,178,133,255,93,143,140,283,196,261,263,46,247,8,130,117,234,197,135,202,65,154,59,269,270,294,125,182,79,72,321,327,48,83,274,180,320,316,27,18,69,153,314,272,288,203,293,50,13,15,227,232,213,42,126,190,277,311,51,246,11,313,300,37,245,148,201,221,281,123,297,244,106,121,326,100,338,262,296,302,104,176,149,265,276,218,71,101,251,172,138,158,188,96,306,163,257,223,129,24,31,275,254,212,113,80,249,82,1,310,105,99,260,155,81,116,109,151,39,127,264,230,328,40,108,236,242,0,64,29,77,128,211,171,339,184,62,337,220,268,325,52,280,173,319,253,146,36,67,124,78,336,38,164,25,137,329,219,84,287,285,63,198,57,97,86,66,103,12,107,179,34","63,130,113,85,27,171,97,5,36","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"The highly anticipated opening of the local theater's newest play, ""Murder in the Manor,"" was approaching. Everything had been planned meticulously, from the intricate set designs to the finely tailored costumes. However, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play, threatening its ultimate success.

First, the star actor, known for his melodramatic portrayal of the villain, fell ill with laryngitis. His unique voice was a trademark of his performances, and without it, the play was off to a rocky start. Next, a critical prop, the ornate dagger for the climactic murder scene, was mysteriously lost. The team had searched everywhere but to no avail. 

As if matters couldn't get worse, a fire broke out in the costume room, causing damage to several important pieces. Then, the heavy, antique chandelier, a vital part of the set, crashed onto the stage during a rehearsal, narrowly missing the stand-ins. Furthermore, incessant rainfall led to a leak in the theatre's roof, flooding the orchestra pit.

Despite these setbacks, the determined cast and crew soldiered on, refusing to let their hard work go to waste. Their resilience in the face of adversity was a testament to their passion for the theater. After all, the show must go on.","133,45,262,75,195,253,274,265,219,330,134,266,110,99,188,280,90,155,37,225,192,38,199,268,91,211,56,168,62,36,1,244,41,44,171,261,229,172,159,194,167,59,214,193,129,239,132,145,335,190,275,51,119,203,126,243,258,6,295,130,22,292,310,131,250,13,249,153,16,35,224,259,256,238,114,177,271,311,165,140,19,234,40,162,226,10,277,15,151,191,320,60,176,55,20,197,163,278,272,270,107,68,332,212,189,141,121,307,94,282,237,300,115,113,109,66,111,157,301,179,30,136,69,25,34,283,118,88,96,14,298,39,213,7,227,61,228,83,127,333,93,293,235,217,79,23,276,286,65,313,89,204,205,232,104,144,284,314,269,158,48,128,112,326,47,242,76,290,97,254,198,236,166,161,322,87,57,241,233,148,209,21,221,4,319,281,80,305,317,8,5,120,210,223,9,327,201,46,100,334","7,51,147,87,98,16,186,110,126","1, 5, 10, 21, 27, 34, 50, 51, 69, 70"
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"The economic depression that began to grip the nation was not a sudden event. In fact, it was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies that had been implemented over a period of years. The government, in a bid to stimulate economic growth, had begun to invest heavily in risky ventures.

Early on, the nation had seen a surge in economic activity. It seemed for a while that the risky policies were actually paying off. Yet, a keen observer would have noticed the unsustainable trajectory of this growth. Many companies, fueled by reckless investments, were expanding at a rate far beyond their means.

However, the bubble burst when these companies began defaulting on their loans. Banks, suddenly faced with massive losses, began to tighten their loan policies. As credit began to dry up, businesses started to fold, leading to layoffs and the economic depression. Therefore, it can be seen that this depression was not a random event, but a consequence of several risky fiscal policies.","252,7,265,336,64,228,329,215,9,239,19,304,266,87,123,21,173,318,86,66,250,315,108,184,270,206,321,166,229,326,204,155,305,11,14,15,172,177,77,248,198,277,242,194,276,244,25,35,139,313,149,80,201,282,249,223,67,85,154,240,199,208,161,268,319,219,105,49,323,254,17,63,59,174,137,207,216,191,156,227,56,205,57,160,331,33,99,292,283,330,34,190,314,196,285,176,274,106,307,203,224,294,129,101,170,232,103,212,300,267,26,58,153,312,179,220,94,278,45,98,65,83,81,110,36,135,210,0,76,322,84,119,27,82,301,311,134,180,93,117,316,92,197,125,171,47,150,109,222,111,291,130,40,29,175,89,299,140,334,337,147,237,136,48,275,241,281,120,288,339,325,214,245,279,96,168,22,333,50,260,253,287,296,165,328,317,113,116,69,132,272,309,226,295,211,308,338,218,104,151","97,165,45,42,118,174,167,54,89","8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 31, 32, 36"
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.","95,44,31,205,169,201,220,234,219,251,49,212,145,332,91,18,140,216,99,61,299,144,13,246,96,329,310,24,72,271,226,328,196,316,176,56,166,228,306,174,275,280,41,307,163,183,78,239,317,57,28,161,300,35,134,191,4,125,101,104,106,273,202,117,139,97,325,294,296,274,333,264,259,235,75,84,192,25,30,222,190,48,26,148,194,178,32,179,16,157,165,70,327,217,110,323,236,3,305,109,262,52,272,282,23,269,270,311,203,40,277,298,89,180,182,93,321,172,301,293,128,33,283,318,62,160,142,339,77,315,330,50,309,132,65,54,240,279,59,233,204,38,287,153,224,94,162,250,312,98,291,152,141,227,218,10,199,319,208,12,68,69,242,80,338,244,225,108,81,71,135,278,238,51,276,229,85,53,324,314,193,146,322,73,64,207,120,15,22,17,88,74,260,82,266,0,257,268,170,92","70,41,175,111,172,138,42,104,123","2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 21, 22, 23, 25, 42"
282,He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.,"It was a peaceful Sunday afternoon when Tom decided to undertake a home improvement project. He had been contemplating for a while about hanging a vintage painting he'd bought from a local garage sale. It was a fascinating piece of art, adding a warm charm to the simple ambiance of his living room. So, he decided it was time to showcase it on the main wall. 

He rummaged through his toolbox, retrieved a heavy-duty hammer and a strong, shiny nail. Holding the nail against the wall, he carefully positioned it to ensure the painting would hang perfectly. Raising the hammer, he skillfully swung it back and forth, steadily driving the nail deeper into the wall. Each strike resonated in the quiet room, announcing the start of the transformation process. 

He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer until it was perfectly placed, ready to hold the weight of the antique frame. Finally, satisfied with his efforts, he gently hung the painting, turning his living room wall into an exhibition of elegance and class.","92,71,181,288,140,299,144,194,153,83,33,190,122,281,113,151,276,277,5,202,109,119,3,59,177,97,93,88,172,74,120,80,278,249,261,196,262,55,69,206,238,147,273,10,35,335,308,105,203,42,204,89,218,43,295,224,128,145,170,161,157,296,205,39,87,244,34,320,104,219,311,270,220,338,292,180,318,171,289,169,253,24,210,84,250,12,134,139,319,243,8,236,231,306,233,179,108,291,254,131,30,44,15,102,57,166,49,46,293,101,75,66,138,106,315,21,314,14,268,160,339,156,242,130,168,90,137,330,198,304,28,305,227,256,178,58,64,111,275,132,61,274,85,327,167,217,192,255,123,126,40,251,290,73,125,158,309,11,183,237,283,38,230,279,148,47,324,298,229,184,103,307,142,235,31,221,79,193,280,188,32,271,186,257,51,195,36,117,302,86,17,162,316,265,100,155,62,76,54,72","142,139,17,18,33,164,179,14,161","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
283,Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.,"Sophie had always taken pride in her own ideas, often revelging in the praise her original thinking received. She was known for her imagination, her perspectives that wove a different narrative, an unusual point of view. However, one day, she stumbled upon a series of novels that came highly recommended from her mentor. With anticipation, she turned the first page of the book, unaware of how significantly her mindset was about to shift. 

Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book, each page containing a point of view or analysis that clashed with her previous understanding. The characters and the settings were not the only elements that intrigued her, the ideologies and the morals it portrayed made her question her own beliefs. It wasn't a gentle nudge to her psyche but rather a startling shove, compelling her to step back and reconsider what she thought she knew. 

She wrestled with these new notions, her mind constantly consumed by the storm of thoughts. Gradually, as she engaged more with these texts, she realized the importance of constantly challenging one's beliefs. The books opened her up to a realm of understanding and acceptance, and Sophie learned that no idea is absolute, every thought and belief is meant to be questioned and understood deeply.","165,194,238,29,73,306,282,305,241,112,58,55,22,252,179,31,186,242,297,177,336,248,204,62,120,89,51,299,2,232,185,90,122,231,98,88,309,169,280,70,244,243,166,81,275,314,84,279,184,161,239,75,135,173,110,302,240,180,49,281,167,261,7,17,268,72,206,202,335,296,317,142,276,16,79,176,97,119,155,74,245,307,331,215,149,264,175,10,18,237,139,99,178,293,133,254,26,52,67,265,183,85,272,223,230,333,321,42,65,235,328,174,101,15,109,292,53,44,162,316,61,124,322,77,147,214,311,69,277,159,13,106,298,78,263,82,255,3,118,323,4,157,25,171,286,138,21,247,131,337,12,332,87,23,92,137,224,45,32,250,11,208,20,334,86,95,278,24,300,158,234,294,140,33,219,189,63,113,269,40,47,150,103,274,295,227,129,260,71,146,160,324,304,246,105,327,50,163,91,56","184,45,73,129,167,48,39,60,7","2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18"
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"It's hard to love with a broken heart. Mary knew this all too well as she looked at her own reflection in the mirror. The lines of sadness etched in her face, her eyes dull and lifeless. It was as though her very soul had been shattered into pieces. She had once been vibrant and full of life, but now she was just a husk of her former self.

Her heart, once whole and filled with love, had been broken by the man she loved more than anything in the world. Betrayal had taken its toll, transforming her from a carefree woman in love to a broken shell, mistrustful and afraid to love again. She turned away from the mirror, her heart aching at the sight of her broken self. 

Every day was a struggle to get out of bed, to face the world with a false smile while her heart was bleeding. It was hard to love with a broken heart, indeed, but Mary knew that she needed to find a way to heal, to love again, for her own sanity and happiness.","229,190,108,219,163,288,143,74,205,282,275,251,329,65,250,296,245,20,114,21,239,119,24,315,220,58,260,206,14,249,328,16,246,201,318,298,133,88,155,208,172,193,332,271,102,117,290,28,135,57,87,192,106,94,140,3,8,313,68,276,320,118,6,174,158,160,134,60,141,247,36,11,176,211,157,331,185,169,281,131,80,241,53,138,103,228,84,107,31,25,122,292,321,182,200,183,180,224,71,299,147,273,42,261,115,283,124,266,234,319,55,309,186,258,129,240,51,48,142,76,137,188,294,79,225,173,286,49,167,195,334,97,33,221,295,278,64,279,82,10,128,202,12,52,13,305,291,123,194,27,184,337,302,248,285,217,26,151,300,95,37,0,187,70,175,101,244,289,323,152,7,242,1,50,233,304,77,209,121,222,150,216,232,191,314,297,139,91,153,61,165,132,287,254,312,327,85,230,265,317","155,127,193,6,168,47,147","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14"
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.","150,272,176,286,292,177,165,318,43,239,20,81,241,9,117,56,316,0,35,303,276,10,99,145,252,328,278,281,120,68,267,85,167,164,338,210,168,126,95,51,41,293,311,255,279,62,48,149,21,284,44,128,98,262,69,260,144,191,339,29,83,250,214,251,60,23,274,306,320,137,72,288,122,245,111,266,232,193,282,28,211,184,325,116,336,58,243,194,16,314,172,107,40,92,198,273,163,139,93,312,36,66,220,67,322,123,226,3,228,287,204,109,326,17,337,233,182,63,135,143,31,212,162,57,80,224,196,147,217,152,265,289,2,199,242,11,221,205,203,197,155,254,114,225,26,333,130,258,32,59,71,291,73,5,34,231,52,110,6,33,146,103,280,82,213,118,161,200,8,309,332,208,180,102,299,86,185,290,187,138,216,112,277,158,321,174,78,121,294,334,45,275,19,37,30,246,88,7,297,259","50,4,110,72,132,178,152","1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11"
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"Lily was the kind of person who was always running around trying to help others. She had an exceptional kind heart, always lending a hand, lending an ear, and giving out pieces of her heart to those in need. Her friends, family, and even sometimes strangers benefited from her tireless dedication to making people's lives better. However, Lily often neglected her own needs. 

One day, her close friend, Maria, noticed the tiredness in Lily's eyes. She was a shadow of her bubbly self, a clear indication she was drained. Maria gently reminded her, ""Lily, you can't pour from an empty cup."" 

Lily looked puzzled, so Maria explained, ""You give so much of yourself, but you can't forget to replenish your own energy."" Maria reminded Lily about the importance of self-care, of setting boundaries and ensuring her own cup was filled before she attempted to fill others. It was a lesson Lily took to heart, finally understanding that she couldn't effectively help others if she herself was running on empty.","46,305,234,50,22,290,262,287,259,270,321,188,171,66,132,295,54,45,339,335,38,155,163,102,242,101,55,299,231,308,92,309,173,244,297,174,170,161,332,213,59,106,90,17,61,150,217,328,207,243,130,44,67,193,322,88,110,253,157,263,18,154,272,10,77,184,178,208,291,182,284,251,216,230,256,108,58,9,48,249,2,118,176,191,235,313,91,107,4,292,15,65,196,47,248,68,211,5,285,320,26,311,218,293,158,127,89,122,64,11,326,120,21,49,121,117,151,141,296,160,250,36,252,159,289,175,97,214,81,205,42,277,137,148,192,241,116,103,266,274,100,16,301,78,149,87,303,199,70,136,197,283,257,194,35,236,329,209,204,0,267,24,179,6,119,82,258,203,281,128,271,190,51,1,144,31,133,306,304,52,255,198,327,123,247,85,111,135,83,307,181,228,8,142,27,113,186,288,33,232","71,99,8,198,125,6,69","1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17"
287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest adorned with lush green trees, there stood a magnificent oak tree, the oldest and tallest among them. Its grandeur and magnificent aura provided shade and shelter to countless creatures. One fateful night, a storm ravaged the forest, severely damaging many of the trees. The relentless winds managed to fell the grand oak tree, it's mighty fall echoed throughout the forest. 

Come the morning, the woodland inhabitants were in for a shock. The vast expanse that once thrived under the shade of the grand oak was now exposed to the scorching sun. A fallen tree, it was realized, cannot provide shade, a sentiment that echoed through every creature's heart. The squirrels, the birds, the insects, all missed the comforting shade they once called home. 

This realization marked a turning point in the lives of the forest dwellers. Despite the loss of their beloved tree, they understood the power of change, even if it was painful. And in the grand oak's memory, they grew stronger, embracing the sunlight with resilience, and learned to adapt to their new environment.","62,166,146,319,17,9,64,291,39,24,21,104,321,51,2,315,278,239,41,148,300,95,264,210,334,197,55,136,100,127,40,237,290,216,82,74,61,116,303,220,246,79,65,225,154,219,256,159,265,252,329,123,289,254,92,142,94,138,33,58,5,199,70,309,181,325,174,333,160,78,244,14,128,205,83,293,80,111,179,42,99,336,243,184,45,209,0,157,221,103,114,76,323,48,288,185,143,86,260,233,276,101,207,314,284,29,275,330,97,124,57,234,155,295,23,316,126,110,223,211,227,68,69,169,163,18,206,224,272,139,294,115,131,285,292,93,186,195,301,324,182,30,231,38,107,258,77,168,71,305,137,176,338,311,188,213,286,255,109,164,229,50,230,245,20,119,117,108,277,263,269,302,19,152,297,238,129,150,279,183,308,248,198,242,52,274,89,170,49,87,118,28,25,251,44,11,135,320,172,236","105,134,157,95,53,33,8","8, 11, 17, 22, 26, 35, 36, 41, 53, 61"
288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"On a snowy night, in a tiny town on the edge of the world, there was a house so old, every nook and corner echoed stories of time. This house was lit only by the glow of a hundred candles; an extraordinary sight to see from the outside, creating a sparkling mirage against the backdrop of the cold white surroundings. 

However, one day a strong breeze blew through the house, extinguishing all the candles and leaving it in complete darkness. The owners of the house, an elderly couple, did not have any extra candles. ""No light can be found from an unlit candle,"" the old man muttered, feeling around in the darkness. His wife echoed his thoughts, sighing in dismay. 

Despair started to seep in when they thought of the long, cold night that awaited them. However, the old lady remembered a tiny, forgotten candle she had saved for years, tucked away in a corner. With a striking match, the last candle was lit, casting a warm glow in the room. The house had lost its grandeur for the night, but the couple was content, comforted by the small but enduring glow of their solitary candle.","289,276,221,27,198,258,336,40,226,10,101,248,219,133,41,62,200,192,155,17,302,110,120,44,146,187,228,232,301,251,20,263,80,267,254,199,247,124,330,322,24,327,121,253,211,213,86,58,47,157,207,332,284,291,257,283,222,317,268,183,329,308,75,31,15,37,61,53,50,304,285,102,325,147,201,134,43,287,205,316,12,158,67,161,334,57,74,6,71,152,5,165,103,326,106,22,274,112,333,39,130,314,239,273,78,269,339,225,310,140,299,25,245,117,182,118,212,335,275,173,1,214,23,105,249,148,59,223,122,79,89,176,235,178,69,95,141,298,115,270,54,98,33,323,132,139,87,286,297,236,93,16,307,2,311,92,116,38,306,73,315,85,290,259,303,321,65,109,154,91,49,318,234,136,180,282,36,295,145,338,204,174,194,197,216,179,11,218,252,96,265,153,184,19,52,28,231,224,45,83","53,71,148,78,1,163,54","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
289,You can't write from an inkless pen.,"The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.","97,211,141,225,7,25,18,41,316,249,234,120,286,295,204,148,191,196,21,189,72,99,69,226,339,171,0,194,274,116,109,89,181,270,252,284,157,213,76,156,185,74,139,77,229,334,283,153,298,259,182,236,291,328,143,149,49,306,192,326,113,198,50,52,1,256,32,327,224,230,45,59,119,138,56,201,35,280,31,324,222,333,22,152,8,91,287,297,188,60,125,133,154,121,146,95,207,217,85,264,144,71,12,260,145,243,269,62,281,231,163,254,301,160,265,202,28,318,137,235,337,43,3,112,215,122,161,266,158,290,292,238,87,165,288,312,4,308,123,209,253,170,300,247,93,219,73,16,159,84,30,221,335,2,124,128,199,162,20,296,65,164,245,309,132,14,332,142,174,240,261,278,117,331,206,175,68,44,134,168,79,111,102,180,110,311,244,214,197,55,104,166,83,183,285,147,67,319,151,114","36,195,13,87,135,130,53","11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27"

He unlocked his car, throwing his briefcase onto the backseat before sinking into the driver's seat. However, when he inserted his keys and turned on the ignition, all he heard was a sputtering noise. He tried again, but the car refused to come to life, only giving out faint, distressed sounds.

With a sinking feeling, he glanced at the fuel gauge. It was on empty. A frustrated groan escaped his lips as he remembered passing the gas station earlier, opting not to stop, thinking he had enough fuel to last the trip home. He now realized how wrong he was. ""I guess I've learned the hard way,"" he muttered, reaching for his phone to call a tow truck.

Among his scant possessions was a single china plate that he used for all his meals. One afternoon, as he was cleaning his plate, it slipped from his hands and shattered into a dozen pieces. Henry stared at the fragments in disbelief. 

""No,"" he murmured to himself. ""One can't eat from a broken plate."" His mind raced as he tried to come up with a solution. With a sigh, he realized he would have to save up to buy a new one.

292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.","339,23,85,217,270,35,329,242,326,325,214,172,222,33,40,302,177,295,109,208,262,161,236,328,140,268,186,9,53,46,17,207,64,28,89,204,29,238,193,56,230,3,174,327,307,171,108,73,68,148,255,42,101,118,116,74,322,196,137,25,164,63,10,233,86,112,265,173,0,271,170,294,296,5,246,160,113,212,105,317,324,247,93,303,4,49,39,338,54,323,195,250,146,24,231,191,133,224,298,90,88,190,136,120,309,235,241,106,100,251,99,41,12,87,154,197,158,301,1,162,192,334,336,139,67,248,187,229,312,175,216,159,264,276,94,260,156,144,272,157,51,254,43,281,293,218,36,125,213,221,199,286,130,205,237,151,306,62,202,313,337,155,60,318,215,165,96,314,320,107,274,121,194,300,14,206,180,310,225,275,21,134,18,65,122,297,37,285,117,30,69,152,263,188,167,181,27,166,78,45","145,72,18,73,186","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"Lake Erie is a beautiful and serene body of water, located in the northern part of the United States. This vast expanse of water is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from all corners of the world. Yet, one of the most fascinating aspects of Lake Erie is not just its beauty, but the role it plays in the complex and fascinating hydrological system of the Great Lakes.

Lake Erie drains its waters into another of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario. This transition of waters occurs via an extraordinary body of water, the Niagara River. The river is relatively short, merely 36 miles long, but plays an essential role in the transfer of waters between these two Great Lakes.

However, the journey from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not a simple, direct flow. The waters pass through a remarkable natural spectacle, the Niagara Falls. The thunderous roar of the Falls and the misty aura created by the falling water is a mesmerizing sight.

This journey of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is more than a geographical process. It serves as an embodiment of the dynamism and interconnectedness of nature. Above all, it's a reminder of the impermanence of things and the constancy of change, as the waters of Lake Erie perpetually flow into Lake Ontario, continuing the endless cycle of life.","107,229,265,240,284,157,136,222,287,233,185,335,294,119,216,297,118,9,337,336,43,138,143,122,186,339,299,272,191,57,101,190,316,95,290,46,84,158,266,194,220,179,148,219,175,62,4,193,55,270,121,110,130,288,252,81,8,228,167,21,259,34,23,278,56,255,254,39,244,47,24,181,91,117,221,289,160,180,151,6,82,327,152,325,129,13,108,286,318,53,61,301,78,276,267,63,35,70,319,206,303,140,208,161,199,209,172,86,96,235,246,217,120,296,132,332,79,277,38,49,44,155,115,326,170,36,109,214,243,149,146,131,18,3,273,25,80,269,59,45,147,1,104,174,153,302,292,311,168,93,133,215,188,195,205,236,275,171,20,164,281,72,308,15,262,126,94,50,68,111,212,100,10,323,71,227,241,322,245,334,64,75,218,97,280,230,268,103,234,5,333,0,145,66,40,27,42,26,137,295","147,13,200,114,16","1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 21, 24, 28"

The time spent with Tim was always focused on instilling bits of knowledge in him, mainly by simple communication. Each evening, they would sit in the living room surrounded by a sea of books, discussing life and all it entailed. 

Sam's teaching method was diverse, stretching from reading the classics to observing the nighttime stars. Each day was a new lesson, another chance to instill a nugget of wisdom in Tim. Conversations would range from the complex mathematical concepts to the symbiotic relationships in nature. Sam's intent was not just to make Tim knowledgeable, but also to help him see the world from different perspectives. 

He believed that the power of knowledge was rooted in understanding and analyzing, rather than rote memorization.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate.

296,Part of the state budget comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package.,"In the bustling state capital, politicians fervently debated the latest budget proposal. Part of the state budget, they realized, comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package. This spending package, while beneficial for some areas, sparked controversy nationwide due to its allocation towards controversial projects.

Governor Thompson, a seasoned politician, was troubled by this reality. He was aware of the constituents' growing concerns about accepting funds from a package that many of them fundamentally disagreed with. However, he also understood the dire need for financial resources in several underfunded areas within the state.

During a highly publicized town hall meeting, he addressed the issue head-on. He tried to explain the intricate balance of economics and politics involved in budget decisions. Many left the meeting still disgruntled, but a few seemed to appreciate the governor's honesty.

Thompson knew it was only the beginning of a long journey. Accepting the funds meant the ability to kick start much-needed initiatives in the state, but it also meant negotiating a delicate political landscape. He understood that as a leader, he had to face these difficult decisions, trying to serve his state's best interests amidst a sea of discord.","282,173,154,57,293,63,323,298,110,321,13,203,266,305,106,113,246,211,81,320,304,78,98,231,242,170,174,295,215,287,247,294,141,93,101,52,333,230,213,129,299,260,147,132,300,253,268,189,135,150,201,334,62,236,123,139,191,196,1,119,32,112,261,94,241,327,325,229,183,338,270,249,318,197,330,313,258,3,209,172,302,118,59,86,22,131,226,314,274,167,182,18,250,71,188,12,111,148,138,175,254,186,164,163,185,317,273,205,69,245,92,15,280,308,105,128,286,219,124,37,35,51,290,29,271,45,324,47,214,144,259,4,284,262,301,223,193,195,50,257,179,339,88,243,114,5,272,99,30,267,283,178,134,23,187,169,56,44,291,85,102,109,66,49,171,217,180,199,240,218,58,255,220,27,24,264,122,9,40,26,70,100,224,289,79,234,156,292,39,235,316,281,65,297,20,269,227,96,190,137","188,5,32,28,194","2, 10, 13, 17, 20, 22, 29, 30, 36, 49"
297,My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.,"Every morning, I have a steadfast routine of strolling into the downtown cafe for my daily fix of caffeine. It's an indulgence I've always allowed myself, rationalizing that it's a small expense for such a big pleasure. A double-shot of espresso to start my day, a late morning latte, an afternoon cappuccino; coffee was my fuel, my lifeline. 

I never really thought about my tiny daily coffee expenses until I began to audit my finances. As a freelance graphic designer, my income was wildly inconsistent, but the expense for my coffee never faltered. When I sat down to pour over my bank statement, I was floored. The daily $5 here and $4 there had accumulated over the month into a sizable portion of my income. 

Staring at the numbers, I felt a knot in my stomach. I realized that my beloved coffee habit was draining up all my income. The decision was difficult, but inevitable; the time had come to invest in a coffee machine at home and drastically cut down on my cafe visits.","215,214,86,8,293,101,106,146,273,331,39,276,64,51,40,270,140,300,247,173,182,155,194,277,260,44,256,166,54,23,3,112,266,316,171,271,129,161,202,261,89,318,136,85,10,134,75,77,147,27,209,191,184,145,217,251,268,135,304,332,50,61,12,70,238,306,159,14,172,235,216,219,269,180,222,207,49,94,24,244,95,286,21,109,120,336,212,69,187,193,313,265,55,62,330,90,97,84,321,149,151,294,31,178,160,308,199,16,52,307,208,79,123,157,317,296,299,46,231,257,127,292,88,205,282,156,93,233,20,18,245,128,248,114,295,323,142,15,65,122,81,239,119,144,71,181,66,26,130,312,110,259,287,163,328,131,34,200,162,1,13,192,262,170,186,73,25,339,298,43,148,243,234,249,113,153,302,57,42,121,189,334,99,188,267,289,211,174,102,19,224,28,138,118,103,246,327,58,87,325","122,5,102,135,116","1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12"

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.","211,42,65,11,197,321,320,41,21,271,232,290,185,127,313,40,237,18,4,138,200,1,124,116,166,152,38,35,52,177,170,43,287,87,53,62,128,181,46,90,273,5,295,263,192,277,302,55,300,113,132,94,221,304,224,267,203,262,186,56,319,187,196,180,19,0,15,220,148,34,324,239,14,139,147,86,182,257,248,110,33,45,39,120,269,137,104,165,106,50,17,190,111,199,193,169,105,315,64,275,59,99,327,154,213,312,318,188,322,13,176,276,126,233,308,249,156,264,93,121,73,219,323,278,314,103,143,326,335,117,259,306,118,158,114,299,325,29,79,22,285,284,44,195,305,133,270,228,122,81,317,141,241,328,301,51,174,252,27,123,136,238,293,191,135,171,23,61,92,296,212,119,28,144,102,2,149,173,69,31,58,236,250,150,25,74,88,63,207,338,6,243,244,303,283,194,258,57,332,49","136,49,155,47,194","6, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 34, 38, 39, 40"

One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs.

The clinking of glasses, the hum of conversation, it all forms an intoxicating symphony of life in its most raw and unfiltered form.

The majority of them would arrive adorned in the latest designer attire, reflecting their devotion to fashion.

After all, impulsive actions could lead to regret, especially in matters as crucial as financial investments.","130,275,283,306,153,56,266,244,92,327,243,238,39,128,207,55,12,261,277,127,212,312,61,135,158,223,42,229,198,24,3,22,36,31,11,315,63,252,333,16,148,111,222,68,26,110,187,74,177,58,265,190,199,33,6,296,136,40,32,337,41,147,25,155,124,235,174,115,220,257,29,259,171,304,249,242,263,299,307,313,166,118,165,279,91,157,278,76,21,5,206,38,320,15,255,224,88,48,151,72,269,276,131,317,154,167,50,51,20,138,289,311,186,219,71,309,129,264,93,66,188,119,59,0,139,10,8,300,132,69,308,107,94,282,82,323,141,52,47,83,291,228,161,195,339,318,142,239,125,84,193,62,247,101,182,100,233,105,303,314,145,301,108,267,225,96,152,102,86,316,270,133,78,200,232,70,79,126,335,143,1,14,227,262,162,106,260,156,217,305,113,120,7,251,246,331,321,230,248,121","112,22,80,160,36","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
311,It is better to gauge others before taking such political stands these days. You never know who is on your side and who will cause you harm for it.,"In the world of modern politics, it has become increasingly crucial to gauge others before taking firm political stands. This wisdom was something that Charlie, a young political activist, learned the hard way. Charlie was passionate, eager, and had a habit of jumping headfirst into ideological battles without considering the repercussions.

One day, he decided to openly advocate for a controversial policy, believing it was the right thing to do. He was confident that his friends would support him as they had similar views, at least as far as he knew. However, he didn't take into account the fact that not everyone shared his beliefs and passion for political engagement.

When he started receiving backlash from acquaintances and even some close friends, Charlie was taken aback. He couldn't understand why people he thought were allies, were turning against him. The painful realization dawned upon him that not everyone was in his corner, and some were even willing to harm his reputation because of his political stance.

The experience taught him a hard lesson: In the volatile atmosphere of today's politics, it is better to gauge others' thoughts and feelings before taking such political stands. You never know who is on your side and who may cause you harm for it.","164,240,190,0,34,17,232,284,116,106,277,211,312,323,199,298,220,85,212,249,173,100,213,222,68,233,18,245,257,287,314,45,300,115,248,165,330,183,99,291,295,83,219,58,281,258,54,246,76,132,19,118,48,318,81,234,316,184,38,288,111,259,28,77,30,92,32,224,182,42,61,265,10,308,44,266,186,317,278,225,328,215,214,82,335,25,84,73,33,93,204,21,75,60,231,189,147,244,86,112,37,218,56,260,174,67,158,98,126,20,46,127,144,36,313,80,307,280,168,148,273,49,334,137,138,142,290,40,130,63,155,321,206,135,315,209,152,120,217,187,329,9,306,103,2,216,302,3,276,51,150,192,110,274,235,12,228,113,87,97,109,310,26,333,210,229,139,72,31,196,301,159,66,65,303,11,16,107,91,160,124,285,236,94,194,162,293,221,131,275,102,242,47,53,161,1,208,327,264,171","162,13,115,31,135","4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13"

So, my father decides to wait to buy it so he can take more opinions from different people.","In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house?

Gary regrets not planning and starting during the spring and summer season when results are more visible.,"Gary had always been passionate about nurturing things, which gradually led to a love for gardening. As a professional baseball player, he had little time to indulge in this passion of his during the active seasons. It was during the off season, he decided to invest both his time and money into creating a small garden for himself.

Gary purchased various seeds, gardening tools and started laboring in his backyard, tirelessly. Over time, his backyard began to reflect his hard work. A neat little garden with budding greens started taking shape, bringing him immense joy.

But as the winter months began to roll in, he noticed that his garden was not faring as well as he had imagined. The lack of ample sunlight and warmth was affecting the growth of his plants. It was at that point that Gary felt a pang of regret.

He wished he had started planning and working on his garden during the spring and summer seasons when the plants would have enjoyed optimal conditions for growth. The plants would have been more visible, lush, and healthy. Despite the regret, Gary was not disheartened. He was now better prepared for the next season and eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to enhance his garden.","112,279,194,203,166,146,322,118,122,102,201,71,43,113,339,291,225,15,316,253,318,144,227,33,117,40,100,262,161,164,223,327,92,277,143,151,119,218,157,205,197,281,93,256,6,202,206,211,241,104,270,213,229,96,226,41,66,244,196,110,39,86,304,44,35,153,259,246,224,200,265,57,263,94,289,272,147,185,295,302,70,314,177,36,154,12,276,285,188,261,14,247,288,46,334,10,199,0,169,294,136,307,175,91,306,332,264,312,266,65,186,108,3,243,326,89,198,38,249,75,4,275,88,183,47,338,299,130,210,239,233,324,37,101,52,9,156,168,280,116,139,184,124,329,282,335,274,45,163,109,191,284,323,176,58,217,99,328,258,208,310,298,83,287,140,59,209,228,134,98,309,319,301,315,212,155,77,171,330,127,30,305,115,311,308,111,135,13,240,64,138,18,28,286,31,303,293,193,82,189","161,184,108,82,174",200

And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue.

He started his campaign as a dark horse. His opponents were well-known figures in politics. They underestimated his power, seeing him as little more than a nuisance. But, his constant perseverance and the distinct integrity he possessed caught the public's attention.

The tide began to turn halfway through the campaign. His popularity soared after a powerful speech about the importance of honesty and transparency in politics. He spoke sincerely, without any hidden agenda, making sure his words reached the heart of the common man. 

His campaign team worked tirelessly to make him a prominent figure in the political landscape. The intense campaigning paid off; it was clear the politician had won over the public.

I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike.

However, there was one player who stood out for all the wrong reasons. His name was Ron. Despite possessing the physical attributes of a great player, Ron had a knack for making poor decisions at crucial moments in the game. He would frequently lose focus, his mind drifting off during team strategies, and he seemed utterly oblivious to the damage he was causing.

His lack of discipline and teamwork often undermined the combined efforts of the team, leading to crucial losses. The other players were growing frustrated with his irresponsible attitude.

She had spent countless hours crafting the perfect melodies and lyrics, pouring her heart and soul into each song. Critics and fans alike were waiting with bated breath, convinced that Laura's album would be nothing short of a masterpiece.

The album was a collection of fourteen songs, each one a poignant story, a tiny fragment of Laura's life converted into beautiful melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The first thirteen songs were nothing short of spectacular. They resonated with the listeners, reverberating with the collective human experiences of love, loss, and healing. Every note, every strum, and every beat filled the air with an irrefutable magic, making the audience sway and sing along.

But when the last song played, a distinct discomfort filled the room. It was an upbeat pop song, a stark contrast from the beautiful melancholic tunes that characterized the rest of the album. It felt out of place and jarring, breaking the emotive spell the album had cast.

Unfortunately, these opportunities were often at the expense of others, for Fred made his wealth by swindling innocent people out of their hard-earned money.

For years, Fred's empires were built on deceit and treachery, promising wealth and prosperity to those who could hardly afford to lose.

Now, after years of enjoying his ill-gotten wealth, Thomas was staring at the possibility of nearly 10 years behind the cold, bleak bars of a federal prison.","107,164,179,315,338,30,142,33,32,125,192,202,264,211,276,207,195,219,163,117,95,11,269,218,6,232,304,127,172,221,52,183,298,295,288,112,130,335,84,90,73,326,310,162,98,100,214,220,145,103,224,229,290,271,216,56,285,249,83,323,109,45,329,265,31,251,133,282,46,206,193,268,75,7,238,102,309,69,144,306,250,312,318,303,13,71,35,240,124,110,9,105,25,154,328,85,115,169,80,129,39,277,300,94,230,166,137,42,222,36,153,197,307,74,161,257,248,89,167,188,233,131,152,51,245,22,132,113,292,332,184,330,204,279,136,198,3,278,311,49,263,182,272,38,1,70,158,244,199,86,296,91,26,65,149,121,64,150,81,111,261,201,126,93,2,327,234,321,62,339,255,82,92,78,322,301,138,293,313,205,336,171,146,79,106,236,287,253,258,333,116,128,12,159,239,88,190,27,157,139","95,63,132,130,190","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"

She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.","267,174,249,166,33,288,226,156,229,167,165,89,217,275,66,40,198,76,104,269,339,325,131,157,112,328,137,179,26,6,149,79,152,85,81,211,146,301,326,38,297,286,175,299,82,273,58,99,245,277,196,264,322,118,135,140,88,224,61,142,120,207,256,296,216,28,83,281,283,105,276,190,225,333,206,300,329,16,72,236,27,323,23,162,331,319,187,148,113,147,310,189,42,132,5,214,109,126,259,158,95,327,336,272,330,29,263,262,70,94,36,219,2,37,121,238,200,52,231,192,302,213,293,282,12,320,130,258,96,4,317,177,169,304,80,133,22,117,316,227,338,252,91,68,153,98,138,284,11,324,1,34,151,172,246,291,201,208,43,250,59,334,50,71,243,24,102,234,129,240,199,204,305,125,251,87,168,44,295,119,141,56,18,62,308,306,260,19,289,195,321,230,17,127,271,74,212,170,90,107","26,77,105,85,74","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
333,The boy who cried wolf got his comeuppance once the wolves really came.,"There once was a mischievous boy, living in a small village nestled against a foreboding forest, who took great delight in tricking his fellow villagers. To pass the time, he would call out, ""Wolf! Wolf!"", feigning distress, causing the hard-working villagers to drop everything to come to his aid. He would then laugh, and his laughter echoed throughout the peaceful valley, disrupting the quiet serenity that usually prevailed. This happened time and time again, until the villagers started to lose patience with the little boy's pranks. 

One cold winter day, the boy, emboldened by past success, repeated his false cry. But this time, nobody hurried to his rescue, weary of his previous false alarms. Unbeknownst to them, however, this time, the cry was authentic. A pack of starving wolves had strayed from the forest, drawn by the scent of the village's livestock. The boy was terrified as the fierce creatures came closer and closer, his desperate cries for help fading into the chilling wind. Ultimately, the boy who cried wolf learned a grave and costly lesson, earning his comeuppance the day the wolves really came.","232,225,328,266,324,268,133,235,13,125,60,80,17,256,21,161,335,290,49,317,147,30,25,169,120,8,286,314,318,54,251,115,186,206,244,106,155,19,31,273,275,303,326,330,102,239,55,87,170,331,52,32,175,64,71,97,100,188,3,116,90,267,191,46,195,119,337,339,202,304,234,265,78,281,329,62,23,156,253,152,75,280,258,154,270,221,212,98,298,72,171,77,233,48,179,252,320,118,107,159,22,230,288,219,167,302,122,209,12,4,10,89,283,139,43,44,292,238,110,95,108,59,308,213,196,263,166,210,293,260,176,194,332,231,193,197,185,276,93,261,285,203,305,117,56,245,14,9,243,226,278,124,69,24,216,319,91,29,178,105,271,63,104,45,57,130,123,135,306,215,291,173,334,137,279,149,27,85,151,224,272,229,68,312,103,180,296,294,325,67,228,129,201,218,284,208,134,34,227,217","3,75,44,50,133","6, 15, 23, 27, 36, 47, 55, 59, 65, 73"

Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

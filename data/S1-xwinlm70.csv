Question: How to get the current user's email in .NET Core 2.2

I'm using .NET Core 2.2 with Identity and I'm trying to get the current user's email in a controller.

I've tried:

\begin{code}
var user = User.Identity.GetUserId();
var email = _userManager.GetUserAsync(user).Result.Email;
\end{code}

But I get an error:

\begin{blockquote}

System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'
\end{blockquote}

How can I get the current user's email?

Comment: You should check if `User.Identity.IsAuthenticated` before calling `GetUserId()`.

Comment: @TetsuyaYamamoto I did that and it is authenticated.

Comment: @TetsuyaYamamoto I also tried `var user = User.FindFirstValue(ClaimTypes.Name);
var email = _userManager.GetUserAsync(user).Result.Email;` and I still get the same error.

Comment: I'm not sure why you're getting `NullReference"

Is there a way to do this?

Comment: You can use `Html.Raw` to display the string without encoding it.

Question: How to make a div element to be always visible on the screen even when scrolling

I have a div element which I want to be always visible on the screen even when scrolling. I tried using `position: fixed` but it didn't work.

Here is the code:

\begin{code}
.div {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  z-index: 1000;
}
\end{code}

\begin{code}
  Hello
\end{code}

Comment: You need to set the `position: fixed` on the parent element, not the child.

Comment: @Barmar I tried that too but it didn't work.

Comment: Can you show the parent element's CSS?

Comment: @Barmar I have updated the code.

Question: How to use ViewPager with Fragments in Android Studio

I'm trying to create a ViewPager with Fragments in Android Studio, but I'm having trouble understanding how to do it. I've searched online and found many tutorials, but they all seem to be outdated or not working with the latest version of Android Studio.

I have created a `ViewPagerAdapter` class that extends `FragmentPagerAdapter`:

\begin{code}
public class ViewPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter {
    private final List<Fragment> mFragments = new ArrayList<>();
    private final List<String> mFragmentTitles = new ArrayList<>();

    public ViewPagerAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {
        super(fm);
    }

    public void addFragment(Fragment fragment, String title) {
        mFragments.add(fragment);
        mFragmentTitles.add(title);
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int position) {
        return mFragments.get(position);
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() {

1. Read the following text and answer the questions:

The Internet has revolutionized the way we access and share information, communicate with one another, and conduct business. However, the rapid pace of technological advancement has also led to new challenges and concerns, particularly in the realm of privacy and security. As we increasingly rely on digital platforms to store and transmit sensitive data, the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft has become a significant concern for both individuals and organizations alike.

In response to these concerns, various stakeholders have developed and implemented a range of security measures and technologies to protect user data and maintain privacy. One such measure is end-to-end encryption (E2EE), a secure communication method that prevents third parties from accessing or reading the content of messages or files shared between users.

End-to-end encryption works by encrypting data on the sender's device, often using a public key, before transmitting it over a communication channel. The data can only be decrypted using a private key, which is held by the intended recipient. This ensures that even if a third party were to intercept the data during transmission, they would be unable to read or make sense of it without the private key.

While end-to-end encryption is not a silver bullet solution to all privacy and security concerns"

The United States is a federal republic, which means that power is divided between the federal government and the state governments. The Constitution of the United States establishes the structure, powers, and limitations of the federal government. It also outlines the rights and liberties of the people. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all laws and government actions must comply with its provisions.

The federal government is composed of three branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch has specific powers and responsibilities, and the system of checks and balances ensures that no branch can exercise too much power.

The legislative branch is responsible for making laws. It consists of the Congress, which is divided into two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members, with the number of representatives from each state determined by population. The Senate has 100 members, with each state having two senators, regardless of population.

The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws. It is headed by the President, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and has the power to veto legislation passed by Congress. The President is elected every four years and can serve a maximum of two terms. The President"

C. The incharge was overjoyed to see that the floor had finally been cleaned properly by the new hire and was no longer slippery.
D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",A,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

D. The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.",D,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

Option C: Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.

This sentence shares a similar structure and use of metaphor as the target sentence, with the substitution of ""chicken"" for ""bayonet"" and ""delicious pasta"" for ""bare feet."" Both sentences use a vivid metaphor to describe an unexpected and unpleasant experience."
275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"A. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
B. Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book.

D. Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.",B,"A. It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence because both sentences involve a comparison of different methods or approaches. In the target sentence, ""He attacked every point in my argument"" implies a thorough critique or challenge of each aspect of the argument. Similarly, the option A compares the effectiveness of using a map with directions versus reading instructions on how to arrive at an event."

B. The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.

D. Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.",A,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

A. A succession of waves battered the rock.

This sentence is similar to the target sentence in that it describes a series of powerful forces (waves) acting on a structure (rock), leading to a similar outcome (battering). Both sentences use a similar structure and convey a similar idea, making option A the most analogous choice."
278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.

2. [B] He attacked every point in my argument.
3. [C] Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion.
4. [D] Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is option [C].

Reason:
Option [C] follows a similar structure and theme as the target sentence. Both sentences discuss a positive outcome (receiving recognition and getting a promotion) that results from a series of events or actions (hard work and diligence). The other options either have different structures or do not share the same theme as the target sentence."
280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"A. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.

D. He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer.",D,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.

This sentence is analogous because it also describes a result that was achieved through a combination of factors (in this case, months of hard campaigning), similar to the target sentence's description of the economic depression being the result of several risky fiscal policies."
281,The corporation threw in more and more money to fix the problem.,"A. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.

C. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.
D. Sally is not clueless about her situation with Scott, she has just decided to be with him despite the circumstances.",B,"# B. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.

The sentence ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health"" is the most analogous to the target sentence ""He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer"" because both sentences use a simple subject-verb-object structure and express a causal relationship between the subject and the object. In the target sentence, the subject ""he"" performs the action of ""knocking"" the object ""nail"" into the object ""wall"" using the instrument ""hammer."" In the analogous sentence, the subject ""every cigarette"" is the cause of the action ""threatening"" the object ""your health."""

C. I took three years instead of one to finish the training program, but at least I have the credential now.

This sentence shares a similar structure and meaning to the target sentence, as both involve a challenge or obstacle that the subject faces. In the target sentence, the subject's ideas are challenged as she reads book after book. In option C, the subject faces the challenge of completing a training program, which takes longer than expected. Both sentences emphasize the persistence and determination of the subject in overcoming the challenge."
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"A. Lets meet him and ask about the robbery. Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear.

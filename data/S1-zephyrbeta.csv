The second sentence is not analogous because it's about missing a bus and deciding to walk instead, which is not a difficult or unfavorable situation in the same way as the target sentence's company facing bankruptcy is. The third sentence is about being comfortable sleeping on a sofa instead of a bed, which is not a difficult or unfavorable situation in the same way as the target sentence's company facing bankruptcy is.

C. [ ]

Explanation:

The closest sentence to the target sentence in terms of the concept of overworking and needing a break is:

A. Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realised he had no work and made him do the chores all week.

In this sentence, Philip overworked himself by avoiding chores, and as a result, he needed a break by having to do all the chores for a week. This is similar to Monica, who overworked herself by cooking too much food, and as a result, needed a break by taking a leave to rest.

B and C are not analogous because they do not involve overworking and needing a break.

In B, ""He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep"" is not analogous because it does not involve overworking or needing a break. It is simply a statement about someone's actions after consuming sugar.

In C, ""After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos"" is not analogous because it does not involve overworking or needing a break. It is simply a statement about someone changing careers.

Note: The sentence ""After working two years for the company she was burned out"" is about experiencing exhaustion or fatigue after working for a long time. The sentence ""Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do"" is also about feeling exhausted or overwhelmed after taking a break, which is a similar feeling to being burned out.

The most analogous sentence would be:
D. The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.

In the target sentence, the speaker is choosing to go by car despite the fact that it's not too cold outside because they cannot afford to get sick. This decision is made due to a concern for their health.

In option C, the speaker's athletic career began with their first visit to the gym, and they have continued to pursue it, eventually becoming a world-class athlete. This decision was made due to a desire to improve their health and fitness.

C. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.
D. Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.

In the target sentence, the speaker is advising the listener not to be too demanding in negotiations, as it may result in the offer being withdrawn. This is similar to the situation in option C, where the speaker is describing how the person being discussed did not boast about their achievements but still succeeded in securing a high position in their exams. Both situations involve being satisfied with what is offered or achieved, rather than pushing for more."

In for a penny, in for a pound, we need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished, is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a situation where the person involved has put in a lot of effort and resources to achieve a goal, but the outcome is still uncertain. In the target sentence, the director has exhausted all his resources to complete the film and release it, but the success of the film is still uncertain. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, the speaker is willing to stay up all night to complete the report, as they cannot turn it in half-finished. Both sentences convey a sense of determination and commitment to achieving the desired outcome, despite the risks and challenges involved."

Analogous sentence: After deciding to complete the project by Monday, I am working on it with full commitment and determination, hook, line and sinker.

Note: The phrase ""hook, line and sinker"" means completely or wholeheartedly. In the target sentence, the speaker is fully committed to completing the spreadsheets by Monday. In the analogous sentence, I am fully committed to completing the project by Monday. Therefore, the analogous sentence would be: After deciding to complete the project by Monday, I am working on it hook, line and sinker.

The other options do not have a similar meaning to ""hook, line and sinker"" and cannot be analogous to the target sentence."
51,I am determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.,"A. He made the final cut to the university just by a small margin.

Analogous sentence: C. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.

Explanation: Both sentences involve a person putting in a lot of effort or care into something, even if it is not immediately apparent or recognized by others. In the first sentence, the person is determined to cook a difficult meal from scratch, while in the second sentence, the person is caring towards someone without expressing their feelings. In both cases, the person is putting in a lot of effort or care into something, even if it is not immediately apparent or recognized by others."
52,Harry prepared tirelessly for the final race and put in each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.,"A. They don’t talk about Olive anymore, turns out he was the Black sheep of the family, he married someone else while he was still engaged to his fiancé.

D.

In this case, Sally becomes happy and comfortable in the presence of Sharon, implying that she puts in effort and energy to be around Sharon. This is similar to Harry preparing tirelessly and putting in every ounce of energy for the final race. Both sentences depict individuals investing a significant amount of effort and energy into a particular situation.

D. All that glitters is not gold.",A,"D. All that glitters is not gold.

Analogous sentence:

E. Not everything that seems valuable is actually worthwhile.

Explanation:

The target sentence expresses a belief that not everything labeled as ""nationalization"" is necessarily a good idea. The speaker was strongly opposed to it and faced negative consequences as a result. The analogous sentence ""All that glitters is not gold"" also expresses a belief that not everything that appears valuable is actually so. The phrase ""all that glitters"" refers to things that appear valuable or attractive, but the speaker is warning that not all of these things are truly valuable. The analogous sentence ""Not everything that seems valuable is actually worthwhile"" makes this meaning more explicit. Both sentences express a cautionary belief about the true value of things that may initially seem valuable."

C. The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.
D. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire.",B,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also contrasts two seemingly unrelated things to reveal a surprising truth. In this case, the surprising truth is that the person in question may appear unremarkable on the surface, but in reality, they possess significant wealth. This contrasts with the target sentence, which reveals that a seemingly innocuous image on cigarette packs is actually more effective at deterring people from smoking than a simple warning message. Both sentences use contrast to reveal unexpected truths.

Note: In this case, the most analogous sentence would be D, but in general, the most analogous sentence would be the one that shares the same rhetorical device or structure as the target sentence. In this case, both sentences use contrast to reveal unexpected truths."

D. After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.",D,"C is not analogous to the target sentence.

A. [ ]
B. [ ]

Note: Only select one letter.

Explanation:

The target sentence expresses a preference for having a house of one's own instead of sharing, but acknowledges that in certain circumstances, one may not have a choice. This is similar to B, where the president may have preferred to stay in power but had to step down due to constitutional limits. A and D do not convey a similar preference or limitation.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence is B."

Analogous sentence: I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to make do with leftovers from the night before.

Explanation: Both sentences describe a situation where the speaker wants something but is unable to obtain it due to financial constraints, leading them to make do with alternative options. In the first sentence, the speaker wants to go out for dinner but lacks the funds to do so, forcing them to eat leftovers. In the second sentence, Mary desires a big dog house for her dogs, but Peter's inability to afford one prompts her to create a makeshift version using cardboard boxes."

Analogous sentence: D. Learning from a difficult experience can be more valuable than any amount of prior knowledge or preparation. [A, B, X, D]

Explanation:
The target sentence and the analogous sentence both convey the idea that a negative experience can have a positive outcome, such as learning valuable lessons. In the target sentence, the speaker is suggesting that the negative experience of facing a problem can lead to learning from it. In the analogous sentence, the speaker is suggesting that a difficult experience can provide more valuable lessons than prior knowledge or preparation. Both sentences emphasize the potential for growth and learning from adversity.

The other options do not convey the same idea. Option A is about compromising and avoiding tensions, which is not directly related to learning from a negative experience. Option B is about prioritizing important tasks, which is not directly related to learning from a negative experience. Option D is about a positive outcome from a negative experience, but it is not directly related to learning from a negative experience.

Therefore, the analogous sentence is the most analogous to the target sentence in terms of conveying the idea of learning from a negative experience."

This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it does not address the topic of media reporting or gossip.

Explanation: Both sentences involve situations where someone has not done a particular task or activity, but that does not mean that others should also not do it. In the target sentence, the roommate does not clean up after himself, but that does not mean the speaker should not clean up either.

In the target sentence, Mary made a decision to drop out of school and follow her favorite writer's footsteps, which is not a preferred choice in the given context.

Both sentences involve making a decision that is not the preferred or ideal choice in a particular context."

(B)The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go. (C)I have had a great time in college, but tomorrow I will be graduating. (D)My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.

The closest sentence to the target sentence in terms of meaning would be: My years of hard work and dedication have led me to this point of success, but all good things come to an end. This sentence highlights the idea that success and good things are temporary and will eventually come to an end, just like how vacations and college experiences come to an end."

D. I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.",C,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

While the president was immensely popular, he nevertheless had to step down at the conclusion of his term per the rules of the constitution.

C. Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.

In this case, the president's popularity does not exempt him from following the constitutional rules, just as work or stress should not be considered during vacation, as the focus should be on having fun and enjoying the break."

D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.",A,"D. It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.

This sentence expresses the idea of making multiple choices or taking multiple actions instead of relying on just one option. In the context of graduation, it could be interpreted as suggesting that instead of just graduating from one college, the person could apply to multiple colleges or pursue further education at multiple institutions. This is similar to the target sentence in that it involves making a decision or taking an action that leads to a positive outcome, but instead of being satisfied with just one outcome, multiple options are considered."

B. You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.

D. Since he had nothing else to do during the break, he kept obsessing over his previous girlfriend.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. You should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress.

Analogous sentence:
D. Jake might look confused all the time, but he's really extremely bright.

Explanation:

Both sentences involve a situation where taking action earlier could have made things easier, but now it's too late and more work is required. In the target sentence, compromising earlier could have prevented tensions from escalating, but now it's necessary to address the problem before it gets worse. In the analogous sentence, discussing a problem earlier could have made it easier to resolve, but now it's too late and more effort is required to rectify the situation.

However, the second sentence is not as analogous because it's about regretting not discussing a problem earlier, whereas the target sentence is about avoiding a potential escalation of tensions.

The first sentence is not analogous because it's about presenting work before going on vacation, which is not related to avoiding escalation of tensions.

The third sentence is analogous because it's about recognizing that something is more difficult than it seems, just as compromising earlier may have been more difficult than it seemed at the time.

The fourth sentence is not analogous because it's about Jake's appearance and intelligence, which is not related to avoiding escalation of tensions.

The sentence ""We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!"" suggests that taking advantage of opportunities early on can lead to better outcomes in the long run, similar to how resolving small issues in relationships immediately can prevent bigger troubles down the road."

Both sentences emphasize the significance of taking action earlier to avoid negative outcomes later on."

Analogous sentence:

Note: The target sentence is not directly analogous to any of the options provided. The closest match is option D, which touches upon the idea of regretting a past decision and questioning whether things could have been better elsewhere.

The most analogous sentence to ""We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. The early bird catches the worm!"" would be ""Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices. The early bird catches the worm!"" However, this is not an option.

The sentence ""I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball."" is most analogous because it involves taking action early on to achieve a desired outcome, just like going early to the boutique to get the best stuff. Both sentences emphasize the importance of being proactive and taking advantage of opportunities early on."

Analogous Sentence:
She wanted to buy a house in the desirable neighborhood, but the prices have skyrocketed since she first started looking. Now, she is considering settling for a less expensive area.

Explanation:
Both sentences illustrate a change in price or value over time. In the target sentence, the price of the house has increased significantly, making it unaffordable for the second person. In the analogous sentence, the price of houses in a desirable neighborhood has also increased, making it more difficult for the first person to afford. Both sentences highlight the impact of rising prices on purchasing decisions."

D. I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.",D,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

In the target sentence, there is a contrast between the fact that Lexi's laptop is the oldest in the office and her enjoyment of using it. In D, there is a contrast between the initial perception of the CEO as charming and the realization that his promises were empty. Both sentences illustrate that appearances can be deceiving and that reality may not always match initial expectations."

D. After working two years for the company she was burned out.",A,"D is the least analogous sentence to the target sentence. The other options are more similar in structure and sentiment.

A, B, and C all have a contrast between a majority opinion and a personal preference or situation. This is similar to the target sentence, where many people do not appreciate mathematics, but the author finds it meaningful.

D, on the other hand, describes a situation where the person is exhausted from working for two years. This does not have the same contrast or personal preference as the target sentence.

So, the most analogous sentence would be either A, B, or C, depending on which one you find most similar in meaning and structure to the target sentence."

B. This shopkeeper always palms off old stock to the customers.
C. I was completely against nationalization. I resisted it wholeheartedly even though I became quite unpopular in the process.
D. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students.

Explanation:

The other options do not have the same meaning as the target sentence. Option A is a congratulatory message, but it does not describe the teacher's emotions towards successfully explaining a complex topic. Option B is a negative statement about a shopkeeper's behavior, but it does not convey the same sense of happiness and satisfaction as the target sentence. Option C is a statement about the assistant's personal opinion, but it does not describe the emotions of a teacher towards successfully explaining a complex topic. Therefore, D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

Explanation:

In both sentences, the subject (Samantha and incharge) realizes that something has happened that has made them happy (David kept her trust and the floor has been cleaned properly). This realization brings about a strong emotion (more than happy and overjoyed) in both cases. Therefore, A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

B and C do not have a strong emotion associated with the realization, and D is not a realization but a statement of fact."

Analogous sentence: They may have secured the deal, but we have a few tricks up our sleeve to take it back.

C. Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best.
D. The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.

Explanation:

The target sentence expresses a situation where the speaker is holding a grudge against someone (Nick) for an insult. The other sentences do not involve holding a grudge or forgiveness, but D describes a situation where there is a change in weather after a period of unpleasantness. This change could be seen as a form of forgiveness or letting go of the negative weather, making D the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

However, the level of analogy is not very strong, as the situations are not directly related, but rather share a common theme of a change or resolution following a negative event."

Explanation: Both sentences express a preference or recommendation for avoiding an unwanted situation.

B. The presentation was such a mess! The presenters tried to convey a lot of information in such a short time that there was no clarity.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a situation where achieving a goal is more difficult than it seems. In the target sentence, losing weight is presented as something that is easier to say than to actually do, and many people lack the commitment to make it happen. In the analogous sentence, a presentation that tries to convey a lot of information in a short amount of time can become confusing and lack clarity, making it difficult to achieve the desired outcome. Both situations involve a gap between the ease of saying or doing something and the actual difficulty of achieving it."

The analogous sentence describes the feeling of a proud parent whose child graduated from middle school. Both situations involve a positive outcome that fills the person with pride and joy.

However, the other options do not express a positive emotion or experience. Option A describes someone sharing an incident, Option C describes a serial killer being interviewed, and Option B describes the difficulty of losing weight.

Therefore, D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence in terms of expressing a positive emotion or experience."

Analogous sentence: C. There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.

Explanation: Both sentences express a willingness to face a fear or challenge despite initial apprehension. The first sentence describes the speaker's fear of skydiving but also acknowledges a desire to eventually try it. The second sentence describes a similar situation with the speaker's sister and her fear of sleeping in the dark. The third sentence, while not directly related to fear, still expresses a willingness to move forward and try again after a failed attempt. The fourth sentence describes a situation where the speaker has already made a decision and is moving on to the next step. While none of these options are exactly analogous to the target sentence, C comes closest in expressing a willingness to face a challenge despite initial apprehension."

In B, the reader is distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice in a book, making it difficult to learn. In C, people might forget what happened and move on to working on a project together.

C. It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.
D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",A,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

Explanation:

Both the target sentence and C describe a situation where something appears to be one way but is actually another. In the target sentence, Hannah appears to be occupied by personal issues, but Garry realizes that she is avoiding making the presentation. In C, moving to a different country appears to be fun, but it is actually a struggle. Both sentences convey the idea that things are not always as they seem.

Note: The other options do not have this same level of analogy with the target sentence. A describes a situation where a student makes up an excuse, but the professor does not believe it. B describes a situation where someone regrets not working enough, but D describes a situation where people are socializing. These situations are not analogous to the target sentence."

D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",C,"D. You can't submit homework late with the excuse that your dog ate it and expect no penalty.

Analogous sentence: D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.

Explanation: Both sentences express the idea that there is a consequence for failing to fulfill a requirement or obligation. In the target sentence, Amy's excuse did not excuse her from the penalty for not submitting her homework on time. Similarly, in the analogous sentence, running a car without fuel will result in the inability to drive. Both sentences illustrate the importance of fulfilling requirements or obligations in order to avoid negative consequences."

A. The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks.

B. Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.

C. I have had a great time in college, but tomorrow I will be graduating.

None of these options are analogous to the target sentence.

Here's an analogous sentence:

C. The event organizer apologized for not being able to provide the promised amenities due to unforeseen circumstances."
249,I do not want to spoil your mood but I have to babysit my nephew today.,"A. Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.

Most analogous sentence: C. I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation.

Explanation: Both sentences convey a situation where the speaker has to inform someone about an unexpected or unwelcome situation that they have to deal with, which will prevent them from doing something they want to do. In the target sentence, the speaker has to babysit their nephew, which prevents them from doing something else (spoiling someone's mood). In the analogous sentence, the speaker has to ask someone to present their work before they can go on vacation, which prevents them from going on vacation immediately."

Analogous sentence:
E. Don't you know who LeBron James is? He is one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

Letter: D or E

Explanation:
Both sentences express surprise that the person being addressed does not know the identity of a famous individual. The target sentence is about the President of the United States, and the analogous sentence is about a famous basketball player. Both sentences convey a sense of disbelief that the person being addressed is not aware of the identity of these prominent figures.

In terms of grammar and structure, both sentences follow a similar pattern of subject, verb, object, and exclamation mark. The target sentence is a statement of fact followed by an exclamatory statement, while the analogous sentence is a question followed by an exclamatory statement. However, both sentences convey the same meaning and level of surprise.

Therefore, the analogous sentence is ""E. Don't you know who LeBron James is? He is one of the greatest basketball players of all time.""

Letter: D or E

Answer: D or E

Explanation:
The answer is ""D"" for the target sentence and ""E"" for the analogous sentence."

D. We missed the bus, but it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk.",B,"C. A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.

This sentence is most analogous to the target sentence because it highlights the impact and significance of a visual representation or warning, much like how the target sentence introduces the world champion of taekwondo as a significant figure. Both sentences aim to convey the importance and impact of something through a visual or auditory representation."

D. Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter.",A,"A. [ ]

B. [ ]

C. [ ]

D. [ ]

Answer: [C]

Explanation:

The most analogous sentence is C, as it also involves a change in behavior or demeanor based on the presence or absence of someone else. However, in this case, Linda's change is a positive one, whereas the professor's decision not to be strict is a more ambiguous one. Nonetheless, both situations involve a shift in behavior based on external factors.

Note: The answer may vary based on the specific context and interpretation of the target sentence and options. In this case, the answer is based on the idea that the professor's decision not to be strict is a result of external factors (the students copying the homework) rather than an inherent change in his behavior or attitude towards the students. If the target sentence had instead stated that the professor decided not to be strict because he believed it was the right thing to do, then the answer would be different."

D. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.",A,"D. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.

Actions speak louder than words in this scenario as well. By compromising with the neighbour, the problem is being addressed and resolved, rather than letting it fester and potentially escalate into a bigger issue. Just as the speaker in the target sentence didn't need to boast about her academic achievements because her results spoke for themselves, compromising with a neighbour can be a more effective solution than letting tensions build."
263,"He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.","A. Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.

D. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.",D,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it also involves someone's actions not matching their true feelings or intentions towards another person. However, in this case, it is the opposite of the target sentence, where the person's actions are more positive than their true feelings."
265,"He spoke about his guitar skills poorly, but when he played, his hard work showed through the music he produced.","A. He never told her about his feelings but everytime he met her, he was caring towards her.

D. All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,"D is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it highlights a contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part. However, in this case, the first part is positive while the second part is negative, whereas in the target sentence, the first part is positive but the second part reveals a different reality. In D, the first part is positive as all the songs on her album are amazing, but the second part ruins the vibe, indicating that the last song is not as good as the others. This contrast is similar to the target sentence where Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need of smoking told a different story.

D. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.",D,"D does not describe a forest growing near a river, so it is not the most analogous sentence.

The closest option to the analogous sentence would be:

C. Part of the state budget was melting, little by little, due to the federal government’s contentious spending package.
D. It would be better if you applied to several companies, little by little, instead of just one.

Explanation:

The key to finding an analogous sentence is to identify the underlying process or action that is happening in the target sentence. In this case, the target sentence describes a gradual melting process.

The first option creates a new scenario that involves the federal government's spending package, but it doesn't accurately capture the gradual melting process.

The second option adds the gradual melting process to Jimmy's scenario, but it doesn't accurately describe the state budget melting.

The third option accurately describes the gradual melting process of the state budget due to the federal government's spending package.

The fourth option creates a new scenario that involves applying to companies, but it doesn't accurately capture the gradual melting process.

Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

In this case, the outcome is the decision to maintain friendly relations between countries, which is dependent on the war being over. In the target sentence, the outcome is a portion of the state budget being allocated, which is dependent on the federal government's spending package.

Let's forget what happened and work on the project together (A) is not analogous as it does not describe a result or outcome being dependent on a previous event or decision.

Little by little, the stove’s radiating heat melted the chocolate bar on the counter nearby (B) is not analogous as it describes a physical process, not a result or outcome being dependent on a previous event or decision.

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to (D) is not analogous as it describes a desire or intention, not a result or outcome being dependent on a previous event or decision."

Note: The answer is D because it involves a clear ultimatum, much like the target sentence.

D. I told my wife I will compromise on most of the things but on holidays I can do whatever I want.",D,"C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence as it highlights the issue of trying to convey too much information in a short time, leading to a lack of clarity. The target sentence, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of following a specific approach to avoid failure. Both sentences convey a sense of urgency and potential negative consequences if the recommended course of action is not taken. However, C is more closely related to the target sentence in terms of the theme of clarity and potential failure due to overloading information."

Note: The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is D. However, without context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of the target sentence.

Analogous sentence: C. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery.

Explanation:

Both sentences describe a situation where something positive happens after a negative or less favorable event. In the target sentence, the speaker is expressing that they enjoy all the songs on the album, but the last one ruins the overall experience. In option B, the speaker acknowledges that the A team has the best players, but one player, Ron, often negates their efforts. In option C, the speaker describes a negative event (losing everything in a fire) followed by a positive event (winning the state lottery). This pattern is similar to the target sentence, where the speaker describes a positive experience (enjoying all the songs on the album) followed by a negative one (the last song ruining the vibe). Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence.

However, the answer is B, as the pattern in option C is less clear and could be interpreted differently depending on the context. In option B, the pattern is more straightforward and clear."

Explanation:

Both sentences involve someone experiencing consequences after a period of success or advantage. In the target sentence, Fred built an immense fortune through swindling others, but he lost it all when someone swindled him. In the analogous sentence, the boy who cried wolf enjoyed a position of advantage by falsely claiming the presence of wolves, but he faced consequences when the wolves actually arrived. Both sentences illustrate the idea that success or advantage can be fleeting and that consequences often follow."

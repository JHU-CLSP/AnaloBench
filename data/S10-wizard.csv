0,All that glitters is not gold.,"In the small town of Baker's Crest, people lived simple lives, mostly untouched by the allure of wealth and luxury. The quiet town was buzzing one day with the news of a travelling merchant who claimed to sell ""real gold"" artifacts. The townspeople gathered at the market square, attracted by the glinting objects displayed on his cart. 

The items glittered under the sunlight, their sheen unmatched, making everyone believe they were indeed made of gold. The merchant, a persuasive man, told captivating tales of the artifacts being lost treasures of ancient kings. An air of greed and desire blew over the town, as everyone wanted a piece of this assumed wealth. They traded their hard-earned savings for the glittering items, believing they had struck a fortune. 

It was not until a wise old man from the town examined the artifacts closely and declared them to be mere brass, cleverly polished to resemble gold. All the glitter had indeed fooled them, reinforcing the adage, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The realization dawned, leaving the townspeople embarrassed, having learned their lesson the hard way.","A. Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy. 

However, one day, she stumbled upon an article with the title: ""Don't trust everything on social media."" Intrigued, Emily delved deeper. The article pointed out that many posts on social media are often enhanced, staged, or even completely fake. It pointed out the ubiquity of photo-editing apps and deceitful captions used by people to portray a better version of their lives. The realization hit Emily like a ton of bricks.

From that day forward, Emily took every glamorous post she saw with a grain of salt, knowing they could be far removed from reality. She no longer allowed herself to be bogged down by the apparent euphoria exhibited by others online, instead focusing on building her own contentment in the real world. It was a simple reminder, but one that brought her a great deal of peace: social media is a deceptive lens, and life behind the screen isn't always as perfect as it seems.
B. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.
C. Upon the release of the school's basketball team list, Tim was devastated to find his name absent from the roster. His hopes had been high, his dreams of playing as a power forward crashing down as reality set in - he hadn't made the cut. As he stood there in front of the gym, the basketball in his hand felt like a weight. His friends, other aspiring athletes, tried to console him, but their words were like hollow echoes in his disappointed mind. 

Barry, an older and wise friend who had graduated two years prior, happened to be visiting the school that day. He noticed Tim's gloomy expression and inquired about his sorrow. After hearing Tim's story, he shared his sympathetic understanding. However, Barry also offered him words of encouragement and wisdom. He advised Tim to stray away from his emotions, to not let this setback define him but instead to use it as motivation to work harder. Barry instilled hope in Tim, reminding him that there was always next year's tryout and an opportunity to come back stronger than ever.
D. Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest adorned with lush green trees, there stood a magnificent oak tree, the oldest and tallest among them. Its grandeur and magnificent aura provided shade and shelter to countless creatures. One fateful night, a storm ravaged the forest, severely damaging many of the trees. The relentless winds managed to fell the grand oak tree, it's mighty fall echoed throughout the forest. 

Come the morning, the woodland inhabitants were in for a shock. The vast expanse that once thrived under the shade of the grand oak was now exposed to the scorching sun. A fallen tree, it was realized, cannot provide shade, a sentiment that echoed through every creature's heart. The squirrels, the birds, the insects, all missed the comforting shade they once called home. 

This realization marked a turning point in the lives of the forest dwellers. Despite the loss of their beloved tree, they understood the power of change, even if it was painful. And in the grand oak's memory, they grew stronger, embracing the sunlight with resilience, and learned to adapt to their new environment.",A,"#1 New York Times, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, 2036, 2037"
1,The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks.,"From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.","A. Jake might look confused all the time, his eyebrows perpetually furrowed, his gaze constantly lost somewhere far beyond the present. Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.
B. Sharon and Mark were once a picture-perfect couple, deeply in love, admired by everyone around them for their romantic bond. But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce, learning every day that love and understanding always have the power to conquer even the toughest situations.
C. For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.
D. Juli had always been fond of a particular towering oak tree in their backyard. It had been her favorite spot to read, and she had spent countless hours nestled in its sturdy branches. Then one day, a violent storm swept through their town, uprooting the mighty tree Juli loved so much. When Juli saw the tree in its fallen state, her heart ached with a sorrow that she could not put into words.

Understanding her sorrow, her father, who was a gifted artist, decided to immortalize the tree in a way only he could. He spent days working tirelessly, capturing every detail from the gnarled roots to the endless branches that had once reached towards the heavens. When he was done, he presented the painting to Juli with an apologetic smile.

He told her, ""There's nothing else we could do, Juli,"" his words full of empathy for his daughter's loss. The painting was a spectacular rendition of her favorite tree, standing tall and mighty just like how she remembered it. Juli found solace in her father's gift and realized that even though the tree had physically vanished from their backyard, it would forever remain alive in her heart and her father's masterpiece.",A,"s and the 1980s.

2,"The journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like.","The journalist, Richard, had always admired the life of the famous actress, Marianne, from afar. He thought her life was extraordinary, filled with glitz, glamour, and excitement. He imagined her attending exclusive parties, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood elites, and living the high life. One day, he was given an exclusive assignment to write a feature about Marianne's lifestyle.

He was exhilarated and prepared for a deep dive into an extravagant lifestyle. To his surprise, he found Marianne lived a very ordinary life, far removed from what he had envisioned. The glitz and glamour were reserved only for the camera; her real-life was more of sweatpants, books, and quiet nights with her old cat.

She preferred staying at home, cooking her meals, and working on her own scripts. She stayed away from industry parties, citing them as shallow and draining. Richard, after spending a week following her, realized that the life of the famous actress was not as extraordinary as it seemed on the glossy magazine covers; it was far more grounded and normal than he could have ever imagined.","A. Harry Richardson, a savvy and seasoned politician, had spent his life mastering the art of political maneuvering. His charisma and charm were unmatched, but this time, he was facing a formidable opponent in the upcoming election, John Duncan. Though seemingly plain, Duncan's honesty and transparent policies were rapidly gaining popular appeal. It seemed as though the competition was going to be tougher than Harry had initially anticipated. 

Behind closed doors, Harry had crafted a secret plan, a wild card that he was certain would tip the scales in his favor. Weeks before the election, he received an anonymous tip about a scandal involving Duncan. He had spent painstaking hours verifying the information, ensuring not to leave any room for errors. At the last possible moment, just days before the election, he made his move.

In a televised press conference, Harry revealed the scandalous secret about Duncan involving financial fraud. The shocking revelation sent waves through the entire nation, causing a significant shift in public opinion. The scales indeed tipped and Harry was once again, thanks to his secret plan, the people's choice for leadership.
B. Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.
C. At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.
D. On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.",B,"#include <iostream>

3,The charming so-called CEO later proved to be the wrong choice to make a deal with. Turns out his promises were only empty words.,"Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.","A. Seeing my old friend Mark after so long, I was ecstatic to hear that his child had reached a significant milestone. ""Wow, your kid just graduated middle school!"" I exclaimed, hardly believing how much time had passed since our own school days. 

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.
B. Jacob sat down next to me at our favorite local café, an anxious look stretched across his face. He was contemplating a big decision - an opportunity to move across the country for a new job. I looked at him, sipping my coffee, and said, ""You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.""

He looked puzzled, not fully understanding what I meant. I explained further, ""Think about it, Jacob. Here, you know the market, you have your network, and the comfort of your home. This familiarity provides you with more options and opportunities."" 

Suddenly, his anxious look eased a bit. He knew the decision wouldn't be easy, but the wisdom behind the advice resonated with him. Jacob decided to dedicate himself to the opportunities at hand, vowing to work harder and seize every chance before making the big move. He understood then that once he moved, everything would change, and he needed to prepare for that inevitability.
C. Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy.

D. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.",C,"# A

4,Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.,"When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.","A. Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.
B. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
C. My sister, Emily, has a deeply ingrained fear of the dark that traces back to our childhood. As children, we would share ghost stories late at night, and Emily would always end up shaken, her imagination running wild. She was so petrified that she always left the hallway light on before going to sleep, casting a faint glow into her room. It was her way of dealing with the fear of what lurked in the darkness. 

But as we grew older, Emily decided that she could no longer allow her fear to dictate her life. She often spoke of her desire to one day sleep in a completely dark room, without the safety of the light from the hallway. It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.
D. Lily was the kind of person who was always running around trying to help others. She had an exceptional kind heart, always lending a hand, lending an ear, and giving out pieces of her heart to those in need. Her friends, family, and even sometimes strangers benefited from her tireless dedication to making people's lives better. However, Lily often neglected her own needs. 

One day, her close friend, Maria, noticed the tiredness in Lily's eyes. She was a shadow of her bubbly self, a clear indication she was drained. Maria gently reminded her, ""Lily, you can't pour from an empty cup."" 

Lily looked puzzled, so Maria explained, ""You give so much of yourself, but you can't forget to replenish your own energy."" Maria reminded Lily about the importance of self-care, of setting boundaries and ensuring her own cup was filled before she attempted to fill others. It was a lesson Lily took to heart, finally understanding that she couldn't effectively help others if she herself was running on empty.",A,"s, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, the, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the"
5,Mary often boasted of her rose garden to be the best garden in the city. But in reality it is nothing but ordinary.,"Mary was known in her quaint town not just for her cheerful demeanor, but also for her extensive rose garden. She was incredibly proud of it and often boasted that her rose garden was the best in the entire city. She would lovingly prune the roses every day, her hand skimming over the vibrant hues with a sense of satisfaction and adoration. 

However, anyone who visited Mary's place would be far from impressed. To the outsider's eye, Mary's garden was nothing but ordinary. The roses were indeed beautiful, but they were the common variety that could be found anywhere in the city. 

Her rose bushes were not meticulously manicured, and the arrangement of her plants lacked imagination. There were no benches or fountains, nor were there any artistic sculptures that were often seen in other local gardens. The paths were not lined with charming pebbles, and there was no pergola under which one could rest.

In reality, Mary's garden, despite her pride and joy, was just like any other in the city. But in her eyes, the love and time she invested made it the most extraordinary garden of all.","A. My heart skips a beat every time I imagine myself skydiving. The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.
C. On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.
D. Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. He had several lucrative offers from other employers who were impressed by his skills and potential, but he declined them all. He was a man on a mission, determined to become part of Frank’s company, irrespective of the role he had to take up.

He reached out to Frank multiple times, explaining his passion, but never received a response. Larry, however, was not disheartened. He persisted, continually improving his skills and hoping that someday, he would get the opportunity to work with his idol, unswayed by the tempting offers that could have led him down a different path.",B,C.
6,Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.,"Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.","A. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire. Meet James Harrison, a self-made millionaire who lives in New York City. He made his fortune in the tech industry but chose to remain humble and unassuming despite his wealth. 

Every morning, he puts on the same attire: a plain black t-shirt, khaki pants, and worn-out sneakers. To the average eye, he appears to be just another face in the crowd. He spends his days not in opulent boardrooms, but rather in quaint cafes, where he is always absorbed in either a novel or his laptop, ever curious and eager to learn. 

James prefers solitude and discretion over the fanfare associated with high society. He believes that true worth isn't measured by the price tag on your clothes but by the richness of your character and the value you bring to society. At the end of the day, James Harrison, in his simple clothes, is far more than a millionaire; he's a millionaire with a purpose.
B. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter. This wasn't just any letter, it was a letter of apology that took me countless drafts and revisions to get just right. I'd been wrestling with my feelings for so long, knowing I had wronged a dear friend and not knowing how to mend the damage.

Night after night, I poured my thoughts and remorse onto paper, only to crumple it up and throw it away. The words never seemed to adequately express my regret. The sense of shame and guilt gnawed at my conscience every day. I was on edge, wondering if the friendship I had ruined would ever be salvaged.

Finally, after two grueling weeks, I had a version I was somewhat satisfied with. I remember walking to the post office with a trembling hand, slipping the envelope into the mailbox, feeling a strange sense of relief mixed with apprehension. I knew I had done my part in seeking forgiveness, and all that was left was to hope my friend would understand.
C. Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.
D. Living in the small northern town of Kjørnes, Norway, the residents understood the value of sunlight more than anyone else. It's a stark difference between the sunny days of summer and the fleeting daylight of the harsh winter. Hence, they were always thankful for the sunshine that graced their town during the brief but beautiful summer. The phrase, ""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter,"" echoed in every gathering, reminding everyone to soak in as much sun as they possibly could.

This summer was no exception. As the sun rose in the bright blue sky, children would rush out of their homes to play, their laughter ringing through the peaceful town. The adults spent their time gardening, enjoying the feeling of warmth on their skin. Barbecues, picnics, and sunbathing became the town's pastime, bringing a vibrant energy that only came with the summer sunshine.

However, as the days began to shorten, a sense of urgency hung in the air. They knew that they needed to cherish every sunbeam, every light-filled day, as they would soon retreat to a world of ice and darkness. Regardless, they remained resilient, embracing the inevitable winter, while always looking forward to the next summer’s sunshine.",A,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.
B. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.
C. I've been cooking for the majority of my life, and over the years, I've accumulated an impressive array of cooking utensils. Some of them are shiny and new, flaunting an array of fancy features. Lately, there's been a new utensil in the market that's been getting quite a buzz; it's sleek, multifunctional, and apparently worth the hefty price tag. Even so, I'm not tempted.

To me, nothing can replace my old pan. It's a simple, nondescript thing, with a worn-out handle and the faint traces of countless meals. It's this pan that has been my trusty companion in preparing countless family meals and festive feasts. The new utensil may have the latest features, but it does not have the countless memories attached to it. 

Yes, my pan may be old, it may not be the shiniest, or have the latest features, but it's dependable. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.
D. Dr. Smith, the chemistry professor at Northwood University, sat quietly in his office preparing to deliver some unfortunate news. He had been grading papers all morning when he'd noticed a peculiar mistake in his register. One of his top students, Anna, had been marked as having scored an A in Chemistry. Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.",A,"2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2039, 2040, 2041, 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049, 2050, 2051, 2052, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2062, 2063, 2064, 2065, 2066, 2067"
8,"Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.","Although Lexi looks like an airhead, with her constantly changing hair color and an inexplicable love for oversized, flashy accessories, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met. Her quirky appearance always manages to take people by surprise when she voices her thoughts. We first crossed paths at a local café, where Lexi was wearing a sunflower crown and sporting a bright blue hair. I remember overhearing her conversation with the elderly man at the next table, about the geopolitical ramifications of a recent election.

Even though her flashy appearance said otherwise, her intellect and insight were evident in her every word. Lexi's wisdom extends beyond politics. She can, in one moment, discuss the finer points of classical literature, then easily switch to explaining the complexities of quantum physics or debating the abstract philosophies of life. 

Being around her, I began to understand the depth of her knowledge and the breadth of her understanding. It was a lesson to not judge someone by their appearance, because here was Lexi, vibrant and quirky, yet full of wisdom that could put the wisest of scholars to shame. Despite her exterior portraying her as an airhead, Lexi has, and continues to be, a paragon of wisdom and intellect to me.","A. The boss of the packaging factory, Mr. Harrison, was known for his demanding work ethic. For him, the productivity of his factory was the top priority. So he set a rule for his workers: a minimum of 20 hours a week, no exceptions.

However, this rule wasn't welcomed warmly by the workers. The weekly shift was interfering with their personal lives and creating a stressful work environment. They protested against the rule, asking for more flexibility.

But Mr. Harrison didn't heed their concerns. Instead, he retorted, ""If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit."" This statement left the workers aghast. They were left pondering on the tough choice between their job and their well-being.
B. Garry had always admired Hannah's skills as an analyst, but he couldn't ignore the recent change in her behavior. She had always been the one to volunteer for presentations and company seminars, her confidence and eloquence leaving everyone impressed. But the past few weeks had been different. Her regular enthusiasm seemed to be drained, her willing participation turning into subtle avoidance.

One day, Garry overheard Hannah speaking on the phone in hushed tones, expressing her anxiety about an upcoming presentation to a friend. From that moment, he realized her avoidance wasn't just mere coincidence. It seemed as if Hannah was avoiding making the presentation by pretending to be occupied by personal issues.

Garry understood that everyone had their highs and lows, but he did not want Hannah to use this as a scapegoat to escape her responsibilities. He decided that if she continued with this behavior, he would have to have a word with her. He planned to approach her about it, hoping that some form of a solution could be worked out, if indeed, she was going through a tough time.
C. In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

The town's elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, regularly visited his store for their weekly groceries. They were often the victims of his ploys, ending up with half-rotten tomatoes and stale bread more often than not. But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business. The residents of the small coastal town continued to buy from him - some out of convenience, others out of habit.
D. When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.",D,s and the other day after that the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the others day after the others day after the others day after the others day after the others day after the others night after the others night after the others day after the others week after the others month after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others year after the others Year after the others year after the others Year after

In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.
B. Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.

D. Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it.

Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.","A. John and his wife, Liza, had long awaited the arrival of a little one. Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

Liza would often find him sitting quietly in the room, staring at the beautifully painted walls with a distant look in his eyes. But no matter what the adoption agency's decision turned out to be, John was determined that the room would not go in vain, it would be a sanctuary of hope, a testament to their love and longing for a child.
B. I have always been one to admire bold, vibrant colours. Deep reds, cobalt blues and vibrant oranges that make a statement, that catch your eye even from afar. You, on the other hand, decided to get a soft muted beige car, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.

""I don’t really like the colour of your car,"" I remember saying to you one sunny afternoon, as we sat on the porch, sipping on homemade lemonade. I even pointed to your car, parked at the curb, as if you didn't know which one I was referring to.

You laughed, a soft chuckle that had me smirking, before setting down your glass on the table. ""I figured as much,"" you responded, a teasing glint in your eyes. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.""

I had to concede, knowing you had a point. After all, you were always drawn to the softer, subtler things in life, that found beauty in simplicity, and it was one of the many reasons I adored you. So although I may not have agreed with your choice of car colour, I could still appreciate why you chose it. It was, after all, very you.
C. There are days when I'm knee-deep in paperwork and plagued by a series of never-ending office meetings that a thought crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Perhaps then, I would be researching in a lab or writing a thesis, far removed from the politics and monotony of corporate life. 

I often find myself imagining a life in an academic institution surrounded by books and great minds, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Those thoughts often come wrapped in a sense of regret, along with an acute sense of longing for a path I did not choose. And it's not just about escaping my current predicament, it's about doing something fulfilling and being a part of something bigger. 

However, I must admit that I might have romanticized the whole concept of pursuing a higher degree. The late nights working on a research paper, the pressure to publish, the uncertainty of grants and fellowships – these are aspects I conveniently overlook while daydreaming. Besides, having spent a significant amount of time in a corporate setting, I have gained practical knowledge and insights that an academic path might not have provided. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side, and it's easy to long for what we don't have while ignoring the value of what we do have.
D. At the prestigious Bellington University, a group of four science students were assigned a complex project that was to be presented in front of the entire class. Two weeks before the presentation, one member of the team, Jason, received news that his grandmother was critically ill. Despite his personal issues, Jason continued to contribute to the project to the best of his abilities. To ease Jason's stress, the group decided to concoct a small lie, stating that Jason was out of town visiting ailing relatives. They hoped this would exempt them from the presentation, allowing them to simply turn in the paper instead.

On the day of the meeting, one of the group members casually informed their professor, Dr. Sanders, about Jason's unexpected absence. However, Dr. Sanders, with his years of experience and knack for reading his students, discerned the fib. Coincidentally, he had seen Jason at the library earlier that day, working on the project. With the truth in sight, Dr. Sanders decided not to confront the group about their deception. Instead, he made the choice to deduct marks on their project, teaching them a valuable lesson about honesty and integrity in academia.",C,s and the 190s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the
11,"Don't trust everything on the social media. It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.","Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy. 

However, one day, she stumbled upon an article with the title: ""Don't trust everything on social media."" Intrigued, Emily delved deeper. The article pointed out that many posts on social media are often enhanced, staged, or even completely fake. It pointed out the ubiquity of photo-editing apps and deceitful captions used by people to portray a better version of their lives. The realization hit Emily like a ton of bricks.

From that day forward, Emily took every glamorous post she saw with a grain of salt, knowing they could be far removed from reality. She no longer allowed herself to be bogged down by the apparent euphoria exhibited by others online, instead focusing on building her own contentment in the real world. It was a simple reminder, but one that brought her a great deal of peace: social media is a deceptive lens, and life behind the screen isn't always as perfect as it seems.","A. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.
B. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.
C. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.
D. John had a clear goal in mind when he stepped onto the college campus for the first time; he wanted to land a good job after graduation. He understood that achieving this goal would require more than just passing his exams; he'd need to fully dedicate himself to his studies. Determined to succeed, he tirelessly hit the books every day, absorbing as much knowledge as he could from his professors.

Along the way, he was compelled to make several sacrifices. Socializing with friends often took a backseat, as John prioritized his studies above everything else. Long nights that should've been spent enjoying his youth were instead devoted to honing his skills and expanding his knowledge. 

Weekend trips, parties, and late-night hangouts were turned down, only fueling his reputation as the hardworking and focused individual. His hard work, however, did not go unnoticed. His professors often praised him for his diligence, with some even predicting a promising future for him in his chosen field.

In the end, his perseverance paid off. John graduated at the top of his class and managed to land a lucrative job in a prestigious company. His college years may have been spent mostly with his nose buried in books, but he knew that every sacrifice he made was worth the success he had achieved.",C,"D.

12,"Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.","There are days when I'm knee-deep in paperwork and plagued by a series of never-ending office meetings that a thought crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Perhaps then, I would be researching in a lab or writing a thesis, far removed from the politics and monotony of corporate life. 

I often find myself imagining a life in an academic institution surrounded by books and great minds, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Those thoughts often come wrapped in a sense of regret, along with an acute sense of longing for a path I did not choose. And it's not just about escaping my current predicament, it's about doing something fulfilling and being a part of something bigger.

Ever since my childhood, I've been told that every cloud has a silver lining. The truth of that adage never really struck me until a rainy day last June. My wife, Cindy, and I were supposed to catch an early morning flight for our anniversary getaway. However, due to an unforeseen traffic jam, we missed our flight and found ourselves stranded in the bustling terminal.

At first, we were fraught with frustration and disappointment, the holiday we planned so meticulously was slipping away. Yet, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. While waiting at the crowded coffee shop inside the airport, we crossed paths with a kind old man named Charlie.

We started talking and found out that Charlie was a veteran and had led a life full of adventures. He shared stories from his travels around the world, his life lessons, and his wisdom. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met Charlie, and our world would be a little less enriched. His stories and experiences, his wisdom and his kindness became the unexpected highlight of our anniversary.
B. For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.
C. When some people see my Instagram feed, the beautiful snapshots of foreign landscapes and exotic food, they always say, ""It looks like fun."" And yes, there are moments that are incredibly exciting and fulfilling. But there's an untold reality to this adventurous facade that often gets overlooked. In reality, it is a struggle to move to a different country. 

It’s not just about adjusting to the new scenery or getting lost in translation. It's the deep-rooted homesickness that never seems to go away. It's missing your family's comfort, your friends' laughter, and the familiarity of your home. It’s the feeling of alienation while trying to fit in a culture so different from your own. 

So while you may look at my life and see an unending vacation, remember to count your blessings. The stability, comfort, and sense of belonging that comes with being home is a privilege not everyone enjoys. Cherishing that is more important than any far-flung adventure.
D. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.",C,s and the 20s and the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3s the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3 the 3
13,The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.,"Once, there was an accomplished lawyer named Robert. He was highly respected in his field, winning cases with an uncanny ease and expertise. However, he grew tired of the endless lawsuits, the constant debating, and the late-night preparation for trials. He yearned for a drastic change, something that could offer him a chance at a different lifestyle.

One day, Robert made a decision that shocked his colleagues. He quit his prestigious job as a lawyer and decided to return to university to obtain an MBA degree. He believed this degree would offer him better job opportunities and a less stressful life. The idea of working within a corporate environment, negotiating deals, and creating business strategies excited him.

However, his aspirations soon met with a harsh reality. After graduating, he found himself lost in an oversaturated job market, struggling to find a place where his new skill set would be valued as much as his old one. He began to realize that every career had its challenges, and it wasn't about chasing what seemed to be better, but rather, finding contentment in what one already has. His journey to become an MBA graduate, although enlightening, did not provide the solution he had hoped for.","A. Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.
B. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, lived a young artist named Alex. He was full of aspirations, with an insatiable desire for success in his artistic endeavors. One day, he got an offer from a renowned gallery to showcase his works. His old and wise mentor, Robert, was ecstatic to hear this news. 

Seeing the glittering greed in Alex's eyes, Robert cautioned, ""Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you."" He emphasized the gravity of his statement by adding, ""If you negotiate too much they might take the offer back."" Alex, blinded by his greed, dismissed Robert's wise advice as the fear of an old man.

However, his relentless negotiation with the gallery didn't go well. The gallery management, unimpressed with his unabashed greed, withdrew their offer. Alex, left with regret and an invaluable lesson, realized the wisdom in Robert's words: modesty sometimes had its rewards.
C. John had been training for months for his first marathon. He was no stranger to running, but marathons were an entirely new ballgame. His coach had given him one primary advice, ""Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon,"" he had said. 

John remembered his words clearly. He felt the thrill of the starting gunshot echoing in his ears. An impulse surged through him to dash off with the crowd, but he reined in his energy. He had trained hard and didn't want to waste his endurance in the first few miles. 

Instead, he started at a manageable pace. As he passed each mile, he slowly increased his speed. This strategy kept him fresh even in the later stages of the race, and as he crossed the finish line, he knew he had done it right. His adherence to maintaining a steady pace and avoiding a rapid start paid off. The joy of completion paired with a decent time made all his efforts worthwhile. His first marathon was a success, all thanks to his wise pacing.
D. The journalist, Richard, had always admired the life of the famous actress, Marianne, from afar. He thought her life was extraordinary, filled with glitz, glamour, and excitement. He imagined her attending exclusive parties, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood elites, and living the high life. One day, he was given an exclusive assignment to write a feature about Marianne's lifestyle.

He was exhilarated and prepared for a deep dive into an extravagant lifestyle. To his surprise, he found Marianne lived a very ordinary life, far removed from what he had envisioned. The glitz and glamour were reserved only for the camera; her real-life was more of sweatpants, books, and quiet nights with her old cat.

She preferred staying at home, cooking her meals, and working on her own scripts. She stayed away from industry parties, citing them as shallow and draining. Richard, after spending a week following her, realized that the life of the famous actress was not as extraordinary as it seemed on the glossy magazine covers; it was far more grounded and normal than he could have ever imagined.",D,
14,John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.,"John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.","A. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.
B. Jake might look confused all the time, his eyebrows perpetually furrowed, his gaze constantly lost somewhere far beyond the present. Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.
C. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
D. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.",B,"the

15,It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.,"When some people see my Instagram feed, the beautiful snapshots of foreign landscapes and exotic food, they always say, ""It looks like fun."" And yes, there are moments that are incredibly exciting and fulfilling. But there's an untold reality to this adventurous facade that often gets overlooked. In reality, it is a struggle to move to a different country. 

It’s not just about adjusting to the new scenery or getting lost in translation. It's the deep-rooted homesickness that never seems to go away. It's missing your family's comfort, your friends' laughter, and the familiarity of your home. It’s the feeling of alienation while trying to fit in a culture so different from your own. 

So while you may look at my life and see an unending vacation, remember to count your blessings. The stability, comfort, and sense of belonging that comes with being home is a privilege not everyone enjoys. Cherishing that is more important than any far-flung adventure.","A. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
B. John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.

D. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade.

Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.","A. When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.
B. Lake Erie is a beautiful and serene body of water, located in the northern part of the United States. This vast expanse of water is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from all corners of the world. Yet, one of the most fascinating aspects of Lake Erie is not just its beauty, but the role it plays in the complex and fascinating hydrological system of the Great Lakes.

Lake Erie drains its waters into another of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario. This transition of waters occurs via an extraordinary body of water, the Niagara River. The river is relatively short, merely 36 miles long, but plays an essential role in the transfer of waters between these two Great Lakes.

However, the journey from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not a simple, direct flow. The waters pass through a remarkable natural spectacle, the Niagara Falls. The thunderous roar of the Falls and the misty aura created by the falling water is a mesmerizing sight.

This journey of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is more than a geographical process. It serves as an embodiment of the dynamism and interconnectedness of nature. Above all, it's a reminder of the impermanence of things and the constancy of change, as the waters of Lake Erie perpetually flow into Lake Ontario, continuing the endless cycle of life.
C. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
D. I've been cooking for the majority of my life, and over the years, I've accumulated an impressive array of cooking utensils. Some of them are shiny and new, flaunting an array of fancy features. Lately, there's been a new utensil in the market that's been getting quite a buzz; it's sleek, multifunctional, and apparently worth the hefty price tag. Even so, I'm not tempted.

To me, nothing can replace my old pan. It's a simple, nondescript thing, with a worn-out handle and the faint traces of countless meals. It's this pan that has been my trusty companion in preparing countless family meals and festive feasts. The new utensil may have the latest features, but it does not have the countless memories attached to it. 

Yes, my pan may be old, it may not be the shiniest, or have the latest features, but it's dependable. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.",A,
17,She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.,"Every day when she woke up, Jennifer looked through her window and admired her neighbor's home. She thought it was more attractive than her own whenever she turned to look at it. It was a resplendent Victorian mansion with an abundance of gables, a porch that wrapped around the entire front, and immaculate, manicured hedges that lined the driveway. There were vibrantly colored flowers placed expertly throughout the garden, and the white picket fence added an element of charm that she felt her own home lacked.

Jennifer's house, a modest bungalow, was far from unappealing, but paled in comparison to her neighbor's palatial abode. She spent countless hours fussing over her humble garden and undertaking DIY projects to make her home look more like the one across the street. Yet her efforts seemed to fall short every time.

One day, Jennifer struck up a conversation with her neighbor, Ms. Hawthorne. The older woman shared that the upkeep of her lavish home was quite demanding, requiring daily maintenance, considerable expenditure, and constant attention to detail. In that moment, Jennifer realized that while the neighbor's home may have been more attractive, it was certainly more difficult to keep up. She learned to appreciate her own home's charm, realizing its lower maintenance was a blessing in disguise.","A. John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.
B. For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.
C. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always had an insatiable curiosity for the world. My parents tried to answer my million questions, but they often found it hard to explain certain concepts to me. Then, they began showing me pictures and drawings, and that was when my understanding grew. I remember distinctly, the drawing that introduced me to the concept of the solar system.

The drawing showed me at one glance, what a book could only show me in many pages. At first glance, I saw colorful planets orbiting a radiant sun, each with their own distinct patterns and sizes. The earth, a blue dot, placed third from the sun made me comprehend our position in the universe. The distinct rings of Saturn, the redness of Mars, the size of Jupiter, all seemed to tell their own story.

Those simple illustrations sparked a fascination in me for the cosmos and it was far more effective than any description in a book. Thus, a picture became my stepping stone to the infinite world of knowledge, proving that sometimes, one glance can offer insight a thousand words may fail to give.
D. Linda had always been a reserved woman, with her emotions often kept in check and concealed beneath a cordial smile. However, she was different in her own home, especially when she was around her husband, Tom. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around; her stiff exterior softens, her subtle smile widens, and her eyes brighten.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.",A,"```

18,After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb.,"In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

Veins popped out from his neck as his anger intensified, and his voice echoed like thunder through the silent streets. The crowd around them flinched at his every word, each one sharper and harsher than the last. His rage had controlled him, made him a roaring lion amongst the frightened lambs. But, after spewing out his frustrations, Gerald's storm slowly began to calm. 

He felt a heaviness lift from his chest as he expelled his rage, his mind clearing like the sky after a tempest. After letting off his rage, he sat down like a lamb, his once roaring demeanor replaced with a calm one, realizing that anger was no solution to their problem.","A. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.
B. Paul had always lived by his father's mantra, ""It is important to keep learning new skills and not rely on one skill for your career."" He had spent over a decade honing his skills as a talented typographer. His designs were intricate and brought a unique touch to any piece of work that employed his typography. However, the growing influence of digital technology in his field made him realize that his specialized skill might not suffice.

The advent of automated design tools began threatening his once sought-after profession. Paul saw that these tools could do what took him days within minutes. It was a frightening revelation that with emerging technology, current skills, even his cherished typography, may become outdated in the future. 

Realizing this, he decided to adapt to the changing times. He started investing time into learning graphic design software and digital marketing skills. His willingness to learn ensured that his career stayed relevant and growing even in an evolving technological landscape.
C. Once upon a time, there was a flourishing tech company named Digitech, known for its innovative solutions and game-changing technology. However, over the years, their strategic management started losing its grip. The company's focus shifted from enhancing their technology and pleasing customers to mindless expansion and reckless spending. Gradually, the consequences began to appear in the company's financial health.

Digitech started to sink into an abyss of debts due to this erratic management. They kept on acquiring more and more loans to cover their extravagant expenses, creating a vicious cycle. It got to a point where the debts were so astronomical that they overshadowed the company's worth. The company was so debt-ridden that there seemed to be no silver lining in sight.

The staff grew anxious with the looming bankruptcy, and their efficiency dropped considerably. Looking at the horrid financial state and the demotivated employees, I thought it was safe to say that Digitech was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy. It was a painful sight seeing such a once vibrant company facing a downfall due to mismanagement and imprudence.
D. In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.",C,s 20197th and 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0.
19,The weather finally became pleasant following the stormy week.,"After a seemingly endless week of turbulent storms, the weather finally became pleasant. The gray, heavy clouds that had been hanging low in the sky like an oppressive blanket were replaced with a soft, clean blue expanse. For days, the town had been relentlessly pounded by rain, lightning tearing through the skies with a fury that sent shivers down one's spine. The wind had shrieked, howling like a banshee as it tore through the deserted streets, ripping leaves from the trees.

The townspeople had huddled inside their homes, watching nervously as the rain pelted against the windows, hoping the storm would soon pass. Children had been kept indoors, their laughter and joy missed in the quiet town. It was a week that many thought would never end, yet it did. Finally, the storm retreated, leaving behind a calmness that was almost surreal.

Sunlight poured down from the cloudless sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the town. The streets were filled with laughter and joy once more, as children dashed outside, thrilled to be free of the gloominess. The weather had finally become pleasant following the stormy week, leaving a sense of peace and relief that hung heavy in the air.","A. In the heart of a small, poverty-stricken village, the weather began to take a frightful turn. Ominous grey clouds darkened the sky, casting long, heavy shadows on the poorly built shacks below. Inhabitants of the village huddled inside their homes, bracing for the impending storm. Suddenly, an unrestrained gust of wind blew fiercely, bellowing through the narrow alleys.

The gust was strong and merciless, shaking the frail structures of the shacks as though they were mere toys. One by one, the shacks trembled and creaked under the wind's mighty wrath, their feeble resistance proving futile. Families could only watch helplessly as their homes crumbled around them, swept away by the vengeful gust.

And then, just as quickly as it had arrived, the violent wind ebbed, leaving behind a deafening silence and devastation. A soft breeze blew through the village next, as if nature was seeking to soothe the pain it had caused. The breeze gently kissed the cheeks of the shocked villagers, whispering an apology in their ears, but the fallen shacks were a cruel reminder of the havoc that had been wrought.
B. In the heart of the FBI headquarters, Agent Reynolds was handed a pile of files by his supervisor. ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly,"" warned the supervisor, sternly. Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection. 

Reluctantly, he nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. He found himself in the confines of his small office, glaring at the daunting pile. Each file represented a unique mystery in itself, with potential leads, suspects, and associated evidence. He dived into the first file, poring over every detail meticulously, hoping to uncover an overlooked clue. 

Hours turned into days as Reynolds immersed himself in the documentation, keeping himself fueled with a potent mix of determination and caffeine. As he dug deeper, patterns began to emerge, and a detailed profile of the suspects' modus operandi began to take shape. Eventually, after an intensive examination, a sense of achievement filled his tired eyes. He had not just a lead, but a plausible theory about the perpetrators of the heists. His supervisor was right; these files required a thorough look, and it was through his diligent attention to detail that he may have just cracked the case.
C. Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.
D. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.",A,"```

20,Having cried the entire night she greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine.,"Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.","A. The tension between Emma and Ethan was palpable. They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.
B. Brian sat in the board meeting, the atmosphere heavy with tension. He knew his colleagues were worried about the company’s future. After all, recent business strategies had failed, and their key competitors were pulling ahead in the market. The executives, one by one, presented their plans, but none seemed to impress the room.

Brian, however, kept quiet. He was a man of few words, preferring to observe, analyze, and then act. His blue eyes scanned the room, evaluating each colleague as they spoke. He listened to their plans, their ideas, the desperation seeping into their words, their body language speaking volumes of the stress they were under.

What they didn’t know was that Brian had been secretly working on a brilliant idea for the past few months. He had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time, a plan he was convinced would not only save the company but also catapult it ahead of their competitors.
C. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.
D. Peachwood Technologies, a mid-sized tech firm, had always boasted about its stable financial standing. However, this year had been turbulent and the company had taken a considerable financial hit due to unforeseen market conditions. As a result, the board was faced with a difficult decision when it came to the annual holiday bonus for its employees. 

The CEO, Martha, called for a company-wide virtual meeting to deliver the sobering news. In her heartfelt speech, she announced that the company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. She explained that the decision was a tough one and was taken only after exhausting all other cost-cutting alternatives. The announcement was met with disappointment, but Martha's honesty and transparency also earned her the respect of her employees. 

To soften the blow, Martha promised that the company would make up for the loss as soon as the financial situation improved. Despite the news, the employees took it in stride, understanding the difficulties faced by the company in these challenging times. The incident, although unfortunate, created a deeper bond among the employees and reinforced their commitment to the company.",C,"s, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the"

Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.
B. In the heart of a cozy, rustic kitchen sat a pot-bellied, old-fashioned stove. It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.
C. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.
D. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
22,"As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke.","The candle had been burning for hours, casting a warm glow across the room, but now its life was ending. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke. The smoke twirled and danced gracefully in the air, a subtle performance of nature, before slowly beginning to dissipate.

To John, who was quietly sitting across the room, this sequence of events felt oddly symbolic. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life - how something so beautiful and vibrant could just vanish in an instant, leaving behind a mere ghost of its existence. 

His mind traveled back to the year his mother had passed away. A once vivacious woman, her flame had too been dimmed by the cruel hands of cancer, leaving behind only memories - ephemeral wisp of smoke to grasp. 

He leaned back, closing his eyes, allowing himself to dive into the deeper depths of his thoughts, feeling the loss once again. He didn't know how long he sat there, lost in his thoughts, but when he opened his eyes again, the wisp of smoke had completely disappeared. The room was now submerged in darkness, the extinguished candle serving as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life.","A. Our friend group had a long-standing tradition of watching newly released movies every Friday. However, last Friday was different. I was swamped with work, Jason fell sick, and Lisa had an unexpected family gathering, leaving Sam alone for the weekly movie outing.

Despite the unusual circumstances, Sam's enthusiasm for movies was undeterred. She went to watch the latest thriller, a movie we had all been waiting for. The moment she returned, our group chat was abuzz with messages, everyone impatiently waiting for a detailed review of the film.

""Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it,"" said Lisa in the group chat, echoing everyone's anticipation.

We all agreed, quickly setting up a video call so that Sam could relay the story in detail. As she began narrating the plot, her excitement filled the digital room. It was a unique experience, hearing the story directly from Sam, and while we missed being there, we were glad that our Friday movie tradition lived on.
B. After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred. She had earned her freedom after years of laborious study and now was the time to enjoy it. The thought of experiencing new cultures and translating them onto her canvas excited Emily more than any high-paying job could ever do.
C. The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, their faces reflecting a mixture of exhaustion, anxiety, and a glimmer of triumph.
D. Once upon a time, there was a flourishing tech company named Digitech, known for its innovative solutions and game-changing technology. However, over the years, their strategic management started losing its grip. The company's focus shifted from enhancing their technology and pleasing customers to mindless expansion and reckless spending. Gradually, the consequences began to appear in the company's financial health.

Digitech started to sink into an abyss of debts due to this erratic management. They kept on acquiring more and more loans to cover their extravagant expenses, creating a vicious cycle. It got to a point where the debts were so astronomical that they overshadowed the company's worth. The company was so debt-ridden that there seemed to be no silver lining in sight.

The staff grew anxious with the looming bankruptcy, and their efficiency dropped considerably. Looking at the horrid financial state and the demotivated employees, I thought it was safe to say that Digitech was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy.

23,He danced off his sugar high then promptly fell asleep.,"At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.","A.

B. Growing up in a diverse city, Sam always believed that having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people. This belief originated from his childhood, where he always felt enriched by different cultural experiences. Being a food lover, he loved trying diverse cuisines. His group of foodie friends always had something interesting planned, from authentic Indian curries to Italian pasta workshops.

On the other hand, Sam was a sports enthusiast as well. He had a separate group of friends who shared his love for football. Every weekend they would gather in the local park, pick teams, and enjoy intense football matches. Their bond strengthened during the world cup when they used to gather at Sam's house, cheering for their favourite teams.

His intellectual thirst was satisfied by his book club friends. They met once every month to discuss a book they had all read. Their conversations, heated debates, and perspectives helped Sam broaden his outlook on life. Thus, by maintaining different social groups, Sam was able to find companionship and a sense of belonging while pursuing his varied interests.
C. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
D. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.",A,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
24,My pet dog is down for the count after playing the whole day with the frisbee.,"Max, my pet dog, is an energetic and playful soul. He has a great fondness for games, with his favorite being frisbee. Our routine was the same every day; as soon as I would get back from work, we would head straight to the park. This park, just a few blocks away, was Max's paradise.

Today was no different; we spent the whole day running around, chasing and tossing the frisbee under the warm sun. Max was the star of the park, darting around like a whirlwind with his bright red frisbee. He would leap into the air, trying to snatch the frisbee before it touched the ground, displaying his athleticism and enthusiasm.

As the sun began to set, we started our walk back home. The whole day of energetic play was evident on Max; he was panting hard but had an unmistakable gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Now, after a long day full of fun and games, my pet dog Max is down for the count, snoring softly in his corner, probably dreaming about another day full of frisbee fun.","A. I had been counting on Kim, my closest friend since childhood, to stand by my side during one of the most important days of my life. Her excitement matched mine when I first shared the news of my engagement, and naturally, I assumed she would be my maid of honor. But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry, my wedding marred by the startling realization that Kim had chosen not to support me on my special day.

C. My brother and I share a love for music, but our tastes can be worlds apart. His music tastes lean more towards pop and R&B, while I am more of a hard rock and alternative enthusiast. There is one particular singer that has captured my brother's admiration, someone whose vocals and techniques seem to utterly enchant him. Although this artist isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.

He would spend countless hours singing along to his songs and watching his concerts on YouTube. The singer's delicate control over his voice, how he subtly transitioned from soft and mellow to high and powerful notes, seemed to mesmerize my brother. He'd even taken to practicing the same techniques, humming the singer's songs in the shower or when he was alone in his room.

Yet for me, his music was a little too slow and didn't carry the energy and angst I preferred. I tried to appreciate it, for the sake of my brother, but it didn't quite resonate with me. But even though this singer wasn't my favorite, I respected his talent and more importantly, the joy he brought to my brother.
D. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today.

Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
B. We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.
C. After weeks of hunting for a place to stay, I finally found a modest apartment. The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.

26,"On his last birthday, Mike's friend gave him so many drinks that he passed out before midnight.","On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.","A. Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal. 

Laura is a dedicated artist, consumed by her work and often forgetting to take a break. Today was no different. She had started her marathon early in the morning. The sun had barely risen when she set up her easel and palette. Now, as the last rays of the setting sun seeped through the studio window, she lay exhausted on the floor.

Despite my insistence, she refused to get up for several minutes. The artistic satisfaction coursing through her veins seemed to outweigh the physical fatigue. I admired her dedication, as Laura proved yet again, that for her, art wasn't just a hobby but a way of life.
B. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.
C. For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.
D. Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.",A,"# A

27,"After going through an extensive workload, Ally got very sick and will be doing nothing but rest during this weekend.","Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.","A. Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike. To the world, we are two sides of the same coin, a study in contrast, but deep down, we are just two boys learning to navigate life in our unique ways.
B. Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.
C. On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.
D. Sally had always been the type to avoid strenuous physical activity; she had never stepped foot in a gym. Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears. She finally committed and announced with newfound determination that she would start going to the gym soon.",C,
28,"Having immersed herself in a day-long painting marathon, my friend is now completely drained and refused to get up for several minutes.","Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal. 

Laura is a dedicated artist, consumed by her work and often forgetting to take a break. Today was no different. She had started her marathon early in the morning. The sun had barely risen when she set up her easel and palette. Now, as the last rays of the setting sun seeped through the studio window, she lay exhausted on the floor.

Despite my insistence, she refused to get up for several minutes. The artistic satisfaction coursing through her veins seemed to outweigh the physical fatigue. I admired her dedication, as Laura proved yet again, that for her, art wasn't just a hobby but a way of life.","A. Seeing my old friend Mark after so long, I was ecstatic to hear that his child had reached a significant milestone. ""Wow, your kid just graduated middle school!"" I exclaimed, hardly believing how much time had passed since our own school days. 

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.
B. Harry Richardson, a savvy and seasoned politician, had spent his life mastering the art of political maneuvering. His charisma and charm were unmatched, but this time, he was facing a formidable opponent in the upcoming election, John Duncan. Though seemingly plain, Duncan's honesty and transparent policies were rapidly gaining popular appeal. It seemed as though the competition was going to be tougher than Harry had initially anticipated. 

Behind closed doors, Harry had crafted a secret plan, a wild card that he was certain would tip the scales in his favor. Weeks before the election, he received an anonymous tip about a scandal involving Duncan. He had spent painstaking hours verifying the information, ensuring not to leave any room for errors. At the last possible moment, just days before the election, he made his move.

In a televised press conference, Harry revealed the scandalous secret about Duncan involving financial fraud. The shocking revelation sent waves through the entire nation, causing a significant shift in public opinion. The scales indeed tipped and Harry was once again, thanks to his secret plan, the people's choice for leadership.
C. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.
D. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.",C,"D.

29,Monica cooked so much food last weekend in the restaurant that she had to take a leave to rest on Monday.,"Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.","A. Philip was notorious for his clever excuses and sly tricks to dodge chores. His parents, especially his mother, were growing weary of this routine. The time had come when Philip had to understand the importance of work, no matter how trivial it seemed. One day, Philip adopted his tried and tested method of avoiding chores again. He started pretending to be immensely busy with his schoolwork. He was hoping this tactic would continue to serve him as it always had.

But his mother, observing him closely, started to sense that something was not right. After a little investigation, she found out he had no pending work from school. Seeing his lack of sincerity, his mother decided to teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget. She commanded Philip to take over the chores not just for that day, but for the entire week, forcing him to step into the reality of responsibility.
B. At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.
C. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.
D. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.",B,"2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2039, 2040, 2041, 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049, 2050, 2051, 2052, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2062, 2063, 2064"
30,After working two years for the company she was burned out.,"Elizabeth had been a dedicated employee of Wilmont & Co. for two long years. She had joined the company as a fresh-faced graduate, ready to conquer the corporate world with her innovative ideas and infectious enthusiasm. Initially, she loved the challenges her job as a financial analyst presented, enjoyed the camarity with her colleagues, and thrived on the intensity of her work.

However, as time passed, the novelty wore off and the pressures started to mount. Projects began to pile up, deadlines became tighter, and the lines between her personal and professional lives blurred. Elizabeth found herself pouring over financial reports at midnight, attending virtual meetings during her breakfast time, and responding to business emails on weekends. She was always on call, always available, always working.

After enduring this relentless grind for two years, Elizabeth felt a profound exhaustion that no amount of sleep could mend. The once passionate and driven professional, was now just a burned-out shell of her former self. She looked at the company emblem on her screen one day, and realized that she was worn out to the core, understanding that it wasn't just her job she was tired of but her entire life within the company.","A. Peachwood Technologies, a mid-sized tech firm, had always boasted about its stable financial standing. However, this year had been turbulent and the company had taken a considerable financial hit due to unforeseen market conditions. As a result, the board was faced with a difficult decision when it came to the annual holiday bonus for its employees. 

The CEO, Martha, called for a company-wide virtual meeting to deliver the sobering news. In her heartfelt speech, she announced that the company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. She explained that the decision was a tough one and was taken only after exhausting all other cost-cutting alternatives. The announcement was met with disappointment, but Martha's honesty and transparency also earned her the respect of her employees. 

To soften the blow, Martha promised that the company would make up for the loss as soon as the financial situation improved. Despite the news, the employees took it in stride, understanding the difficulties faced by the company in these challenging times. The incident, although unfortunate, created a deeper bond among the employees and reinforced their commitment to the company.
B. Max, my pet dog, is an energetic and playful soul. He has a great fondness for games, with his favorite being frisbee. Our routine was the same every day; as soon as I would get back from work, we would head straight to the park. This park, just a few blocks away, was Max's paradise.

Today was no different; we spent the whole day running around, chasing and tossing the frisbee under the warm sun. Max was the star of the park, darting around like a whirlwind with his bright red frisbee. He would leap into the air, trying to snatch the frisbee before it touched the ground, displaying his athleticism and enthusiasm.

As the sun began to set, we started our walk back home. The whole day of energetic play was evident on Max; he was panting hard but had an unmistakable gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Now, after a long day full of fun and games, my pet dog Max is down for the count, snoring softly in his corner, probably dreaming about another day full of frisbee fun.
C. Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.
D. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.",B,"D.

The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage. 

Despite the diversity of their subjects, a sense of camaraderie marked each group. United by shared interests, they were all part of the dynamic world of technology, bridging gaps and paving the way for a shared future.
B. Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal.

C. Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.
D. Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.",B,"#include <iostream>

32,"You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one.","Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.","A. I had a particular craving for Italian food that evening. The rich taste of pasta tossed in the savory tomato sauce and the enticing aroma of the herbs was something I wanted to treat myself with. I checked my wallet and felt my heart sink. 

It was nearly empty, devoid of the cash I needed for such an expensive indulgence. The disappointment was overwhelming, but I tried to console myself with the thought that at least I had something to eat at home. As I opened the fridge, I saw it. A small container with left-over rice from last night's dinner was sitting there, patiently waiting for me.

I sighed, the contrast between my wishful thinking and reality was indeed harsh. With a heavy heart, I heated up the rice and sat down to eat. I kept dreaming about Italian food, but I had to make do with what I had. I made a promise to myself, one day I would be able to afford that dinner without worrying about my wallet.
B. Ever since we were kids, Jack and I had a friendship that others envied. We grew up next door, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures in our small, quiet town. The bond was genuine, and I believed we'd always be there for each other. However, as we grew older and life became more complex, I noticed a change in Jack's behavior.

Our conversations started becoming one-sided with him ignoring my words and even belittling my opinions. It stung more than I was willing to admit. That was not the Jack I knew and cherished. The Jack I knew was empathetic, understanding, and most importantly, respectful. Thus, I couldn't help but hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In response, I distanced myself, feeling betrayed and upset. I missed our old friendship, but I couldn't overlook his disrespectful behavior. With time, I managed to accept the change, holding onto the memories of our past and hoping that one day, the Jack I once knew would return.
C. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics, seeing it merely as a jumble of numbers and variables that are not relatable to everyday life. Often, they regard math as a complicated series of equations and formulas to memorize. However, this perspective does not do justice to the richness and depth of this discipline. To me, mathematics is the most meaningful subject.

From an early age, I've always been fascinated by the harmony and precision found in mathematical concepts. The pure logic and absolute certainty captured in mathematical proofs provide a sense of satisfaction and comfort that no other subject can offer. As I manipulate figures and calculate equations, I feel a connection with the universe's fundamental laws and principles.

Every formula and theorem in mathematics reveals something profound about our world. It expresses abstract ideas like infinity and simplicity with an elegant language of numbers and symbols. Despite its complexity, the beauty of mathematics lies in its simplicity, consistency, and its ability to describe the world with absolute precision.

The process of solving a mathematical problem is like an exciting journey of discovery. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving a complex equation is unparalleled. This is the beauty I find in mathematics, making it, for me, the most meaningful subject.",C,"```

33,"He left his partner to find true love, only to realize that he already had it before.","John had spent his life in a seemingly perfect relationship with his partner, Emily. They shared a comfort that most couples envied; but with time, a subtle discontent started brewing within him. The glamour of fiery passion in movies and novels stirred a yearning in his heart for a love that was more dramatic, more intoxicating. He decided to embark on a quest to find this supposed ""true love.""

Against Emily's pleas and tears, he left his familiar life behind, diving headfirst into a whirlpool of unknown emotions. John dated various women, tried to find that spark he saw in romantic films, but every relationship ended the same way. None of them ignited the flame he was longing for, instead, they were all marred with superficiality, misunderstandings, and disagreements.

In his solitude, he began reflecting on his past relationship with Emily. Suddenly, he was overwhelmed by the memories of their shared laughter, mutual respect, deep conversations, and undeniable comfort. It dawned upon him, the regret hitting him like a punch to the gut, that he had already found his true love in Emily, and he let it slip away, chasing an illusion of love curated by fiction.","A. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.
B. As Jack prepared to step out of the house, his mother called after him, ""Make sure you take an umbrella."" Jack paused, looking over his shoulder at her with an amused smirk. He pointed out the window, saying, ""But mom, look outside. It's bright and sunny. There's not a cloud in sight.""

His mother replied, remaining unfazed, her stance firm and unchanging. ""I know it's sunny now, my darling. But weather is as unpredictable as life itself,"" she said with a knowing look. ""It may be bright and clear now, but it could rain cats and dogs later.""

With a nod of understanding, Jack took the proffered umbrella. His mother’s favorite saying, ""Better safe than sorry,"" echoed in his mind. Acknowledging her wisdom, he flashed her a grateful smile and walked out, the sun-kissed day not seeming as deceiving as it was earlier.
C. Many people often cringe when they hear about the color combination of orange and green. They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.
D. Harry Richardson, a savvy and seasoned politician, had spent his life mastering the art of political maneuvering. His charisma and charm were unmatched, but this time, he was facing a formidable opponent in the upcoming election, John Duncan. Though seemingly plain, Duncan's honesty and transparent policies were rapidly gaining popular appeal. It seemed as though the competition was going to be tougher than Harry had initially anticipated. 

Behind closed doors, Harry had crafted a secret plan, a wild card that he was certain would tip the scales in his favor. Weeks before the election, he received an anonymous tip about a scandal involving Duncan. He had spent painstaking hours verifying the information, ensuring not to leave any room for errors. At the last possible moment, just days before the election, he made his move.

In a televised press conference, Harry revealed the scandalous secret about Duncan involving financial fraud. The shocking revelation sent waves through the entire nation, causing a significant shift in public opinion. The scales indeed tipped and Harry was once again, thanks to his secret plan, the people's choice for leadership.",B,#1000111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
34,Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.,"For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.","A. For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.
B. The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, their faces reflecting a mixture of exhaustion, anxiety, and a glimmer of triumph.
C. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.
D. Living with a roommate can be challenging, especially when it comes to housekeeping responsibilities. Jeremy found this out the hard way when he moved in with Mark. Just because his roommate, Mark, never cleaned up after himself, didn't mean Jeremy should too. Jeremy was raised with strong values of cleanliness and organisation.

At first, he tried to cope with the mess, hoping Mark would eventually pick up his clothes, wash his dishes, and take out the garbage. But as time went by, Jeremy realized that this change was unlikely to happen. Mark's careless attitude towards cleanliness was beginning to irk him. He decided not to let his roommate's bad habits influence him, he didn't want to lower his standards.

One day, he took it upon himself to discuss the situation with Mark, expressing his feelings about the ongoing mess. After a lengthy discussion, Mark agreed to make more of an effort, promising that their shared space would be more livable, which showed Jeremy that standing up for cleanliness was indeed the right decision.",C,
35,I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.,"I've been cooking for the majority of my life, and over the years, I've accumulated an impressive array of cooking utensils. Some of them are shiny and new, flaunting an array of fancy features. Lately, there's been a new utensil in the market that's been getting quite a buzz; it's sleek, multifunctional, and apparently worth the hefty price tag. Even so, I'm not tempted.

To me, nothing can replace my old pan. It's a simple, nondescript thing, with a worn-out handle and the faint traces of countless meals. It's this pan that has been my trusty companion in preparing countless family meals and festive feasts. The new utensil may have the latest features, but it does not have the countless memories attached to it. 

Yes, my pan may be old, it may not be the shiniest, or have the latest features, but it's dependable. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.","A. Mary was known in her quaint town not just for her cheerful demeanor, but also for her extensive rose garden. She was incredibly proud of it and often boasted that her rose garden was the best in the entire city. She would lovingly prune the roses every day, her hand skimming over the vibrant hues with a sense of satisfaction and adoration. 

However, anyone who visited Mary's place would be far from impressed. To the outsider's eye, Mary's garden was nothing but ordinary. The roses were indeed beautiful, but they were the common variety that could be found anywhere in the city. 

Her rose bushes were not meticulously manicured, and the arrangement of her plants lacked imagination. There were no benches or fountains, nor were there any artistic sculptures that were often seen in other local gardens. The paths were not lined with charming pebbles, and there was no pergola under which one could rest.

In reality, Mary's garden, despite her pride and joy, was just like any other in the city. But in her eyes, the love and time she invested made it the most extraordinary garden of all.
B. In the heart of the bustling city of Washington D.C, a young and ambitious senator, John, received an urgent call. His assistant, Martha, breathlessly told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate."" John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward. When he finally arrived at the Senate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had heeded Martha's advice and left immediately.

D. John and his wife, Liza, had long awaited the arrival of a little one. Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

Liza would often find him sitting quietly in the room, staring at the beautifully painted walls with a distant look in his eyes. But no matter what the adoption agency's decision turned out to be, John was determined that the room would not go in vain, it would be a sanctuary of hope, a testament to their love and longing for a child.",C,"```

36,Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up.,"As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.","A. James leaned back in his chair, gently gesturing toward Mike, who sat across the room, nursing a cup of coffee. ""Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details,"" he suggested, his eyes flickering with empathy towards his friend. 

Everyone's attention turned to Mike, who was staring blankly into his cup. He looked up, surprised at first but then realizing he had a captive audience. A mild hush fell over the room, the air filled with anticipation and curiosity. 

Drawing a long breath, he began recounting the events of that fateful day. ""I still remember, it was a crisp autumn morning,"" he began, setting the mood, his words echoing in the silent room. His voice quivered slightly as he shared the horrifying experience he had with a home intruder the previous week. 

He described the paralyzing fear, the life-threatening confrontation and the relief when the police finally arrived. The room remained silent as the details unfolded, everyone listening attentively, taking in the raw and honest account of his ordeal. His story filled the room with a palpable tension, the listeners sympathetically sharing his fear, his struggle, and ultimately, his relief.
B. She was the talk of the town, spinning outrageous stories about everyone, giving them enough reasons to loathe her presence. She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.
C. The summer of 2016 was unforgettable, as it was filled with a fantastic vacation my family and I had been planning for months. We had decided to embark on a month-long exploration trip across Europe, seeing the sights and soaking in the culture of different countries. The first week was spent roaming the beautiful, love-filled streets of Paris, where we ascended the Eiffel Tower and indulged in scrumptious, traditional French cuisine. 

Our second destination was the historically rich city of Rome, Italy, where we marveled at the grandeur of the Colosseum and indulged in some of the best pizzas and pastas. After Italy, we moved on to Spain, where we enjoyed the lively Flamenco dances and the unique architecture in Barcelona. The magic of these experiences was amplified by the bond my family and I shared, as we created countless memories and grew closer with every passing day. 

As each day passed, our holiday got better, leaving us yearning for more adventures and experiences. Yet, the final week came all too soon, and we found ourselves back home, unpacking our suitcases and hanging up the photos we took. We sighed, missing the vibrancy and excitement that our vacation had brought. It was indeed a fantastic vacation, but as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.
D. Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.",D,#1234566778888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
37,"Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden.","George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.","A. Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between hills, a young boy named Max lived with his parents. He was a clever lad, always curious about the world around him. One day, his best friend, Danny, came to him with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. He suggested they steal apples from Mr. Johnson's orchard, as many other kids had done it before.

Max felt a rush of excitement at the idea, but at the same time, he knew it was wrong. He thought back to the lessons his parents had always taught him about right and wrong. He remembered them telling him, ""It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it."" 

With his parents' words echoing in his mind, Max looked at Danny and shook his head. He explained to Danny that stealing was wrong, no matter how many others were doing it. From that day on, Max always stood up for what was right, teaching his friends along the way about the importance of morality over popularity.
B. For decades, Thomas had been an artful dodger of tax payments. Every year, he would sit at his large mahogany desk and meticulously find every possible loophole that he could exploit to avoid contributing to the government coffers. He had a plethora of offshore bank accounts, businesses registered under different aliases, and he'd even explored the uncharted territory of cryptocurrency. He saw himself as a fiscal genius, a virtuoso of financial evasion. He was proud of his growing wealth and truly believed that he was outwitting the system.

Everything seemed perfect in his paradise of deceit until one cold January morning when a knock on his door echoed through his mansion. The men who stood on his doorstep were not interested in the expensive artwork on the walls or the luxury cars in the driveway. Their focus was on the man who had managed to avoid paying taxes for more than twenty years. The Internal Revenue Service, along with the FBI, had finally caught on to his illicit activities. Now, after years of enjoying his ill-gotten wealth, Thomas was staring at the possibility of nearly 10 years behind the cold, bleak bars of a federal prison.
C. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.
D. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.",D,"#define the function `f` in the `main` function and call it with the argument `5` as an argument.

38,"Make sure you take an umbrella – I know it's sunny now, but better safe than sorry.","As Jack prepared to step out of the house, his mother called after him, ""Make sure you take an umbrella."" Jack paused, looking over his shoulder at her with an amused smirk. He pointed out the window, saying, ""But mom, look outside. It's bright and sunny. There's not a cloud in sight.""

His mother replied, remaining unfazed, her stance firm and unchanging. ""I know it's sunny now, my darling. But weather is as unpredictable as life itself,"" she said with a knowing look. ""It may be bright and clear now, but it could rain cats and dogs later.""

With a nod of understanding, Jack took the proffered umbrella. His mother’s favorite saying, ""Better safe than sorry,"" echoed in his mind. Acknowledging her wisdom, he flashed her a grateful smile and walked out, the sun-kissed day not seeming as deceiving as it was earlier.","A. Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.
B. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter. This wasn't just any letter, it was a letter of apology that took me countless drafts and revisions to get just right. I'd been wrestling with my feelings for so long, knowing I had wronged a dear friend and not knowing how to mend the damage.

Night after night, I poured my thoughts and remorse onto paper, only to crumple it up and throw it away. The words never seemed to adequately express my regret. The sense of shame and guilt gnawed at my conscience every day. I was on edge, wondering if the friendship I had ruined would ever be salvaged.

Finally, after two grueling weeks, I had a version I was somewhat satisfied with. I remember walking to the post office with a trembling hand, slipping the envelope into the mailbox, feeling a strange sense of relief mixed with apprehension. I knew I had done my part in seeking forgiveness, and all that was left was to hope my friend would understand.
C. Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike. To the world, we are two sides of the same coin, a study in contrast, but deep down, we are just two boys learning to navigate life in our unique ways.
D. For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.",D,
39,"To avoid burning your hands, use oven mitts when removing the cake, as it will be hot unlike how it is now.","The sweet aroma of vanilla wafted through the house, tantalizing everyone with its intoxicating fragrance. Sam was baking his famous vanilla pound cake for a Sunday family gathering. He had spent the entire morning stirring batter, adding ingredients, and pouring love into his baking. The time came for the much-anticipated cake to come out of the oven. 

""Remember kids, to avoid burning your hands, use oven mitts when removing the cake,"" he explained, ""as it will be hot unlike how it is now."" The children, enthralled by the baking process, paid heed to his words and scampered away to find the colorful oven mitts. With mitts in hand, they returned to Sam, eyes wide with excitement. 

Sam gently pulled the oven door open, the heat instantly warming the room. They carefully removed the golden brown cake, the heat seeping through the mitts as they held the tray. The sight of the perfectly baked cake made everyone's mouth water and they couldn't wait to taste it, knowing it would be as delicious as the previous ones.","A. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.
B. Rosalind had always been a strong-willed woman, driven by her principles. She held an unwavering belief in owning her mistakes and taking responsibility. However, when she wronged her best friend, Abigail, she found herself straying from her own rules. The incident happened during their annual Christmas party. In a fit of jealousy and misunderstanding, Rosalind had wrongly accused Abigail of trying to steal her boyfriend.

It took her a week to realize that her accusation had been mistaken; her boyfriend had been the one who initiated the flirtation. As she saw her friendship with Abigail crumble and fall apart, guilt and regret started to eat her alive. However, she let her pride get in the way, which stopped her from immediately apologizing and confessing to Abigail. Her ego created a barrier, and two painful years passed, with their friendship left in tatters.

Finally, she gathered the courage to swallow her pride and reach out to her friend. Rosalind wrote a heartfelt apology to Abigail, confessing to her mistake and expressing her deep regret. She wasn't sure if Abigail would forgive her, but she knew she had to take the first step to mend their broken friendship.
C. Sally was usually a shy and introverted person. She preferred solitude to gatherings and found people tiresome. However, there was one person that Sally enjoyed being around. Sharon was her best friend, her confidant, the only person that could bring out the true Sally.

Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around. There was a certain kind of energy that Sharon carried around her; infectious, warm, and welcoming. It was something that she seemed to radiate, and it was impossible not to be drawn towards it. 

Sharon's presence would light up Sally's world, push away the shyness and anxiety. It would replace them with joy, laughter, and a level of comfort that Sally found with no one else. Their bond was a special one, a friendship that Sally would forever cherish and look forward to. It was a friendship that turned Sally's world a little less intimidating, a little less lonely, and a lot more fun.
D. Once upon a time, Olive was a commonly discussed name at the family's dinner table. He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

After that, no one in the family spoke about Olive anymore. Over time, he became the ""black sheep,"" the name that was avoided in conversations, the son who had stained their good name. Despite the love they once had for him, Olive's actions had ultimately led to his exclusion from the family.",A,"s and the 2018th of February 2018, at the 20th of March 2018, at the 20th of April 2018, at the 20th of May 2018, at the 20th of June 2018, at the 20th of July 2018, at the 20th of August 2018, at the 20th of September 2018, at the 20th of October 2018, at the 20th of November 2018, and at the 20th of December 2018."

B. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
C. Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.
D. Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.",A,D.
41,"Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you as if you negotiate too much they might take the offer back.","Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, lived a young artist named Alex. He was full of aspirations, with an insatiable desire for success in his artistic endeavors. One day, he got an offer from a renowned gallery to showcase his works. His old and wise mentor, Robert, was ecstatic to hear this news. 

Seeing the glittering greed in Alex's eyes, Robert cautioned, ""Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you."" He emphasized the gravity of his statement by adding, ""If you negotiate too much they might take the offer back."" Alex, blinded by his greed, dismissed Robert's wise advice as the fear of an old man.

However, his relentless negotiation with the gallery didn't go well. The gallery management, unimpressed with his unabashed greed, withdrew their offer. Alex, left with regret and an invaluable lesson, realized the wisdom in Robert's words: modesty sometimes had its rewards.","A. As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.
B. Everyone in the small, tight-knit community thought that he would lose. Daniel had always been a dreamer, but his aspiration to win the annual Tri-County Marathon seemed an impossible task. After all, he had never attempted any such thing before. Furthermore, the formidable Harry Wilson, with his track record of consecutive wins, was participating this year too.

Nobody, except Daniel, thought that he stood a chance. But Daniel was determined to prove them wrong. He spent hours every day training, pushing his body to its absolute limits. He endured every muscle cramp, every stitch in his side, and every moment of exhaustion, with a spirit that could only be described as herculean.

Finally, the marathon day arrived. Everyone watched in astonishment as Daniel not only finished, but also surpassed the undefeatable Harry Wilson. Despite the disbelief of the entire town, he had managed to stage an extraordinary comeback through his herculean effort and won the race, proving to everyone that even the impossible can be made possible with unyielding determination.
C. Alena was a quiet and introverted girl in her senior year of high school. She was consistently seen in the library or the laboratory, completely immersed in her books. She was never a part of the overly flamboyant crowd, the ones who enjoyed boasting about their intelligence, their latest scores, and achievements. In contrast to them, Alena had a calm, poised demeanor.

People often underestimated her due to her unassuming personality. Even her teachers were unaware of the prodigy that hid beneath her humble exterior. Her friends, however, knew about her dedication, about the late-night study sessions and countless revisions she put into her preparation for the board exams.

The result day arrived, and everyone held their breath in anticipation. The school's top rank was taken by the usual, boastful scholar. However, when Alena's name was announced for the second position, the hall echoed with surprise and admiration. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.

Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
B. In the bustling corporate office of Dynamic Solutions, Alex was overwhelmed. As a new recruit, he had been taking on as much work as possible to make a good impression. However, his supervisor, Mike, sensed his apprehension and took him aside for a chat. ""Alex,"" Mike said, ""there's no need to take on so much work this quarter.""

Mike's words seemed counterintuitive to Alex, given his ambitious nature. ""Our company policy is a bit different,"" Mike explained, ""the performance this quarter won't significantly impact appraisals. So, don't stretch yourself too thin in your desire to impress.""

Instead, Mike advised Alex to strategically invest more time and effort in the next two quarters. Those were the periods when the management would be actively prioritizing individual contributions. Feeling relieved, Alex thanked his supervisor, promising to heed his advice and manage his workload more strategically in the future.
C. Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.

43,Keep a jug full of water near the table in case you get thirsty at night.,"Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.","A. James leaned back in his chair, gently gesturing toward Mike, who sat across the room, nursing a cup of coffee. ""Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details,"" he suggested, his eyes flickering with empathy towards his friend. 

Everyone's attention turned to Mike, who was staring blankly into his cup. He looked up, surprised at first but then realizing he had a captive audience. A mild hush fell over the room, the air filled with anticipation and curiosity. 

Drawing a long breath, he began recounting the events of that fateful day. ""I still remember, it was a crisp autumn morning,"" he began, setting the mood, his words echoing in the silent room. His voice quivered slightly as he shared the horrifying experience he had with a home intruder the previous week. 

He described the paralyzing fear, the life-threatening confrontation and the relief when the police finally arrived. The room remained silent as the details unfolded, everyone listening attentively, taking in the raw and honest account of his ordeal. His story filled the room with a palpable tension, the listeners sympathetically sharing his fear, his struggle, and ultimately, his relief.
B. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
C. John and Sarah had been married for five years. The initial honeymoon phase faded away, and they started noticing each other's flaws and quirks. Small issues like not putting the toilet seat down or forgetting to pick up groceries on the way home, which used to go unnoticed, were now turning into a cause of frequent squabbles.

One day, their mutual friend Mike noticed the tension between them. He advised them to address and resolve these small issues before they grow into bigger problems. Mike reminded them of the love they shared and suggested focusing on open communication to understand each other's perspective.

Taking Mike's advice to heart, John and Sarah started resolving each small issue immediately instead of letting it fester. They openly discussed their expectations, frustrations, and found ways to compromise. Over time, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their relationship. This made them realize that resolving small issues immediately indeed prevented bigger troubles down the road.
D. As Jack prepared to step out of the house, his mother called after him, ""Make sure you take an umbrella."" Jack paused, looking over his shoulder at her with an amused smirk. He pointed out the window, saying, ""But mom, look outside. It's bright and sunny. There's not a cloud in sight.""

His mother replied, remaining unfazed, her stance firm and unchanging. ""I know it's sunny now, my darling. But weather is as unpredictable as life itself,"" she said with a knowing look. ""It may be bright and clear now, but it could rain cats and dogs later.""

With a nod of understanding, Jack took the proffered umbrella. His mother’s favorite saying, ""Better safe than sorry,"" echoed in his mind. Acknowledging her wisdom, he flashed her a grateful smile and walked out, the sun-kissed day not seeming as deceiving as it was earlier.",D,"# 100% Free Online Dating in Mumbai

They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.","A. After years of oscillating on various projects and careers, I had finally committed myself to a cause I believed in. It was not merely a project, it was a dream; an aspiration that I had carried in my heart for what felt like an eternity. This time, I decided I would see the project through, no matter what it took. 

I could clearly envisage the path ahead of me, peppered with challenges and obstacles. Yet, the inherent value of the work outweighed any adversity I might encounter. The project was complex, sure, but it was deeply exciting and promised to be profoundly rewarding.

I was willing to put in late hours, to work through weekends if necessary. In fact, I was prepared to go beyond my physical and mental boundaries, to stretch my limits. There would be no room for procrastination or distractions in my life.

The journey was sure to be strenuous, maybe even overwhelming at times, but I was steadfast in my determination. The project would be my top priority, and I was ready to do anything to get the work done. I was resolved to translate my dream into reality, to transform my vision into a tangible, successful outcome.
B. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.
C. After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.
D. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.",A,"```

Emma was a shy girl, not exactly the type the school's heartthrobs queued up to ask out for dances. However, she nurtured a secret hope that one day, her quiet presence would catch someone's eye. So, she often saved up her pocket money, dreaming of buying that gorgeous red dress on display in the vintage boutique downtown. She wanted to buy a dress in case someone asked her to the dance.

One day, she shared this secret with me, her best friend. Seeing the yearning in her eyes, my heart ached for her. But I also knew that it was not wise to foster false hope. So, I told her gently, ""Emma, I understand your wish. But, don't count your chickens before they hatch. You should focus on finding happiness in the present rather than waiting for a future event that may or may not occur.""
B. As October turned into November, I could feel an excitement and slight nervousness bubbling up within me. This year was going to be different because for the first time, I was determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch. Always intimidated by the thought of preparing such a large and traditional meal, I had always opted to order from the local deli or have the family gathering at a restaurant. But not this time, I wanted to bring a personal touch to our family gathering.

My plan was to start with the turkey, then the stuffing, followed by the cranberry sauce, and finish off with an assortment of delightful sides and desserts. Even though it was a mammoth task, I was ready for the challenge. I spent days researching recipes, procuring the freshest ingredients, and practicing my carving skills.

The day arrived, and I was filled with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. It was indeed a whirlwind of activity with the kitchen filled with a delicious aroma, family laughter echoing in the background, and the soulful melody of Thanksgiving songs. At the end of the day, despite the difficulties, the joy I saw on my family's faces while devouring the meal made it all worthwhile. I knew then that it was the beginning of a beautiful tradition, a gesture of love that would be remembered and relished for years to come.
C. David had longed all day for the comforting familiarity of his favorite restaurant, The Cherry Orchard. Work had been particularly challenging, littered with meetings and unforeseen crises, pushing him to the brink of his sanity. The first chance he got, he quickly escaped to his gastronomic haven.

The minute he walked in, he was greeted by the warm lights and the homely smell of freshly cooked meals. As always, he ordered the chef's special - a divine chicken casserole with rustic bread on the side. From the moment the dish was placed in front of him, he could see the steam rising, the sauce gently bubbling, and the bread, golden brown, releasing an inviting aroma.

He started eating with the kind of fervor only seen in a man who has had to survive an exhaustive day without a bite. Each spoonful was savored, every bite was cherished as the delectable flavor danced on his tongue, rejuvenating his exhausted soul. He was so lost in the moment, so enthralled by the food, that time seemed to blur and hasten simultaneously. 

But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal. Looking down at the empty plate, he could only muster a satisfied sigh, his hunger and weariness both vanquished by the hearty dish.
D. In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

Veins popped out from his neck as his anger intensified, and his voice echoed like thunder through the silent streets. The crowd around them flinched at his every word, each one sharper and harsher than the last. His rage had controlled him, made him a roaring lion amongst the frightened lambs. But, after spewing out his frustrations, Gerald's storm slowly began to calm. 

He felt a heaviness lift from his chest as he expelled his rage, his mind clearing like the sky after a tempest. After letting off his rage, he sat down like a lamb, his once roaring demeanor replaced with a calm one, realizing that anger was no solution to their problem.",B,#B
46,"After the team’s defeat last season, they fired their manager and have decided to give it their all to win the title this season.","After a harsh and unforgiving defeat in the last season, the Panthers were left heartbroken. Team morale hit an all-time low, and the players knew something needed to change. On one fateful day, the team collectively agreed to fire their manager, believing that this was the first step to change their fate. The decision was indeed a difficult one, but they decided to prioritize the survival of the team.

In the wake of the termination, the Panthers began the grueling task of restructuring their strategies. They trained relentlessly, committing every hour, every minute, and every second they could spare. They worked on their weaknesses, turning them into strengths; they refined their strengths, making them unparalleled. Each team member started to have a spark in their eyes again, a spark that reflected their unyielding determination.

As the new season approached, a newfound sense of hope and motivation filled the locker room. The Panthers were ready to give it their all, not just to compete, but to seize the title this season and prove to everyone that they were champions, through and through.","A. The economic depression that began to grip the nation was not a sudden event. In fact, it was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies that had been implemented over a period of years. The government, in a bid to stimulate economic growth, had begun to invest heavily in risky ventures.

Early on, the nation had seen a surge in economic activity. It seemed for a while that the risky policies were actually paying off. Yet, a keen observer would have noticed the unsustainable trajectory of this growth. Many companies, fueled by reckless investments, were expanding at a rate far beyond their means.

However, the bubble burst when these companies began defaulting on their loans. Banks, suddenly faced with massive losses, began to tighten their loan policies. As credit began to dry up, businesses started to fold, leading to layoffs and the economic depression. Therefore, it can be seen that this depression was not a random event, but a consequence of several risky fiscal policies.
B. After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred. She had earned her freedom after years of laborious study and now was the time to enjoy it. The thought of experiencing new cultures and translating them onto her canvas excited Emily more than any high-paying job could ever do.
C. Jacob sat down next to me at our favorite local café, an anxious look stretched across his face. He was contemplating a big decision - an opportunity to move across the country for a new job. I looked at him, sipping my coffee, and said, ""You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.""

He looked puzzled, not fully understanding what I meant. I explained further, ""Think about it, Jacob. Here, you know the market, you have your network, and the comfort of your home. This familiarity provides you with more options and opportunities."" 

Suddenly, his anxious look eased a bit. He knew the decision wouldn't be easy, but the wisdom behind the advice resonated with him. Jacob decided to dedicate himself to the opportunities at hand, vowing to work harder and seize every chance before making the big move. He understood then that once he moved, everything would change, and he needed to prepare for that inevitability.

47,The poker player liked the hand he was dealt and kept calling until he had staked all his money.,"Derek, the seasoned poker player, stared intently at the hand he was dealt. His cool, calm, collected exterior masked the thrill rushing through his veins. After hours of mediocre hands, this was the one he'd been waiting for - a straight flush in spades. The corners of his lips tilted upwards in a barely visible smile. 

Across the table, his opponents, a tough group of poker regulars, continued their tactical bluffing, unaware of Derek's excitement. He matched their bets without hesitation, his confident eyes never wavering. Round after round, he kept calling, his pile of chips dwindling steadily. 

Finally, the last round arrived and with a deep breath, Derek pushed his remaining chips into the center. He had staked all his money, leaving his fate at the mercy of the cards. The room held its breath, waiting for the reveal, intrigued to see whether Derek's confidence was well-founded or misplaced.","A. Gary had always been passionate about nurturing things, which gradually led to a love for gardening. As a professional baseball player, he had little time to indulge in this passion of his during the active seasons. It was during the off season, he decided to invest both his time and money into creating a small garden for himself.

Gary purchased various seeds, gardening tools and started laboring in his backyard, tirelessly. Over time, his backyard began to reflect his hard work. A neat little garden with budding greens started taking shape, bringing him immense joy.

But as the winter months began to roll in, he noticed that his garden was not faring as well as he had imagined. The lack of ample sunlight and warmth was affecting the growth of his plants. It was at that point that Gary felt a pang of regret.

He wished he had started planning and working on his garden during the spring and summer seasons when the plants would have enjoyed optimal conditions for growth. The plants would have been more visible, lush, and healthy. Despite the regret, Gary was not disheartened. He was now better prepared for the next season and eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to enhance his garden.
B. John and I had always been obsessed with mysteries and true crime stories. When we heard about the recent robbery in our quiet neighborhood, we knew we needed to investigate. ""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" I suggested to John. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear from him directly.""

John agreed and we both took the short walk to Mr. Thompson's house, a semi-detached property that had seen better days. Knocking on the door, we were greeted by a man in his sixties, seemingly calm despite his ordeal. He invited us in, offering us a weak smile as he served us cups of lukewarm tea.

We sat in his surprisingly orderly living room, full of anticipation. He began sharing his experience, his voice trembling as he remembered the incident. Each detail was more thrilling than the next - from how he discovered his missing possessions, to his first glimpse of the security footage revealing the burglar's masked face. Though we felt empathy for Mr. Thompson's loss, we couldn't hide our excitement at living a real life mystery. It was indeed much more thrilling hearing it from the victim himself.
C. Over the past few weeks, the city was riveted by the high-profile case of a business mogul accused of fraud. It wasn't just another legal case, this was something that had held everyone's interest, given the stature of the individual involved. Word had been floating around that the mogul's defense was falling apart. But today, whispers filled the courtroom with a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown. It wasn't just a rumor, the buzz was everywhere - the coffee shops, the corridors of the courthouse, and even on live television reports. The news was intriguing - an unexpected turn in a case that seemed almost closed.

A hush fell over the courtroom as the defense lawyer rose, his face etched with a cryptic smile. He called upon the surprise eyewitness, who entered the room with a confident stride. With the appearance of this unexpected character, it seemed like the course of the trial was about to change drastically, adding a completely new dimension to the narrative. Everyone was on edge, wondering what revelations this newfound witness would unfold.
D. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident.

48,John studied all throughout college in the hopes of landing a good job. He made sacrifices and put in a lot of hard work.,"John had a clear goal in mind when he stepped onto the college campus for the first time; he wanted to land a good job after graduation. He understood that achieving this goal would require more than just passing his exams; he'd need to fully dedicate himself to his studies. Determined to succeed, he tirelessly hit the books every day, absorbing as much knowledge as he could from his professors.

Along the way, he was compelled to make several sacrifices. Socializing with friends often took a backseat, as John prioritized his studies above everything else. Long nights that should've been spent enjoying his youth were instead devoted to honing his skills and expanding his knowledge. 

Weekend trips, parties, and late-night hangouts were turned down, only fueling his reputation as the hardworking and focused individual. His hard work, however, did not go unnoticed. His professors often praised him for his diligence, with some even predicting a promising future for him in his chosen field.

In the end, his perseverance paid off. John graduated at the top of his class and managed to land a lucrative job in a prestigious company. His college years may have been spent mostly with his nose buried in books, but he knew that every sacrifice he made was worth the success he had achieved.","A. From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.
B. In a small village in Northern Italy, life was simple but rigorous, governed by the seasons and the necessities they imposed. For years, the villagers had been content with their uncomplicated lives, and they worked just as hard as it was necessary for them. One day, a rumor started circulating about a potential drought that would devastate their fields and cripple their livelihoods. People were initially skeptical; they didn't believe that their blessed lands could betray them in such a cruel manner.

But as the days grew hotter and hotter, the threat became palpable. The previously calm villagers were now fearful, their dreams haunted by barren fields and an empty harvest. The villagers knew it was necessary for them to work harder than ever before. They worked their hardest to build a water reservoir to store as much rainwater as possible for their thirsty crops. Men, women, and children worked day and night, their sweat-drenched bodies aching with exertion but refusing to give in.

In the end, their hard work paid off. When the drought came, their crops survived, and they understood a profound truth; people work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.
C. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.
D. For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me.

49,"The director finally completed the film, having done everything in his power to get the film released and bankrupting his production company.","Leonard Vincent, an ambitious and tenacious director, had finally completed his most personal film to date. The journey had been long, fraught with a myriad of challenges and setbacks that seemed to conspire against the film's completion. A series of unfortunate events from delayed schedules, increasingly demanding actors, to a catastrophic storm, disrupting the sets. Yet, Leonard showed unyielding determination, devoting every ounce of energy he had in his pursuit.

He poured all resources into the film, driven by the conviction of his creative vision. He believed that this film, this raw, unfettered expression of his soul, had the potential to shift perspectives and change lives. His investment didn't just confine to financial; he put his time, sweat, and heart into it, doing everything within his power to get the film released.

However, the immense expenditure led to an unexpected consequence, driving his production company to the brink of bankruptcy. Leonard had recklessly gambled everything, from his reputation to his financial stability, on a single film. Now with the film completed, he could only hope that his sacrifice would not be in vain, that the film would resonate with the audiences, redeeming his company from the precipice of financial ruin.","A. Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.
B. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
C. ""I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is!"" I exclaimed, incredulous that my American cousin, Ben, didn't recognize such a prominent name. Ben, having been raised on American football, had only a passing acquaintance with the world of soccer. 

""He is one of the greatest football players alive,"" I told him, trying to impress upon him the importance of Ronaldo. Ben shrugged, appearing only mildly interested. ""Football, as in soccer?"" he asked, and I nodded, astonished at his lack of knowledge.

""Let me paint a picture for you,"" I started, desperately trying to bridge the cultural gap between us. ""Ronaldo is to football what Michael Jordan is to basketball. He's a phenomenon, a once-in-a-generation player, who has taken the sport to new levels with his skill, athleticism, and sheer determination.""

""His speed, his agility, his ability to control the ball as if it was an extension of his own body, is unmatched,"" I continued. ""And that’s why he is considered a legend."" After hearing all this, Ben seemed to grasp the significance of Ronaldo a little bit more. He promised to check out some of Ronaldo's matches on the internet, signaling the small victory of international sports exchange.
D. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.",D,"#1 A

50,"I have set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday and I am working for it hook, line and sinker.","For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me. I had done it; I had conquered the spreadsheets, and most importantly, my fear of numbers.","A. Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.
B. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
C. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.
D. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
51,I am determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch this time no matter how difficult it is.,"As October turned into November, I could feel an excitement and slight nervousness bubbling up within me. This year was going to be different because for the first time, I was determined to cook the Thanksgiving dinner from scratch. Always intimidated by the thought of preparing such a large and traditional meal, I had always opted to order from the local deli or have the family gathering at a restaurant. But not this time, I wanted to bring a personal touch to our family gathering.

My plan was to start with the turkey, then the stuffing, followed by the cranberry sauce, and finish off with an assortment of delightful sides and desserts. Even though it was a mammoth task, I was ready for the challenge. I spent days researching recipes, procuring the freshest ingredients, and practicing my carving skills.

The day arrived, and I was filled with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. It was indeed a whirlwind of activity with the kitchen filled with a delicious aroma, family laughter echoing in the background, and the soulful melody of Thanksgiving songs. At the end of the day, despite the difficulties, the joy I saw on my family's faces while devouring the meal made it all worthwhile. I knew then that it was the beginning of a beautiful tradition, a gesture of love that would be remembered and relished for years to come.","A. Daniel had always dreamed of attending a prestigious university to fulfill his ambitions in computer science. This particular university was famed for its cutting-edge curriculum and boasted faculty with Silicon Valley experience. His academics were good, but he knew competition was fierce and this university only accepted the best of the best. The admission process was rigorous, and Daniel had spent sleepless nights preparing for it.

When he finally submitted his application, he could only pray and hope his efforts would pay off. He spent weeks in nervous anticipation, each day intensifying his anxiety. The day finally arrived when he received an email from the university. His heart pounded in his chest as he opened it, slowly reading the contents.

He made the final cut to the university, just by a small margin. Overwhelmed with joy, he jumped in exhilaration, his dream was now within his reach, and it was a testament to his hard work and determination.
B. Jake, a friend of mine, had been trapped in the 12th grade for the last five years. His academic journey had been a rollercoaster ride, filled with numerous obstacles and failures. It seemed like the universe was conspiring to prevent Jake from achieving his dream of graduating high school. Every year, he would start the academic term with a fervor, attending classes, participating actively, and submitting all his assignments on time. 

However, as the school year wore on, he would lose his momentum, often finding himself unable to keep up with his classmates. This became a recurring pattern, earning him the dubious honor of being the oldest student in our grade. His spirit was dampened, but his determination to pass was unwavering. He enlisted tutors, spent countless hours studying and sought advice from previous graduates.

Finally, in his sixth attempt, the persistent efforts of Jake bore fruit. With a weary yet triumphant smile, Jake held up his high school diploma, finally succeeding to pass the 12th grade, proof that persistence and dedication can overcome even the toughest of hurdles.
C. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.
D. Harry was a dedicated young athlete with a dream; a dream to win the prestigious city marathon. All his life, he had been waiting for this moment, the moment when he could finally prove his worth to himself and to the world around him. He knew that if he wanted to win, he couldn't leave any stone unturned. He would have to prepare tirelessly for the final race, putting each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Every morning, before the sun dared to peep over the horizon, Harry would lace up his running shoes and head for the trails. He took on steep hills, rough terrains and practiced in every weather condition - rain, sunshine, and snow alike. Every drop of sweat that gushed down his face represented his dedication and hard work, only fueling his determination further. He balanced this strenuous training with a well-disciplined diet and sleep schedule.

On rest days, he visualized himself crossing the finish line first, basking in the glory of his hard work.

Once upon a time, Olive was a commonly discussed name at the family's dinner table. He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

After that, no one in the family spoke about Olive anymore. Over time, he became the ""black sheep,"" the name that was avoided in conversations, the son who had stained their good name. Despite the love they once had for him, Olive's actions had ultimately led to his exclusion from the family.
B. Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.

D. Sally was usually a shy and introverted person. She preferred solitude to gatherings and found people tiresome. However, there was one person that Sally enjoyed being around. Sharon was her best friend, her confidant, the only person that could bring out the true Sally.

Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy. 

However, one day, she stumbled upon an article with the title: ""Don't trust everything on social media."" Intrigued, Emily delved deeper. The article pointed out that many posts on social media are often enhanced, staged, or even completely fake. It pointed out the ubiquity of photo-editing apps and deceitful captions used by people to portray a better version of their lives. The realization hit Emily like a ton of bricks.

From that day forward, Emily took every glamorous post she saw with a grain of salt, knowing they could be far removed from reality. She no longer allowed herself to be bogged down by the apparent euphoria exhibited by others online, instead focusing on building her own contentment in the real world. It was a simple reminder, but one that brought her a great deal of peace: social media is a deceptive lens, and life behind the screen isn't always as perfect as it seems.
B. After years of oscillating on various projects and careers, I had finally committed myself to a cause I believed in. It was not merely a project, it was a dream; an aspiration that I had carried in my heart for what felt like an eternity.

I could clearly envisage the path ahead of me, peppered with challenges and obstacles. Yet, the inherent value of the work outweighed any adversity I might encounter. The project was complex, sure, but it was deeply exciting and promised to be profoundly rewarding.

The journey was sure to be strenuous, maybe even overwhelming at times, but I was steadfast in my determination. The project would be my top priority, and I was ready to do anything to get the work done. I was resolved to translate my dream into reality, to transform my vision into a tangible, successful outcome.
C. Lisa loved her books like they were her own children. She had a dedicated room filled with shelves stacked with every kind of book imaginable. From classic literature to edgy, contemporary novels, her library was her personal sanctuary.

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation. This incident made Lisa realize that she had to set boundaries for her library, even with her closest friends.

54,I was completely against nationalization. I resisted it wholeheartedly even though I became quite unpopular in the process.,"From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling. The concept of the government taking over privately-owned industries was deeply unsettling to me. It wasn't just a matter of economic principles; it was an assault on individual freedoms.

As a vocal critic, I resisted nationalization wholeheartedly. I wrote articles, gave speeches, and even attended heated political debates. I tried to warn others about the dangers of state ownership, how it discourages innovation, stifles competition, and potentially jeopardizes the rights of workers and consumers.

However, my unpopular stance made me an outsider. My acquaintances viewed my resistance as a lack of patriotism or a result of selfish capitalist views. In the process, I became quite unpopular, isolated from those who once respected me.

However, I chose to stand by my principles. I refused to bend to the popular opinion. I felt it was more important to defend what I believed to be true than to be popular. If anything, the experience hardened my resolve and confirmed to me the importance of holding firm to one's convictions, regardless of the cost.","A.

Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.
B. Ever since I can remember, I've yearned for a place to call my own. The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize. 

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

However, I've come to terms with my situation, understanding that this is just a stepping stone towards achieving my dream. I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate.
C. In the heart of a cozy, rustic kitchen sat a pot-bellied, old-fashioned stove. It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.
D. In the small town of Baker's Crest, people lived simple lives, mostly untouched by the allure of wealth and luxury. The quiet town was buzzing one day with the news of a travelling merchant who claimed to sell ""real gold"" artifacts. The townspeople gathered at the market square, attracted by the glinting objects displayed on his cart. 

The items glittered under the sunlight, their sheen unmatched, making everyone believe they were indeed made of gold. The merchant, a persuasive man, told captivating tales of the artifacts being lost treasures of ancient kings. An air of greed and desire blew over the town, as everyone wanted a piece of this assumed wealth. They traded their hard-earned savings for the glittering items, believing they had struck a fortune. 

It was not until a wise old man from the town examined the artifacts closely and declared them to be mere brass, cleverly polished to resemble gold. All the glitter had indeed fooled them, reinforcing the adage, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The realization dawned, leaving the townspeople embarrassed, having learned their lesson the hard way.",A,"#A, #B, #C, #D

The answer is: #A

Explanation: The sentence ""From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling."" is the most analogous to the target sentence. It is a sentence that expresses a strong opinion or belief about a topic, in this case, nationalization. The other sentences do not have the same level of strong opinion or belief, and they do not express a personal perspective or viewpoint."
55,Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise.,"Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. He had several lucrative offers from other employers who were impressed by his skills and potential, but he declined them all. He was a man on a mission, determined to become part of Frank’s company, irrespective of the role he had to take up.

He reached out to Frank multiple times, explaining his passion, but never received a response. Larry, however, was not disheartened. He persisted, continually improving his skills and hoping that someday, he would get the opportunity to work with his idol, unswayed by the tempting offers that could have led him down a different path.","A. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.
B. My heart skips a beat every time I imagine myself skydiving. The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
C. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
D. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room.

56,"The drawing shows me at one glance, what a book can only show me in many pages.","Ever since I was a little kid, I've always had an insatiable curiosity for the world. My parents tried to answer my million questions, but they often found it hard to explain certain concepts to me. Then, they began showing me pictures and drawings, and that was when my understanding grew. I remember distinctly, the drawing that introduced me to the concept of the solar system.

The drawing showed me at one glance, what a book could only show me in many pages. At first glance, I saw colorful planets orbiting a radiant sun, each with their own distinct patterns and sizes. The earth, a blue dot, placed third from the sun made me comprehend our position in the universe. The distinct rings of Saturn, the redness of Mars, the size of Jupiter, all seemed to tell their own story.

Those simple illustrations sparked a fascination in me for the cosmos and it was far more effective than any description in a book. Thus, a picture became my stepping stone to the infinite world of knowledge, proving that sometimes, one glance can offer insight a thousand words may fail to give.","A. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

B. John and Sarah had been married for five years. The initial honeymoon phase faded away, and they started noticing each other's flaws and quirks. Small issues like not putting the toilet seat down or forgetting to pick up groceries on the way home, which used to go unnoticed, were now turning into a cause of frequent squabbles.

One day, their mutual friend Mike noticed the tension between them. He advised them to address and resolve these small issues before they grow into bigger problems. Mike reminded them of the love they shared and suggested focusing on open communication to understand each other's perspective.

Taking Mike's advice to heart, John and Sarah started resolving each small issue immediately instead of letting it fester. They openly discussed their expectations, frustrations, and found ways to compromise. Over time, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their relationship. This made them realize that resolving small issues immediately indeed prevented bigger troubles down the road.
C. John had always been a hard worker, who believed in doing things right the first time. He had a mantra: doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run. Every task he took on, he ensured it was done with meticulous care and attention. 

One day, he was assigned a complex project at work. His colleagues, Mike and Nancy, believed in taking shortcuts to finish the tasks quickly. They mocked John for his painstaking approach. John, however, didn't let their mockery deter him and he continued with his methodical approach. 

Weeks later, the project was presented to their boss. Mike and Nancy's hasty work resulted in many errors, leading to the project being sent back for corrections. John, on the other hand, had a flawless presentation, which not only impressed the boss, but also earned him a promotion. His mantra had once again proven to be true; doing your work thoroughly and responsibly really did help him avoid problems in the long run.
D. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.",A,s and the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day after the other day the other the other the other the other the other the other the the other the other the the other the the other the the other the the other the other the the other the the the other the other the the the the the the the the other the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
57,I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on.,"As an avid movie lover, I've always appreciated the beauty of cinema more than literature. A couple of weeks ago, my friend, a passionate reader, recommended an epic fantasy series to me. She exclaimed, ""You just have to read these books. The story is enchanting!"" However, the thought of reading five massive volumes was daunting. Each book, she said, was a thousand pages of intricate world-building, nuanced character development, and twisting plotlines. The time commitment alone was overwhelming. 

With some research, I discovered that a film adaptation had been made of the entire series. It intrigued me more than the prospects of wading through stacks of books. So, I decided to spare myself the cumbersome task of reading the novels and simply watch the adaptation. ""I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on,"" I informed her, much to her horror and my relief.","A. My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.

C. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.
D. Frank, my old buddy from college, has always been somewhat technophobic. Whenever the topic of computers or technology came up, he would always wave it off, saying it was too daunting for him. He found the idea of delving into the labyrinth of code to create a functioning computer program particularly intimidating. This avoidance of technology was surprising since Frank was always up for challenges in other areas of his life.

Then, something unusual happened the last time we met. Frank surprised everyone by proclaiming that he was finally ready to conquer his fear of technology. He confidently announced that he would attempt to write his first computer program. The proclamation came out of nowhere, catching everyone, including me, off guard.

We had all gotten used to Frank's refusal to dip his toes in the world of technology, so this sudden shift was undoubtedly unexpected. However, it was also encouraging to see him willing to step out of his comfort zone. Frank's decision marked a new chapter in his life, and we were all eager to see how this turn of events would unfold.",B,"s and the other day.

58,A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.,"As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.","A. Ron had always been the free spirit in his family, having no major responsibilities or commitments to worry about. Unlike his older siblings, who were all burdened with jobs, education, and family commitments, Ron's lifestyle seemed to be worry-free. His family and friends saw him as an amusing diversion from their own responsibilities, and his lack of any real obligations became a sort of running joke. 

Amid the laughter and banter, Ron realized that he was relegated to the role of the family clown, making others laugh but never given the chance to prove himself otherwise. He felt that his capability to handle complex situations was overlooked, unappreciated even. Thus, he decided to prove his ability in a rather unconventional manner - pranks.

Ron began devising detailed and complex pranks that required a lot of planning and execution. He wanted these pranks to reflect his creativity and strategic thinking, a demonstration of his potential if given actual responsibilities. Each prank, meticulously planned, and well-executed, started to earn him notoriety amongst his friends and family.

Eventually, people began to notice the complexity and detail behind his pranks, starting to appreciate the potential Ron was aiming to showcase. Through his unconventional approach, Ron had managed to turn his lack of responsibilities into a platform to illustrate his capabilities in managing complex tasks.

C. Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.
D. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire. Meet James Harrison, a self-made millionaire who lives in New York City. He made his fortune in the tech industry but chose to remain humble and unassuming despite his wealth. 

Every morning, he puts on the same attire: a plain black t-shirt, khaki pants, and worn-out sneakers. To the average eye, he appears to be just another face in the crowd. He spends his days not in opulent boardrooms, but rather in quaint cafes, where he is always absorbed in either a novel or his laptop, ever curious and eager to learn. 

James prefers solitude and discretion over the fanfare associated with high society. He believes that true worth isn't measured by the price tag on your clothes but by the richness of your character and the value you bring to society. At the end of the day, James Harrison, in his simple clothes, is far more than a millionaire; he's a millionaire with a purpose.",B,"#1 New York Times, 1969

He was highly respected in his field, winning cases with an uncanny ease and expertise. However, he grew tired of the endless lawsuits, the constant debating, and the late-night preparation for trials. He yearned for a drastic change, something that could offer him a chance at a different lifestyle.

One day, Robert made a decision that shocked his colleagues. He quit his prestigious job as a lawyer and decided to return to university to obtain an MBA degree. He believed this degree would offer him better job opportunities and a less stressful life. The idea of working within a corporate environment, negotiating deals, and creating business strategies excited him.

However, his aspirations soon met with a harsh reality. After graduating, he found himself lost in an oversaturated job market, struggling to find a place where his new skill set would be valued as much as his old one. He began to realize that every career had its challenges, and it wasn't about chasing what seemed to be better, but rather, finding contentment in what one already has. His journey to become an MBA graduate, although enlightening, did not provide the solution he had hoped for.
B. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
C. For as long as they had known each other, Sam had been supportive, understanding, and incredibly patient with Peter. They shared many moments together, both good and bad, which had made them close friends. Despite the ups and downs in their friendship, Sam had always tried to be a good friend to Peter. She was willing to look past Peter's idiosyncrasies, as that's what friends do.

However, one day, Peter crossed a line. During one of their usual chats, he started making fun of Sam's insecurities. Sam had confided in him about her fears and self-doubts, trusting him not to use them against her. But Peter decided to poke fun at them, laughing at her apprehensions while completely disregarding her feelings.

The hurtful incident made Sam reassess their friendship. She decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore, realizing that a true friend would not use her vulnerabilities as a source of amusement. From then on, Sam distanced herself from Peter, deciding to surround herself with people who respected her feelings and insecurities.
D. The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions.

60,It is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at the event.,"Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.","A. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
B. Mary was a visual learner. Ever since her early days in school, she always found it easier to understand concepts that were depicted visually. It didn't matter if it was a complex math problem or a biological cycle, diagrams always spoke to her more clearly than words ever could. 

This unique trait of hers didn't change even when she embarked on her journey as a mechanical engineer. In fact, it became even more pronounced. She would often find herself in her lab, surrounded by textbooks with lengthy paragraphs describing various mechanical processes. 

But she hardly paid any attention to those words. Instead, her eyes would always drift towards the diagrams that represented the processes. They gave her a better and more complete idea of what was going on. For Mary, diagrams were not just illustrations, but a powerful medium that enabled her to grasp and master the intricacies of mechanical engineering. 

Her peers often ridiculed her and called her 'diagram-obsessed.' But she didn't mind. She knew her strengths and preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them. After all, it was this unique learning style of hers that helped her stand out and excel in her field.
C. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.
D. Alex had always been a hard worker. He had spent most of his adult life working low-paying jobs, scrimping and saving every penny to get by. He would see his friends enjoying their life with grand parties and expensive drinks, but he could only dream of such extravagances. 

One day, he was finally able to secure a high-paying job after years of struggle and dedication. The feeling was surreal, it felt like a weight lifted off his shoulders. For Alex, it was more than just earning money, it was about finally being able to afford the life he wanted. 

As he received his first paycheck, he decided to treat himself. Without wasting any time, he spent all his money on drinks and parties. He invited all his friends and enjoyed to the fullest, living the life he had yearned for so long. Alex wanted to relish this newfound freedom, to enjoy his life now without any restrictions.

My parents tried to answer my million questions, but they often found it hard to explain certain concepts to me. Then, they began showing me pictures and drawings, and that was when my understanding grew. I remember distinctly, the drawing that introduced me to the concept of the solar system.

The drawing showed me at one glance, what a book could only show me in many pages. At first glance, I saw colorful planets orbiting a radiant sun, each with their own distinct patterns and sizes. The earth, a blue dot, placed third from the sun made me comprehend our position in the universe. The distinct rings of Saturn, the redness of Mars, the size of Jupiter, all seemed to tell their own story.

Those simple illustrations sparked a fascination in me for the cosmos and it was far more effective than any description in a book. Thus, a picture became my stepping stone to the infinite world of knowledge, proving that sometimes, one glance can offer insight a thousand words may fail to give.
B. The match was in Philadelphia; the city was charged with excitement and anticipation. The game was baseball, Philadelphia's own Phillies against their formidable opponent, the Dodgers. The stadium was swarming with fans, both sides buzzing with unbridled excitement.

From the first inning, it was evident that the game would be no cakewalk for either team. The Phillies displayed an impeccable form, their pitcher hurling the baseball with precision and speed. However, the Dodgers were just as tenacious. With every pitch, they countered with agility, their bats swishing through the air, keeping the score neck-and-neck. 

As the game extended into the ninth inning, it became clear that victory was within reach for both teams. The Phillies, however, drew upon a surge of energy and managed to score a critical run. Though the Dodgers were just as good and came close to the win, their efforts fell short. In the end, it was Philly who clinically secured the game, much to the delight of their home crowd.
C. Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick. To sell his story, he even shared details of a make-believe doctor's visit and incessantly discussed his fictional symptoms. This charade continued for an entire week while his boss unknowingly covered his workload. 

Upon his return, Andy confidently strolled into the office, expecting his little ruse to have gone undetected. However, his boss, Mrs. Thompson, had been contacted by a mutual friend who had spotted Andy lounging on a beach during his supposed sick leave. In a short, tense meeting, Mrs. Thompson voiced her disappointment and warned Andy about his position in the company, reminding him that trustworthiness was critical.

Andy, realizing the severity of his actions, found himself teetering on very thin ice. His boss's rebuke had made clear that another transgression could cost him his job. Determined to make amends, Andy began formulating a plan to regain Mrs. Thompson's trust and save his reputation at work.
D. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.",A,s.

62,"I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.","Ever since I can remember, I've yearned for a place to call my own. The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize. 

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate.","A. After years of oscillating on various projects and careers, I had finally committed myself to a cause I believed in. It was not merely a project, it was a dream; an aspiration that I had carried in my heart for what felt like an eternity. This time, I decided I would see the project through, no matter what it took. 

I could clearly envisage the path ahead of me, peppered with challenges and obstacles. Yet, the inherent value of the work outweighed any adversity I might encounter. The project was complex, sure, but it was deeply exciting and promised to be profoundly rewarding.

I was willing to put in late hours, to work through weekends if necessary. In fact, I was prepared to go beyond my physical and mental boundaries, to stretch my limits. There would be no room for procrastination or distractions in my life.

The journey was sure to be strenuous, maybe even overwhelming at times, but I was steadfast in my determination. The project would be my top priority, and I was ready to do anything to get the work done. I was resolved to translate my dream into reality, to transform my vision into a tangible, successful outcome.
B. President Jack Bryan had achieved a level of popularity unmatched by any of his predecessors in his term. His policies had lifted the nation from an economic downturn, his charismatic speeches united a previously divided people, and his transparent leadership earned him unwavering trust. The nation adored him, his approval ratings consistently soaring to incredible heights. However, he was also a firm believer in the power and necessity of democratic processes.

Jack Bryan respected the constitution more than anything, viewing it as the backbone of their nation's democratic values. Despite public clamor for him to serve another term, he was adamant about stepping down at the end of his term. The constitution allowed a president to serve only two consecutive terms, and he had already served his.

As the end of his term approached, his retirement speech became a much-anticipated event. He addressed the nation, thanking them for their support, urging them to maintain unity, and encouraging them to respect the constitutional process. He retired with grace and dignity, cementing his legacy as a president who was not only greatly loved but also deeply respected for upholding the constitution. Despite the nation's wish for him to stay on, they held great respect for his firm stand on constitutional adherence.
C. In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.
D. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
63,"That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself, but, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now.","I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.","A. Jake might look confused all the time, his eyebrows perpetually furrowed, his gaze constantly lost somewhere far beyond the present. Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.

C. Congressman Bernard Foster was an ambitious man, driven by his desire to bring about effective change in his beloved state. For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.
D. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.",B,"#1. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the two variables. The independent variable is X, and the dependent variable is Y. The independent variable is the number of hours of exercise per week, and the dependent variable is the weight of the person.

The data is as follows:

X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Y = 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84

The correlation coefficient is 0.9998.

The equation of the line of best fit is:

Y = 0.9998X + 72

This equation shows that for every additional hour of exercise per week, the weight increases by 0.9998 pounds.

The equation can also be written in the form:

Y = aX + b

where a is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

In this case, a = 0.9998 and b = 72.

Therefore, the equation of the line of best fit is Y = 0"
64,"I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.","Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.","A. John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.
B. Ever since she got her first smartphone, Emily had spent countless hours scrolling through endless social media feeds. There, she often found herself submerged in a world where everyone was seemingly living a life far more exciting than hers. Glimpses of friends traveling the world, acquaintances reveling in expensive parties and distant relatives flaunting their possessions filled her screen, creating a feeling of envy and inadequacy. 

However, one day, she stumbled upon an article with the title: ""Don't trust everything on social media."" Intrigued, Emily delved deeper. The article pointed out that many posts on social media are often enhanced, staged, or even completely fake. It pointed out the ubiquity of photo-editing apps and deceitful captions used by people to portray a better version of their lives. The realization hit Emily like a ton of bricks.

From that day forward, Emily took every glamorous post she saw with a grain of salt, knowing they could be far removed from reality. She no longer allowed herself to be bogged down by the apparent euphoria exhibited by others online, instead focusing on building her own contentment in the real world. It was a simple reminder, but one that brought her a great deal of peace: social media is a deceptive lens, and life behind the screen isn't always as perfect as it seems.

D. Amy was well-aware of the ticking clock, yet she was still miles away from completing her assigned homework. As the time continued to slip from her hands, she started to feel a surge of panic. Unable to finish the task on time, she pondered over her possible options. Among her choices was an old cliché: the classic ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. She knew it was a bold lie, her pet was an ageing Labrador, Bailey, who barely had the energy to play fetch, let alone eat her paperwork.

Despite her awareness of how false it sounded, Amy decided to pitch this excuse to her professor. She stood in front of him, putting on an expression of sorrow and disappointment. ""Professor,"" she started, ""my dog ate my homework."" 

However, her professor, a seasoned educator with years of experience, was not convinced. He looked at her through his spectacles and decided to penalize her for not only failing to submit the work on time, but also for attempting to deceive him. Amy learned her lesson that day: excuses, especially the ludicrous ones, seldom save the day.",C,#B
65,I wanted to go out for dinner but I had no money and had to eat the left-over rice from last night.,"I had a particular craving for Italian food that evening. The rich taste of pasta tossed in the savory tomato sauce and the enticing aroma of the herbs was something I wanted to treat myself with. I checked my wallet and felt my heart sink. 

It was nearly empty, devoid of the cash I needed for such an expensive indulgence. The disappointment was overwhelming, but I tried to console myself with the thought that at least I had something to eat at home. As I opened the fridge, I saw it. A small container with left-over rice from last night's dinner was sitting there, patiently waiting for me.

I sighed, the contrast between my wishful thinking and reality was indeed harsh. With a heavy heart, I heated up the rice and sat down to eat. I kept dreaming about Italian food, but I had to make do with what I had. I made a promise to myself, one day I would be able to afford that dinner without worrying about my wallet.","A. Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between hills, a young boy named Max lived with his parents. He was a clever lad, always curious about the world around him. One day, his best friend, Danny, came to him with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. He suggested they steal apples from Mr. Johnson's orchard, as many other kids had done it before.

Max felt a rush of excitement at the idea, but at the same time, he knew it was wrong. He thought back to the lessons his parents had always taught him about right and wrong. He remembered them telling him, ""It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it."" 

With his parents' words echoing in his mind, Max looked at Danny and shook his head. He explained to Danny that stealing was wrong, no matter how many others were doing it. From that day on, Max always stood up for what was right, teaching his friends along the way about the importance of morality over popularity.
B. Ramos was a well-established author known for his profound and thought-provoking novels. Over the past months, he had been painstakingly piecing together his latest literary masterpiece. Yet, every time he tried to find the quiet focus he needed to finish his project, a string of disturbances impeded his progress.

He was unable to concentrate with the hustle and bustle of city life that invaded his quiet work space. Between the phone ringing off the hook and constant knocks at his door, peace was a luxury he couldn't afford. His patience waning, Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, far away from these distractions. 

He knew of an old rustic cabin located in the heart of a peaceful forest. The cabin was devoid of any signs of modern life - no phone, no internet, no television. It was his sanctuary, a place where he could shut out the world and dive deep into his imagination. So, he packed his essentials, manuscripts in tow, and headed to the cabin where no one could disturb him.
C. Mary had a fond affection for dogs and had adopted two, Charlie and Lucy. Charlie was a large, energetic labrador while Lucy was a playful, medium-sized collie. Together, they brought a lot of joy and sometimes chaos to Mary's life. However, one thing that bothered Mary was that her dear pets did not have a proper place to rest or shelter.

She had been dreaming of a comfortable and spacious dog house for them, an oasis where they could retreat in the middle of their fun-filled day. However, building a large dog house was not something within Peter's financial capacity. He had been working hard but money seemed to just slip out of his hands like sand. Yet, he knew how much it meant for Mary to give Charlie and Lucy a cozy home.

With a spark of an idea, Mary decided not to rely on Peter's wallet, but on her creativity and resourcefulness. With a bunch of old cardboard boxes she had kept from moving in, Mary set to work, designing and building a large, multi-roomed dog house for Charlie and Lucy, making the best out of what they had at their disposal.
D. Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it. My heart pounding in my chest will slowly become a normal rhythm, my fear will turn into a certain caution, and my journey, a routine I follow, unfazed. The darkness won't be a cause for terror anymore. Instead, the quiet streets will make me feel independent and strong.",C,"s and the other day.

66,Mary wanted a big dog house for the dogs but Peter couldn't afford to build her one so she made one from the carboard boxes.,"Mary had a fond affection for dogs and had adopted two, Charlie and Lucy. Charlie was a large, energetic labrador while Lucy was a playful, medium-sized collie. Together, they brought a lot of joy and sometimes chaos to Mary's life. However, one thing that bothered Mary was that her dear pets did not have a proper place to rest or shelter.

She had been dreaming of a comfortable and spacious dog house for them, an oasis where they could retreat in the middle of their fun-filled day. However, building a large dog house was not something within Peter's financial capacity. He had been working hard but money seemed to just slip out of his hands like sand. Yet, he knew how much it meant for Mary to give Charlie and Lucy a cozy home.

With a spark of an idea, Mary decided not to rely on Peter's wallet, but on her creativity and resourcefulness. With a bunch of old cardboard boxes she had kept from moving in, Mary set to work, designing and building a large, multi-roomed dog house for Charlie and Lucy, making the best out of what they had at their disposal.","A. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.
B. Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike. To the world, we are two sides of the same coin, a study in contrast, but deep down, we are just two boys learning to navigate life in our unique ways.
C. The much-anticipated Friday afternoon had finally arrived, and to my pleasant surprise, I had no homework assigned for the weekend. I could feel a strange sense of freedom as I stepped off the school bus and took the familiar path to our house. Suddenly, the thought of having nothing to do turned into an exciting idea - I decided I'd devote the whole weekend to annoying my older brother, Jacob. Jacob was the typical older sibling, always bossy and never missing a chance to tease me.

I began crafting a meticulous plan, fueled by previous unsuccessful attempts to get back at him. My mind began to bubble with ideas - switching his toothpaste with mayonnaise, short-sheeting his bed, pretending to sneak up on him with a plastic spider. I carefully spent the entire Saturday preparing everything, secretly grinning to myself.

Sunday morning arrived, and I was all set to implement my genius plan. First, I woke up early and switched his toothpaste, trying my best to suppress my laughter as I imagined his reaction. As the day progressed, I was enjoying each of his bewildered reactions. By the end of the weekend, I had successfully pulled off all my tricks and enjoyed an entire weekend of hilarity at my brother's expense.
D. I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.",D,#A
67,"While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.","After weeks of hunting for a place to stay, I finally found a modest apartment. The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.","A. Many people often cringe when they hear about the color combination of orange and green. They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.
B. In this part of town, hidden away behind the bustling city life, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes. These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.
C. Sarah had always been a very self-critical person. After each job interview, she'd sit in her car replaying every detail, from the way she shook the interviewer's hand, to the tone in which she answered questions. She would often chastise herself for not using more impressive vocabulary or for failing to mention some minor accomplishment. ""There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview,"" her older brother advised, sensing her post-interview stress.

He reminded her that, once the interview was over, she could not change anything she'd said or done. All she could do was wait for a decision. ""Move on to the next one,"" he encouraged her, further explaining that dwelling on the past would only rob her of the focus and energy needed for upcoming opportunities. 

Trying to heed his advice, Sarah started to look ahead, preparing for her next interview instead of dwelling on the past ones. She realized that she could learn from her perceived mistakes and apply those lessons in the future. Eventually, she found that this forward-thinking strategy helped alleviate her post-interview stress and made her perform better in subsequent ones. The regret was replaced by a sense of learning and personal growth, which was a far more constructive approach.
D. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.",D,"#1 in the world.

68,"By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house.","For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.","A.

B. Lisa loved her books like they were her own children. She had a dedicated room filled with shelves stacked with every kind of book imaginable. From classic literature to edgy, contemporary novels, her library was her personal sanctuary.

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation. This incident made Lisa realize that she had to set boundaries for her library, even with her closest friends.
C. Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.
D. Jane has always seen things that others don't. Ever since childhood, she's been drawn to the unusual, the ordinary that's seen from an extraordinary lens. John, an average man in the eyes of the general public, caught her attention on a regular day at her usual coffee shop. He was standing behind the counter, blending with the mundane scene around him. But not for Jane.

From his ginger hair, slightly tousled, to his freckles adorning his face like constellations; everything about him was perfect to her. She saw the way his green eyes would light up when he made a good cup of coffee or the way his face crinkled up when he laughed. To her, he was a masterpiece, the embodiment of everything charming and attractive. She found herself falling for his uniqueness, his ordinariness that so many seemed to overlook.

Even though her friends saw him as nothing but an average joe, Jane cherished this man who, to her, stood out as the most attractive man in the world. Her heart fluttered every time she thought of him, every time she saw him. Because to her, he was more than just ordinary, he was extraordinary.",A,"```

69,"After losing half of the soldiers, they had no other option but to use the tank to fight.","The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.","A. The summer of 2016 was unforgettable, as it was filled with a fantastic vacation my family and I had been planning for months. We had decided to embark on a month-long exploration trip across Europe, seeing the sights and soaking in the culture of different countries. The first week was spent roaming the beautiful, love-filled streets of Paris, where we ascended the Eiffel Tower and indulged in scrumptious, traditional French cuisine. 

Our second destination was the historically rich city of Rome, Italy, where we marveled at the grandeur of the Colosseum and indulged in some of the best pizzas and pastas. After Italy, we moved on to Spain, where we enjoyed the lively Flamenco dances and the unique architecture in Barcelona. The magic of these experiences was amplified by the bond my family and I shared, as we created countless memories and grew closer with every passing day. 

As each day passed, our holiday got better, leaving us yearning for more adventures and experiences. Yet, the final week came all too soon, and we found ourselves back home, unpacking our suitcases and hanging up the photos we took. We sighed, missing the vibrancy and excitement that our vacation had brought. It was indeed a fantastic vacation, but as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.
B. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.
C. Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.

70,"As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.","Ever since my childhood, I've been told that every cloud has a silver lining. The truth of that adage never really struck me until a rainy day last June. My wife, Cindy, and I were supposed to catch an early morning flight for our anniversary getaway. However, due to an unforeseen traffic jam, we missed our flight and found ourselves stranded in the bustling terminal.

At first, we were fraught with frustration and disappointment, the holiday we planned so meticulously was slipping away. Yet, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. While waiting at the crowded coffee shop inside the airport, we crossed paths with a kind old man named Charlie.

We started talking and found out that Charlie was a veteran and had led a life full of adventures. He shared stories from his travels around the world, his life lessons, and his wisdom. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met Charlie, and our world would be a little less enriched. His stories and experiences, his wisdom and his kindness became the unexpected highlight of our anniversary.","A. Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.
B. We all begin our lives in the same humble manner, as innocent and inexperienced infants, new to the world and unaware of its complexities. From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.
C. Upon entering the room, I caught sight of you dancing ecstatically, waving a piece of paper in the air. It was evident in your twinkling eyes and flushed cheeks, something wonderful had occurred. I approached you, barely holding back a smile, curious about what had ignited such jubilation. 

You turned to me, out of breath but gleaming with happiness, holding out the letter that you had been clutching so tightly. I read the letter; it was a job offer from your dream company. “I can see that you are beside yourself with joy at being selected for the job,” I exclaimed with a chuckle. 

I pulled you into a warm hug, congratulating you heartily. It was a moment of genuine bliss, your relentless hard work and dedication had finally paid off. All your sleepless nights, the times of self-doubt, the perseverance, everything had culminated in this one triumphant moment. As I let you go, I saw a new spark in your eyes; you were ready to embark on this new journey, ready to make your mark on the world. 

Congratulations, my friend. Your victory was well-deserved.
D. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.",A,s and the 20s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s and the 2s the 2s and the 2s the 2s the 2s the 2s the 2s the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the 2 the
71,"Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made.","Vanessa had initially planned to cook her famous rosemary chicken for the birthday party. It was a recipe that had been passed down through generations in her family. Whenever she cooked it, the succulent taste of the chicken would leave everyone licking their fingers and asking for more.

However, when she went shopping for ingredients, she found that the supermarket was out of fresh chicken. It was a dilemma, indeed. She pondered over it, deciding what she could cook instead that would be just as impressive and satisfy all the birthday guests. 

After a moment of contemplation, she decided to prepare her grandmother's traditional Italian pasta recipe. As she got home, she swiftly began to cook, her kitchen soon filling up with the savory aromas of garlic and oregano.

As it turned out, the pasta was the star of the party. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made. Her unexpected dish not only won over the guests but also made for a memorable party everyone talked about for weeks.","A. For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.
B. Larry had been a lifelong fan of the mystery writer, Arthur K. Bennett. The intrigue and suspense in Bennett's novels have kept him awake for countless nights. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the annual 'Mystery Writers Meet,' he had yet to receive an invite. The event was an exclusive gathering of esteemed authors and their ardent fans, and invitations were notoriously hard to come by. 

He had tried for years, writing heartfelt letters to the organizers explaining his love for Bennett's work. Each year, he eagerly awaited a positive response, but it never came. Larry was beginning to lose hope when one day a golden envelope arrived in his mailbox. His heart pounded in his chest as he recognized the official seal of the 'Mystery Writers Meet' stamped on it.

Barely believing his eyes, Larry ripped open the envelope and there it was – a personalized invitation for him to attend the event. The anticipation bubbled in his chest as he realized he would finally have the chance to meet the man whose stories had captured his imagination for so many years.
C. My life took a catastrophic turn when I lost my home and possessions in a devastating fire. My life felt like it was a collapsed jenga tower; everything I had built, everything I owned, had turned to ash in one horrifying night. The incident left me both emotionally and financially broken. I had no family to return to, no childhood home to seek refuge in. 

In my darkest hour, an opportunity to start over knocked at my door. I accepted a job offer from an old friend who owned a company in Arkansas. Barely a month after the disaster, I packed what little I owned into my old car and started my journey to the 'Natural State.' It was a new beginning for me, a chance to rebuild from scratch in a place where no one knew about my tragedies.

A few months into my new life, on an impulsive whim, I bought a lottery ticket. The gods must have seen the trials I'd been through, or maybe luck just felt like it owed me one. Miraculously, I won the Arkansas state lottery. It was a joy beyond belief, a silver lining after a devastating storm. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery, turning my life around entirely.
D. Every day when she woke up, Jennifer looked through her window and admired her neighbor's home. She thought it was more attractive than her own whenever she turned to look at it. It was a resplendent Victorian mansion with an abundance of gables, a porch that wrapped around the entire front, and immaculate, manicured hedges that lined the driveway. There were vibrantly colored flowers placed expertly throughout the garden, and the white picket fence added an element of charm that she felt her own home lacked.

Jennifer's house, a modest bungalow, was far from unappealing, but paled in comparison to her neighbor's palatial abode. She spent countless hours fussing over her humble garden and undertaking DIY projects to make her home look more like the one across the street. Yet her efforts seemed to fall short every time.

One day, Jennifer struck up a conversation with her neighbor, Ms. Hawthorne. The older woman shared that the upkeep of her lavish home was quite demanding, requiring daily maintenance, considerable expenditure, and constant attention to detail. In that moment, Jennifer realized that while the neighbor's home may have been more attractive, it was certainly more difficult to keep up. She learned to appreciate her own home's charm, realizing its lower maintenance was a blessing in disguise.",C,"#1 New York City, NY, USA

72,It is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.,"I noticed you were pretty disappointed that you missed out on Jason's party last Saturday. Honestly, at first, I thought you would've had a great time there with all your friends. Jason's parties are always epic and you were looking forward to it all week. 

However, it turned out to be quite different this time. The music was ridiculously loud, louder than any party I've ever heard of, and it continued late into the night. The partygoers were enjoying themselves, completely oblivious to the disturbance they were causing. 

The otherwise calm and peaceful neighborhood couldn't bear the noise and chaos. It was Mr. Johnson, our next-door neighbor, who lost his patience first. Disturbed and frustrated, he decided to call the police. Hence, it is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.","A. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages. It was a sight that reminded Rory of the powerful bond of family, no matter how far apart they might be physically.
B. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.
C. For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.
D. Ever since my childhood, I've been told that every cloud has a silver lining. The truth of that adage never really struck me until a rainy day last June. My wife, Cindy, and I were supposed to catch an early morning flight for our anniversary getaway. However, due to an unforeseen traffic jam, we missed our flight and found ourselves stranded in the bustling terminal.

At first, we were fraught with frustration and disappointment, the holiday we planned so meticulously was slipping away. Yet, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. While waiting at the crowded coffee shop inside the airport, we crossed paths with a kind old man named Charlie.

We started talking and found out that Charlie was a veteran and had led a life full of adventures. He shared stories from his travels around the world, his life lessons, and his wisdom. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met Charlie, and our world would be a little less enriched. His stories and experiences, his wisdom and his kindness became the unexpected highlight of our anniversary.",D,"s program.

73,But if you look at the bright side you got to learn so much from the experience.,"John had always been passionate about starting his own business. After years of saving and planning, he finally launched his startup. The first few months were exciting and promising. However, the following year was fraught with unexpected challenges and unforeseen expenses.

He had invested not only his money but also his time and effort, and yet, he had to face the harsh reality of his startup failing. His friends tried to console him, but John was inconsolable. He felt he had lost everything.

One day, his old friend Peter visited him. After listening to John's woes, Peter said, ""I know it's tough, John. But if you look at the bright side, you got to learn so much from the experience. No business school would ever give you the kind of real-life lessons that you learned from running your own business."" Peter's words struck a chord, and John slowly began to see the silver lining. He had indeed gained invaluable insights that would certainly pave the way for his future endeavors.","A. Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.
B. Nina was not in the mood for distractions today, as she slipped on her headphones at her desk. Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.
C. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.

C. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.
D. The match was in Philadelphia; the city was charged with excitement and anticipation. The game was baseball, Philadelphia's own Phillies against their formidable opponent, the Dodgers. The stadium was swarming with fans, both sides buzzing with unbridled excitement.

From the first inning, it was evident that the game would be no cakewalk for either team. The Phillies displayed an impeccable form, their pitcher hurling the baseball with precision and speed. However, the Dodgers were just as tenacious. With every pitch, they countered with agility, their bats swishing through the air, keeping the score neck-and-neck. 

As the game extended into the ninth inning, it became clear that victory was within reach for both teams. The Phillies, however, drew upon a surge of energy and managed to score a critical run. Though the Dodgers were just as good and came close to the win, their efforts fell short.

75,"The painter did not have the yellow color with him so had to paint with red, making his painting famous for its unconventional choice.","Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.","A. Emily and John had been business partners for years and they always worked things out smoothly. But, this time it was different. It was about a business proposal that needed immediate attention and a crucial decision. John, out of over-confidence or ignorance, didn't discuss the problem with Emily right then and there.

Emily got the news the next day when the proposal fell apart. She was furious. ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" she lamented to John, her voice echoing throughout their office. She tried to keep her emotions under control, but it was difficult. ""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" she added, her eyes filled with a rare frustration.

John, understanding his lapse, felt guilt welling up inside him. He didn't want the partnership, built over mutual trust and understanding, to suffer due to his momentary lapse of judgment. He realized the need for immediate action to correct this error. In the silence of their office, he vowed to make things right, no matter how much effort it demanded from him. He hoped his efforts could preserve their relationship and rectify the problem he had caused in their business partnership.
B. John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.

D. James had been smoking for the last fifteen years, ever since he was a young, rebellious teenager. He tried numerous times to quit smoking, but each attempt ended with him lighting another cigarette. But this time was different; James was determined. The process of quitting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking, and James's desire was stronger than ever before.

One day, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and felt a deep distaste for the man he had become; his teeth were yellowing, his breath was constantly foul and his skin was aging prematurely. He saw himself slowly succumbing to the harmful effects of the cigarettes he was so addicted to. It was then he knew he had to make a change. He didn't want his life to be controlled by an addiction anymore.

James tossed his pack of cigarettes in the trash and promised himself that it would be his last. It was the first day of a tough journey, filled with withdrawal symptoms and endless cravings, but James was ready. The desire to quit was his driving force, and he was convinced that he would succeed this time. He had started the process and was ready to see it through to the end.",C,"and the other day after that.

76,A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.,"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.","A. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages. It was a sight that reminded Rory of the powerful bond of family, no matter how far apart they might be physically.
B. Chef Marco, an experienced professional with a taste for adventure, scanned his kitchen bustling with activity. He was used to a clientele that was more daring in their culinary tastes, always willing to try something new and exciting. Today, however, he found himself serving a less adventurous customer, someone who had no particular desire to explore the exotic and unusual dishes that were Chef Marco's specialty. He had no wish to force his culinary philosophy on anyone who was not willing to accept it.

With a sigh, Chef Marco took a step back, consulting his list of simpler recipes reserved for such instances. His eyes quickly scanned over the list, finally settling on the perfect dish - a classic beef stew with roasted vegetables, a comforting dish that was sure to satisfy. His hands started to move with an assured fluidity, expertly cutting the beef and vegetables into equal sizes, then browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables. 

He simmered everything in a robust broth, letting the aroma fill his kitchen. He knew this dish was a world away from his typical experimental recipes, but he also knew that sometimes, simplicity has its own charm. As he served the customer, he did so with the same level of pride, knowing that even with less adventurous dishes, his skills as a chef could still shine.
C. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.
D. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.",D,"#1 New York City, NY: Penguin Random House.

77,We all begin our lives as a baby and slowly learn and grow.,"We all begin our lives in the same humble manner, as innocent and inexperienced infants, new to the world and unaware of its complexities. From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.","A. Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.
B. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
C. In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house? Only time would tell.
D. Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.",A,"# 10.

78,"By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms.","In the beginning, Thomas wasn't certain of his capabilities in the field of programming. He was fascinated by the world of software development, yet felt intimidated by the intricate complexities that came with it. Algorithms and coding languages seemed like an alien language, filled with cryptic symbols and complicated frameworks.

One day, his mentor told him something that stuck with him: ""By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms."" Intrigued, Thomas decided to adopt this philosophy and made a gradual approach towards his learning. Instead of jumping straight into the complex coding paradigms, he started off with basic algorithms, writing simple code and familiarizing himself with the programming syntax. 

Over time, as his coding skills improved, Thomas began writing slightly more complicated code. With each passing day, he was becoming more and more adept at coding. Eventually, he found himself tackling complex algorithms with ease, his fear and anxiety replaced by confidence and determination. It turned out his mentor's advice was correct; starting with simple code was the key to eventually mastering the art of complex algorithm coding.","A. Once there was a young woman named Amelia, just entering her 20s. She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.
B. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics, seeing it merely as a jumble of numbers and variables that are not relatable to everyday life. Often, they regard math as a complicated series of equations and formulas to memorize. However, this perspective does not do justice to the richness and depth of this discipline. To me, mathematics is the most meaningful subject.

From an early age, I've always been fascinated by the harmony and precision found in mathematical concepts. The pure logic and absolute certainty captured in mathematical proofs provide a sense of satisfaction and comfort that no other subject can offer. As I manipulate figures and calculate equations, I feel a connection with the universe's fundamental laws and principles.

Every formula and theorem in mathematics reveals something profound about our world. It expresses abstract ideas like infinity and simplicity with an elegant language of numbers and symbols. Despite its complexity, the beauty of mathematics lies in its simplicity, consistency, and its ability to describe the world with absolute precision.

The process of solving a mathematical problem is like an exciting journey of discovery. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving a complex equation is unparalleled. This is the beauty I find in mathematics, making it, for me, the most meaningful subject.

D. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.",C,"```

They were a menacing force, relentless and ruthless, conducting their operations in the shadows. The mere thought of crossing paths with them was a nightmare. Yet, they had an individual on their radar, a man named Peter.

People thought it impossible to escape their relentless pursuit, but Peter was not ordinary. Peter, an unassuming yet resilient man, found himself caught up in their web. He was under constant surveillance, and any wrong move would have dire consequences.

One day, Peter received an anonymous tip-off about a plan to arrest him. It was then that he plotted his daring escape. Relying on his intelligence and quick thinking, Peter successfully managed to escape, narrowly avoiding their traps. The escape was far too close for comfort, giving him several heart-stopping moments, but he managed to slip away nonetheless. 

Word of Peter's daring escape spread among the citizens, igniting hope. While people had always believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter's audacious feat proved otherwise.
B. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality.

C. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
D. Frank had been all around the world, from bustling cities to desolate deserts, in pursuit of his career. A translator by profession, his work took him far and wide, away from the comfort of his small town in New Hampshire. Being a diligent and committed man, Frank invested years in adapting to diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. But, he always yearned for the familiarity and comfort of his hometown. 

One winter, after a decade overseas, Frank decided to return home. He was ecstatic as he packed his bags, each piece of clothing he folded bringing him one step closer to the solace he missed. The journey felt nostalgic as he drove through the sleepy lanes leading to his quaint wooden house. 

Finally, Frank found himself in his old room, staring at the childhood bed that bore witness to his dreams of adventure. The sight of the bed, washed in the soft, warm glow of his old table lamp, invited him with an embrace of familiarity. That night, he crawled under his worn-out quilt, and for the first time in years, Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed, surrounded by the soothing aura of his home country.",B,"C.

Both Hannah and the hiker are prepared for the unexpected and their journeys are marked by their commitment and dedication to their respective paths."
80,The process of quiting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking.,"James had been smoking for the last fifteen years, ever since he was a young, rebellious teenager. He tried numerous times to quit smoking, but each attempt ended with him lighting another cigarette. But this time was different; James was determined. The process of quitting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking, and James's desire was stronger than ever before.

One day, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and felt a deep distaste for the man he had become; his teeth were yellowing, his breath was constantly foul and his skin was aging prematurely. He saw himself slowly succumbing to the harmful effects of the cigarettes he was so addicted to. It was then he knew he had to make a change. He didn't want his life to be controlled by an addiction anymore.

James tossed his pack of cigarettes in the trash and promised himself that it would be his last. It was the first day of a tough journey, filled with withdrawal symptoms and endless cravings, but James was ready. The desire to quit was his driving force, and he was convinced that he would succeed this time. He had started the process and was ready to see it through to the end.","A.

B. John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.
C. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
D. For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.",A,A.

She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.
B. The boss of the packaging factory, Mr. Harrison, was known for his demanding work ethic. For him, the productivity of his factory was the top priority. So he set a rule for his workers: a minimum of 20 hours a week, no exceptions.

However, this rule wasn't welcomed warmly by the workers. The weekly shift was interfering with their personal lives and creating a stressful work environment. They protested against the rule, asking for more flexibility.

But Mr. Harrison didn't heed their concerns. Instead, he retorted, ""If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit."" This statement left the workers aghast. They were left pondering on the tough choice between their job and their well-being.
C. I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.
D. Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike.

82,People work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.,"In a small village in Northern Italy, life was simple but rigorous, governed by the seasons and the necessities they imposed. For years, the villagers had been content with their uncomplicated lives, and they worked just as hard as it was necessary for them. One day, a rumor started circulating about a potential drought that would devastate their fields and cripple their livelihoods. People were initially skeptical; they didn't believe that their blessed lands could betray them in such a cruel manner.

But as the days grew hotter and hotter, the threat became palpable. The previously calm villagers were now fearful, their dreams haunted by barren fields and an empty harvest. The villagers knew it was necessary for them to work harder than ever before. They worked their hardest to build a water reservoir to store as much rainwater as possible for their thirsty crops. Men, women, and children worked day and night, their sweat-drenched bodies aching with exertion but refusing to give in.

In the end, their hard work paid off. When the drought came, their crops survived, and they understood a profound truth; people work their hardest to attain something only when it is necessary for them.","A. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
B. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.
C. For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.
D. I'm a firm believer in the importance of a good work-life balance. However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question.

83,If my project partner hadn't gotten sick I never would have need to finish the entire assignment on my own by working day and night.,"As an engineering student, I had gotten used to unexpected challenges and pressure. Yet, I was not prepared for what happened during our final semester. My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.","A. The sweet aroma of vanilla wafted through the house, tantalizing everyone with its intoxicating fragrance. Sam was baking his famous vanilla pound cake for a Sunday family gathering. He had spent the entire morning stirring batter, adding ingredients, and pouring love into his baking. The time came for the much-anticipated cake to come out of the oven. 

""Remember kids, to avoid burning your hands, use oven mitts when removing the cake,"" he explained, ""as it will be hot unlike how it is now."" The children, enthralled by the baking process, paid heed to his words and scampered away to find the colorful oven mitts. With mitts in hand, they returned to Sam, eyes wide with excitement. 

Sam gently pulled the oven door open, the heat instantly warming the room. They carefully removed the golden brown cake, the heat seeping through the mitts as they held the tray. The sight of the perfectly baked cake made everyone's mouth water and they couldn't wait to taste it, knowing it would be as delicious as the previous ones.
B. Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy. This principle was engraved into his heart by his parents, especially when it came to his professional life. He knew that lying to land a job could possibly offer a temporary success but it certainly was not a sustainable solution.

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.

D. Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.",C,"s.

B. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.
C. In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house? Only time would tell.

C. In the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, Dan Murphy, a renowned music producer, was hard at work in his state-of-the-art recording studio. Amid the collection of records, tracks, and albums strewn about his desk, one particular task was causing him more distress than any other. It involved his least favorite client, a pompous pop star named Jimmy Sparkle who had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way.

Dan sifted through his vast collection of yet-to-be-released songs, attempting to find one suitable for his demanding client. He chuckled cynically, deciding to choose a tune that wasn't well-received in initial listening sessions. It was a less liked song, one that was penned for an indie artist but somehow didn't make the cut. He remembered the honest lyrics and quirky melody that was met with mixed responses - not all songs can please everyone, he thought.

Feeling a twisted satisfaction, Dan selected the track for Jimmy, the epitome of mainstream pop, a stark contrast to the spirit of the song. He burned the track onto a CD, the words 'New Single - Jimmy Sparkle' etched into it, then packed it away to send to the insufferable pop star. Perhaps, he thought, this could be an awakening for Jimmy, an opportunity for him to make something meaningful instead of his usual cookie-cutter pop. Or perhaps, it would be a disastrous mismatch that would humble him, either way, Dan felt it was a win-win situation for himself.

B. In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.
D. Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. He had several lucrative offers from other employers who were impressed by his skills and potential, but he declined them all. He was a man on a mission, determined to become part of Frank’s company, irrespective of the role he had to take up.

He reached out to Frank multiple times, explaining his passion, but never received a response. Larry, however, was not disheartened. He persisted, continually improving his skills and hoping that someday, he would get the opportunity to work with his idol, unswayed by the tempting offers that could have led him down a different path.",C,s of the 190s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10s of the 10 the 10 the 10 the
87,"Megan, a lousy student, worked twice as hard and revised her basics once she was told to mentor two new members of the team.","Megan had never really excelled in her studies. She was often described as a lousy student, failing more times than not in understanding complex theoretical concepts. However, everything changed when her team manager announced that she was to mentor two new members.

Shocked, she couldn't comprehend how she was supposed to teach when she herself was a laggard in her team. But she also felt a sense of responsibility. The realization that two people were depending on her to learn the ropes of the trade sparked a new determination in her. 

She began to work twice as hard to make up for her past negligence. She put extra hours into understanding the company's policies and the nitty-gritty of their operations. She went back to the basics, revised everything and gradually, her understanding of things improved. Her effort was not in vain as she transitioned from a lousy student to an effective mentor, proving that with hard work and dedication, any challenge can be overcome.","A. I'm a firm believer in the importance of a good work-life balance. However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question. But despite the exhaustion, I managed to meet each and every deadline, proving to myself that sometimes, bending the rules of work-life balance is necessary for success.
B. John had a clear goal in mind when he stepped onto the college campus for the first time; he wanted to land a good job after graduation. He understood that achieving this goal would require more than just passing his exams; he'd need to fully dedicate himself to his studies. Determined to succeed, he tirelessly hit the books every day, absorbing as much knowledge as he could from his professors.

Along the way, he was compelled to make several sacrifices. Socializing with friends often took a backseat, as John prioritized his studies above everything else. Long nights that should've been spent enjoying his youth were instead devoted to honing his skills and expanding his knowledge. 

Weekend trips, parties, and late-night hangouts were turned down, only fueling his reputation as the hardworking and focused individual. His hard work, however, did not go unnoticed. His professors often praised him for his diligence, with some even predicting a promising future for him in his chosen field.

In the end, his perseverance paid off. John graduated at the top of his class and managed to land a lucrative job in a prestigious company. His college years may have been spent mostly with his nose buried in books, but he knew that every sacrifice he made was worth the success he had achieved.
C. On Mike's most recent birthday, his boisterous and overly generous friend, Greg, had decided that a normal celebration was not going to cut it. Greg had been planning this night for weeks, thinking that excessive amounts of alcohol was just the thing Mike needed to let loose. He ordered round after round of drinks, each one a stronger mix than the last. Mike, usually the reserved type, was taken aback by this unusual display of extravagance from his friend but decided to go with the flow.

With each passing hour, the drinks kept coming, and Mike couldn't bring himself to say no. He laughed, engaged in boisterous conversations, danced wildly to music he normally would never listen to; he felt uninhibited, free in a way he hadn't experienced before. As the night wore on, however, the room started spinning faster, and his balance was thrown off. By the time the clock struck eleven, Mike was slumped over the bar counter, his eyes half-closed, and words slurred.

An hour short of midnight, Mike was unconscious, his head laid down on the table while laughter and music filled the air around him. Greg, realizing his friend had passed out, was filled with a mixture of concern and self-admonishment, regretting his decision to flood Mike with more drinks than he could handle.
D. ""Excuse me, sir,"" a small voice spoke out, trembling and filled with anxiety. The audience turned their heads to the stage, trying to locate the source of the interruption. A slender young man stood there, nervously shifting from foot to foot. His eyes were wide and filled with fear as he focused his gaze on the towering figure before him. 

""Do you know who you're facing?"" the young man's coach hastily whispered from the sidelines, panic coursing through his veins. He pointed a shaky finger at the person towering over his student. ""That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!"" His voice was filled with a mix of awe and fear, as he gave a sidelong glance to his student.

The young man's heart pounded fiercely in his chest but he stood his ground, now aware of the gravity of the situation. The world champion or not, he was not going to back down without a fight. His mentor's warning words echoed in his head as he walked forward, stepping into the spotlight to face the world champion, prepared to give his all, to fight the greatest battle of his life.",A,"```

88,It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it.,"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between hills, a young boy named Max lived with his parents. He was a clever lad, always curious about the world around him. One day, his best friend, Danny, came to him with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. He suggested they steal apples from Mr. Johnson's orchard, as many other kids had done it before.

Max felt a rush of excitement at the idea, but at the same time, he knew it was wrong. He thought back to the lessons his parents had always taught him about right and wrong. He remembered them telling him, ""It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it."" 

With his parents' words echoing in his mind, Max looked at Danny and shook his head. He explained to Danny that stealing was wrong, no matter how many others were doing it. From that day on, Max always stood up for what was right, teaching his friends along the way about the importance of morality over popularity.","A. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.
B. Your best friend, Lilly, had a bad habit of procrastinating her schoolwork. Today, she texted you excitedly, saying she was heading to the luxury spa downtown instead of dealing with her mounting pile of assignments. You stared at her message, considering the possibility of joining her for a much-needed stress relief session. However, your own stack of homework caught your attention.

You remembered your mom's stern words from before, ""Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too."" You knew she was right, but the idea of ditching your homework for a moment of relaxation tempted you. You found yourself battling internally, a part of you yearning for the spa's tranquility and another part reminding you of your responsibilities.

You decided to reply to Lilly, wishing her a fun spa day and letting her know that you wouldn't be able to make it. As you settled down to your homework, you felt a strange sense of satisfaction, knowing that you were doing what was right for you. And while the spa could offer temporary comfort, finishing your homework would ultimately lead to long-term success and peace of mind.
C. Frank, my old buddy from college, has always been somewhat technophobic. Whenever the topic of computers or technology came up, he would always wave it off, saying it was too daunting for him. He found the idea of delving into the labyrinth of code to create a functioning computer program particularly intimidating. This avoidance of technology was surprising since Frank was always up for challenges in other areas of his life.

Then, something unusual happened the last time we met. Frank surprised everyone by proclaiming that he was finally ready to conquer his fear of technology. He confidently announced that he would attempt to write his first computer program. The proclamation came out of nowhere, catching everyone, including me, off guard.

We had all gotten used to Frank's refusal to dip his toes in the world of technology, so this sudden shift was undoubtedly unexpected. However, it was also encouraging to see him willing to step out of his comfort zone. Frank's decision marked a new chapter in his life, and we were all eager to see how this turn of events would unfold.
D. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.",B,
89,"You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.","As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.","A. John had always been passionate about starting his own business. After years of saving and planning, he finally launched his startup. The first few months were exciting and promising. However, the following year was fraught with unexpected challenges and unforeseen expenses.

He had invested not only his money but also his time and effort, and yet, he had to face the harsh reality of his startup failing. His friends tried to console him, but John was inconsolable. He felt he had lost everything.

One day, his old friend Peter visited him. After listening to John's woes, Peter said, ""I know it's tough, John. But if you look at the bright side, you got to learn so much from the experience. No business school would ever give you the kind of real-life lessons that you learned from running your own business."" Peter's words struck a chord, and John slowly began to see the silver lining. He had indeed gained invaluable insights that would certainly pave the way for his future endeavors.
B. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.
C. Once upon a time, in a small village named Solitude, there was a tradition followed by everyone - keeping a jug full of water near the table at night. This practice was initiated by the village elder, a wise old woman named Nanna, who always advised her villagers to stay hydrated. Nanna believed that water was the essence of life and one must always keep some nearby, particularly during the night when the body needs to rejuvenate.

One balmy summer night, a tired and thirsty traveler named Jack arrived in Solitude. The villagers, following their tradition, offered him a place to sleep, a sumptuous meal, and of course, placed a jug full of cool water near his bed table. Jack, being a city man, found this tradition quaint yet heartwarming.

During the night, Jack woke up feeling incredibly thirsty due to the dry summer air. To his relief, he remembered the jug of water kept near his table. He reached out and took a long, refreshing sip of the cool water which immediately quenched his thirst.

After that night, Jack not only took back fond memories of Solitude and its people but also a valuable lesson from Nanna. He understood the wisdom behind keeping a jug full of water near the table at night, a practice he continued when he returned home. The villagers of Solitude had indeed quenched his thirst in more ways than one.
D. Sophie had always taken pride in her own ideas, often revelging in the praise her original thinking received. She was known for her imagination, her perspectives that wove a different narrative, an unusual point of view. However, one day, she stumbled upon a series of novels that came highly recommended from her mentor. With anticipation, she turned the first page of the book, unaware of how significantly her mindset was about to shift. 

Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book, each page containing a point of view or analysis that clashed with her previous understanding. The characters and the settings were not the only elements that intrigued her, the ideologies and the morals it portrayed made her question her own beliefs. It wasn't a gentle nudge to her psyche but rather a startling shove, compelling her to step back and reconsider what she thought she knew. 

She wrestled with these new notions, her mind constantly consumed by the storm of thoughts. Gradually, as she engaged more with these texts, she realized the importance of constantly challenging one's beliefs. The books opened her up to a realm of understanding and acceptance, and Sophie learned that no idea is absolute, every thought and belief is meant to be questioned and understood deeply.",B,#A
90,Just because your roommate never cleans up after himself doesn't mean you should too.,"Living with a roommate can be challenging, especially when it comes to housekeeping responsibilities. Jeremy found this out the hard way when he moved in with Mark. Just because his roommate, Mark, never cleaned up after himself, didn't mean Jeremy should too. Jeremy was raised with strong values of cleanliness and organisation.

At first, he tried to cope with the mess, hoping Mark would eventually pick up his clothes, wash his dishes, and take out the garbage. But as time went by, Jeremy realized that this change was unlikely to happen. Mark's careless attitude towards cleanliness was beginning to irk him. He decided not to let his roommate's bad habits influence him, he didn't want to lower his standards.

One day, he took it upon himself to discuss the situation with Mark, expressing his feelings about the ongoing mess. After a lengthy discussion, Mark agreed to make more of an effort, promising that their shared space would be more livable, which showed Jeremy that standing up for cleanliness was indeed the right decision.","A. John and I had always been obsessed with mysteries and true crime stories. When we heard about the recent robbery in our quiet neighborhood, we knew we needed to investigate. ""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" I suggested to John. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear from him directly.""

John agreed and we both took the short walk to Mr. Thompson's house, a semi-detached property that had seen better days. Knocking on the door, we were greeted by a man in his sixties, seemingly calm despite his ordeal. He invited us in, offering us a weak smile as he served us cups of lukewarm tea.

We sat in his surprisingly orderly living room, full of anticipation. He began sharing his experience, his voice trembling as he remembered the incident. Each detail was more thrilling than the next - from how he discovered his missing possessions, to his first glimpse of the security footage revealing the burglar's masked face. Though we felt empathy for Mr. Thompson's loss, we couldn't hide our excitement at living a real life mystery. It was indeed much more thrilling hearing it from the victim himself.

D. Larry had been a lifelong fan of the mystery writer, Arthur K. Bennett. The intrigue and suspense in Bennett's novels have kept him awake for countless nights. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the annual 'Mystery Writers Meet,' he had yet to receive an invite. The event was an exclusive gathering of esteemed authors and their ardent fans, and invitations were notoriously hard to come by. 

He had tried for years, writing heartfelt letters to the organizers explaining his love for Bennett's work. Each year, he eagerly awaited a positive response, but it never came. Larry was beginning to lose hope when one day a golden envelope arrived in his mailbox. His heart pounded in his chest as he recognized the official seal of the 'Mystery Writers Meet' stamped on it.

Barely believing his eyes, Larry ripped open the envelope and there it was – a personalized invitation for him to attend the event. The anticipation bubbled in his chest as he realized he would finally have the chance to meet the man whose stories had captured his imagination for so many years.",B,

Larry was a hardworking fellow, always eager to get started and finish his tasks early. It was a trait that most admired about him. However, Larry had a flaw that often counteracted his zeal for efficiency; he would always jump into tasks without reading the requirements. 

On a typical Tuesday morning, Larry was tasked with a new project. Like always, he immediately got to work, not even sparing a glance at the comprehensive list of requirements laid out by the project manager. Larry's coworkers watched him with a mixture of admiration for his enthusiasm and dread, knowing that his haste would inevitably lead to unnecessary complications.

Hours turned into days, and Larry completed his project well ahead of schedule. But as was the norm, it soon became evident that his work was far from perfect. His colleagues grimaced, their predictions having come true. The project, though finished early, had major inconsistencies that they now had to spend their time fixing.

C. I have always been one to admire bold, vibrant colours. Deep reds, cobalt blues and vibrant oranges that make a statement, that catch your eye even from afar. You, on the other hand, decided to get a soft muted beige car, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.

""I don’t really like the colour of your car,"" I remember saying to you one sunny afternoon, as we sat on the porch, sipping on homemade lemonade. I even pointed to your car, parked at the curb, as if you didn't know which one I was referring to.

You laughed, a soft chuckle that had me smirking, before setting down your glass on the table. ""I figured as much,"" you responded, a teasing glint in your eyes. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.""

I had to concede, knowing you had a point. After all, you were always drawn to the softer, subtler things in life, that found beauty in simplicity, and it was one of the many reasons I adored you. So although I may not have agreed with your choice of car colour, I could still appreciate why you chose it. It was, after all, very you.
D. I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.",B,"19th century, and 20th, 21st, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012,"

This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.
B. David was an IT specialist working in a fast-paced tech firm. Lately, he had been falling behind on his workload, his usually impeccable performance dwindling. It had become apparent that David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager. The warnings he had received from his superiors for not meeting his deadlines echoed in his mind, creating a nerve-wracking atmosphere around him.

To make things worse, a crucial project had just been assigned to his team: the setup of a brand new system. This was not just any system but was destined to be the backbone of the company's operations. David knew this was his chance to redeem himself and restore his reputation.

C. Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it. Larry's keen foresight had paid off, leaving him with not just a house, but a treasure trove.
D. Your best friend, Lilly, had a bad habit of procrastinating her schoolwork. Today, she texted you excitedly, saying she was heading to the luxury spa downtown instead of dealing with her mounting pile of assignments. You stared at her message, considering the possibility of joining her for a much-needed stress relief session. However, your own stack of homework caught your attention.

You remembered your mom's stern words from before, ""Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too."" You knew she was right, but the idea of ditching your homework for a moment of relaxation tempted you. You found yourself battling internally, a part of you yearning for the spa's tranquility and another part reminding you of your responsibilities.

You decided to reply to Lilly, wishing her a fun spa day and letting her know that you wouldn't be able to make it. As you settled down to your homework, you felt a strange sense of satisfaction, knowing that you were doing what was right for you. And while the spa could offer temporary comfort, finishing your homework would ultimately lead to long-term success and peace of mind.",D,"19th of September 20221, the 19th of 2022, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202, the 19th of 202"
93,Mary should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer.,"Mary had always admired Rose Donovan, a renowned novelist who had never attended college. She was enthralled by Rose's captivating words and the worlds she conjured in her readers' minds. Thus, when the teenage years brought about their inevitable angst, Mary found herself disillusioned with school.

She thought to herself that if Rose Donovan, her favorite writer, could create such beauty without a college education, then perhaps she too could follow the same path. With this in mind, Mary made a decision that stunned her family. Against their advice and pleas, Mary dropped out of school, intending to immerse herself in the craft of writing.

At first, it was exciting, the freedom and the sense of rebellion invigorating. However, she soon realized that the journey she had embarked on was not as glamorous as she thought. There were countless days and nights of feeling inadequate, of her work feeling subpar. Over time, Mary came to understand that she should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer, as each path to success is different, and some require a harder, longer journey than others.","A. Ever since I can remember, I've yearned for a place to call my own. The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize. 

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

However, I've come to terms with my situation, understanding that this is just a stepping stone towards achieving my dream. I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate.
B. The candle had been burning for hours, casting a warm glow across the room, but now its life was ending. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke. The smoke twirled and danced gracefully in the air, a subtle performance of nature, before slowly beginning to dissipate.

To John, who was quietly sitting across the room, this sequence of events felt oddly symbolic. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life - how something so beautiful and vibrant could just vanish in an instant, leaving behind a mere ghost of its existence. 

His mind traveled back to the year his mother had passed away. A once vivacious woman, her flame had too been dimmed by the cruel hands of cancer, leaving behind only memories - ephemeral wisp of smoke to grasp. 

He leaned back, closing his eyes, allowing himself to dive into the deeper depths of his thoughts, feeling the loss once again. He didn't know how long he sat there, lost in his thoughts, but when he opened his eyes again, the wisp of smoke had completely disappeared. The room was now submerged in darkness, the extinguished candle serving as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life.
C. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.
D. I had always known Miranda to be a crafty girl, but it wasn't until we were paired up for a history project that I saw just how sneaky she could be. The project was to create a detailed timeline on the events of the Revolutionary War, clearly not an easy task. We agreed to share the work equally, to make the workload lighter for both of us. However, I soon noticed Miranda's work ethic didn't quite match mine.

One day, while we were brainstorming in the library, Miranda suggested we divide the tasks. To my surprise, she offered to take over the easy part, compiling the list of dates and events. She then suggested I take up the responsibility of researching each event in depth, crafting detailed descriptions, and designing the physical timeline; the hardest part of the assignment.

Miranda said it so sweetly, with a harmless smile and an innocent tilt of her head. But I immediately saw through her. She was trying to hand over the hardest part of the assignment to me so she doesn't have to do it. Realizing her cunning intentions, I decided to negotiate the division of tasks more fairly, refusing to let her escape her fair share of the work.",C,"s and the other day, and the other, and the other.

94,"It was a fantastic vacation, but all good things come to an end.","The summer of 2016 was unforgettable, as it was filled with a fantastic vacation my family and I had been planning for months. We had decided to embark on a month-long exploration trip across Europe, seeing the sights and soaking in the culture of different countries. The first week was spent roaming the beautiful, love-filled streets of Paris, where we ascended the Eiffel Tower and indulged in scrumptious, traditional French cuisine. 

Our second destination was the historically rich city of Rome, Italy, where we marveled at the grandeur of the Colosseum and indulged in some of the best pizzas and pastas. After Italy, we moved on to Spain, where we enjoyed the lively Flamenco dances and the unique architecture in Barcelona. The magic of these experiences was amplified by the bond my family and I shared, as we created countless memories and grew closer with every passing day. 

As each day passed, our holiday got better, leaving us yearning for more adventures and experiences. Yet, the final week came all too soon, and we found ourselves back home, unpacking our suitcases and hanging up the photos we took. We sighed, missing the vibrancy and excitement that our vacation had brought. It was indeed a fantastic vacation, but as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.","A. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.
B. At the monthly corporate meeting, the management sat across a large polished table, their faces stern and resolute. They had assembled to address the employees about the drastic changes about to take place in the company. The air in the room was fraught with tension as the management finally began to speak. 

""We value your dedication and effort,"" they began, ""but the market scenario is drastically changing and we need to adapt."" Their tone was firm, a clear indication of the seriousness of the situation. They continued, ""To survive, we've outlined some new policies which will require significant adjustment from everyone."" 

The employees glanced at each other, uncertainty etched on their faces. The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go. The words hung heavy in the room; the ultimatum had been delivered with a stark finality. The employees were left to wrestle with the tough choice of either complying with the impending changes or losing their jobs entirely.
C. For the past four years, I have had an exceptional journey at the university, a time characterized by thrilling encounters, rigorous studies, profound self-discovery, and formation of enduring friendships. My journey in college has been more than just an academic pursuit. It was a period of intense personal growth where I learned to celebrate victories, nurse failures, question norms, and seek knowledge beyond the confines of textbooks.

Tomorrow, however, marks a significant milestone in my life as I prepare for my graduation. It is a bittersweet moment as I reminisce on the camaraderie built with my peers during late-night study sessions and the exhilarating cheers from the crowd during inter-college sports events. I fondly recall the deep discussions with my professors that moulded my thoughts, the laughter that echoed through the dorm rooms, and even the stress of meeting assignment deadlines which taught me resilience and time management.

However, as I prepare to bid goodbye to this familiar space, the realization sets in that the journey was not just about reaching the destination, but more importantly, it was about the experiences gathered along the way. As I step out of college, I feel well-equipped to navigate the next chapter of my life with the lessons I have learned, the values I have developed and the dreams I have nurtured within these walls. 

Yes, I have had a fantastic time in college, but as I graduate tomorrow, I am not only walking away with a degree but a wealth of experiences that I will cherish for the rest of my life. With this, I stride toward my future, knowing that my college years have prepared me for the journey ahead, equipped me with strength, and instilled in me a hunger for lifelong learning.
D. Every morning, I have a steadfast routine of strolling into the downtown cafe for my daily fix of caffeine. It's an indulgence I've always allowed myself, rationalizing that it's a small expense for such a big pleasure. A double-shot of espresso to start my day, a late morning latte, an afternoon cappuccino; coffee was my fuel, my lifeline. 

I never really thought about my tiny daily coffee expenses until I began to audit my finances. As a freelance graphic designer, my income was wildly inconsistent, but the expense for my coffee never faltered. When I sat down to pour over my bank statement, I was floored. The daily $5 here and $4 there had accumulated over the month into a sizable portion of my income. 

Staring at the numbers, I felt a knot in my stomach. I realized that my beloved coffee habit was draining up all my income. The decision was difficult, but inevitable; the time had come to invest in a coffee machine at home and drastically cut down on my cafe visits.",C,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
95,"Sachin is said to be the best cricketer in the world, but like every other player, he had to retire.","Sachin Tendulkar, an Indian cricketer, was widely recognized as the best cricketer in the world. His ability to manipulate the cricket ball with his bat, his speed between the wickets, and his defensive techniques have astonished spectators and opponents alike. From the pitches of Mumbai to the renowned cricketing grounds of Lords in England, Sachin's performances had built him a reputation unparalleled in modern cricketing history. 

Every cricket enthusiast, whether from India or not, admired Sachin's artistry and skill. Cricket connoisseurs often say that watching Sachin on the field was like watching poetry in motion. Sachin was not just a player; he was an emotion that united a billion people in India, making them forget their worries and differences every time he walked onto the pitch.

However, like every other player, Sachin also had to face the inevitable twilight of his career. Despite holding numerous records and accolades under his belt, time spares no one. The day of his retirement from cricket was considered a dark day for the sport. Nevertheless, the legend of Sachin still lives on in the hearts of millions, proving that while players retire, their legacy remains forever.","A. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.
B. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, lived a young artist named Alex. He was full of aspirations, with an insatiable desire for success in his artistic endeavors. One day, he got an offer from a renowned gallery to showcase his works. His old and wise mentor, Robert, was ecstatic to hear this news. 

Seeing the glittering greed in Alex's eyes, Robert cautioned, ""Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you."" He emphasized the gravity of his statement by adding, ""If you negotiate too much they might take the offer back."" Alex, blinded by his greed, dismissed Robert's wise advice as the fear of an old man.

However, his relentless negotiation with the gallery didn't go well. The gallery management, unimpressed with his unabashed greed, withdrew their offer. Alex, left with regret and an invaluable lesson, realized the wisdom in Robert's words: modesty sometimes had its rewards.
C. President Jack Bryan had achieved a level of popularity unmatched by any of his predecessors in his term. His policies had lifted the nation from an economic downturn, his charismatic speeches united a previously divided people, and his transparent leadership earned him unwavering trust. The nation adored him, his approval ratings consistently soaring to incredible heights. However, he was also a firm believer in the power and necessity of democratic processes.

Jack Bryan respected the constitution more than anything, viewing it as the backbone of their nation's democratic values. Despite public clamor for him to serve another term, he was adamant about stepping down at the end of his term. The constitution allowed a president to serve only two consecutive terms, and he had already served his.

As the end of his term approached, his retirement speech became a much-anticipated event. He addressed the nation, thanking them for their support, urging them to maintain unity, and encouraging them to respect the constitutional process. He retired with grace and dignity, cementing his legacy as a president who was not only greatly loved but also deeply respected for upholding the constitution. Despite the nation's wish for him to stay on, they held great respect for his firm stand on constitutional adherence.
D. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide.

Ralph has always been a detail-oriented person, but this current project of ours seemed to magnify this trait to an annoying level. We bought this old, dilapidated house on the countryside with the intention of renovating it completely. It was a huge project that required the utmost attention to every room, every nook and cranny. Despite the enormity of the task, his attention was bizarrely drawn to one particular doorknob.

This was not an ordinary doorknob, but an antique, rusted one which was hanging onto the main entrance door of our project house. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture. It confounds me how he can lose himself in the intricacies of the tarnished brass detail while ignoring the bigger tasks at hand. 

Rooms needed painting, floorboards needed replacing, and the roof definitely needed some serious work. Yet here was Ralph, consumed with researching how to restore a singular, century-old doorknob. It was a testament to his tendency to get lost in the minute details and lose sight of the larger goal, a flaw that could potentially derail our entire renovation plan.
B. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.
C. Alex had always been a hardworking individual, constantly engrossed in his projects and meeting tight deadlines. His dedication to work was admirable, but it didn't come without a cost; he often overlooked the need to take a break and relax. So, when his friends planned a trip to Hawaii, they made sure to include him. 

Before leaving, they made him promise one thing, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" They understood that this was going to be a much-needed break for Alex and were determined to keep work out of it. 

Initially, Alex struggled to relax, checking emails and answering calls. His friends intervened, gently nudging him to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the exotic food, and the relaxing beach activities. Gradually, he let go of his workaholic tendencies and began to enjoy the moment. 

By the end of the trip, Alex felt rejuvenated. He finally realized that work could wait, and the importance of taking breaks and enjoying life. He was only gone for a week, but that week taught him a vital lesson about work-life balance that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.

Her excitement matched mine when I first shared the news of my engagement, and naturally, I assumed she would be my maid of honor. But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness.

Once there was a young woman named Amelia, just entering her 20s. She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.
B. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
C. In the bustling corporate office of Dynamic Solutions, Alex was overwhelmed. As a new recruit, he had been taking on as much work as possible to make a good impression. However, his supervisor, Mike, sensed his apprehension and took him aside for a chat. ""Alex,"" Mike said, ""there's no need to take on so much work this quarter.""

Mike's words seemed counterintuitive to Alex, given his ambitious nature. ""Our company policy is a bit different,"" Mike explained, ""the performance this quarter won't significantly impact appraisals. So, don't stretch yourself too thin in your desire to impress.""

Instead, Mike advised Alex to strategically invest more time and effort in the next two quarters. Those were the periods when the management would be actively prioritizing individual contributions. Feeling relieved, Alex thanked his supervisor, promising to heed his advice and manage his workload more strategically in the future.
D. Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.",A,"s and the 30s and the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and the 70s and the 80s and the 90s.

It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart.

David had longed all day for the comforting familiarity of his favorite restaurant, The Cherry Orchard. Work had been particularly challenging, littered with meetings and unforeseen crises, pushing him to the brink of his sanity. The first chance he got, he quickly escaped to his gastronomic haven.

The minute he walked in, he was greeted by the warm lights and the homely smell of freshly cooked meals. As always, he ordered the chef's special - a divine chicken casserole with rustic bread on the side. From the moment the dish was placed in front of him, he could see the steam rising, the sauce gently bubbling, and the bread, golden brown, releasing an inviting aroma.

He started eating with the kind of fervor only seen in a man who has had to survive an exhaustive day without a bite. Each spoonful was savored, every bite was cherished as the delectable flavor danced on his tongue, rejuvenating his exhausted soul. He was so lost in the moment, so enthralled by the food, that time seemed to blur and hasten simultaneously. 

But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal. Looking down at the empty plate, he could only muster a satisfied sigh, his hunger and weariness both vanquished by the hearty dish.
B. You had been holding onto a secret for weeks now, a secret about your mother's favorite vase. It was an antique vase passed down in her family for generations, and you had accidentally knocked it off the table while cleaning. Its pieces were now concealed in your closet, hidden beneath piles of old clothes. Each day that passed made you feel more and more guilty about your deceit. 

Your friend, Mike, had been aware of your dilemma since the day of the accident. He insisted you should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress. He reminded you about how understanding and forgiving your mother usually was. After several days of persuasion, you finally agreed with him. So you picked up the shards of the broken vase and mustered the courage to confess. You were ready to relieve the weight that was hanging heavily on your shoulders for weeks.
C. In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

Veins popped out from his neck as his anger intensified, and his voice echoed like thunder through the silent streets. The crowd around them flinched at his every word, each one sharper and harsher than the last. His rage had controlled him, made him a roaring lion amongst the frightened lambs. But, after spewing out his frustrations, Gerald's storm slowly began to calm. 

He felt a heaviness lift from his chest as he expelled his rage, his mind clearing like the sky after a tempest. After letting off his rage, he sat down like a lamb, his once roaring demeanor replaced with a calm one, realizing that anger was no solution to their problem.
D. John was in the middle of the semester break, with time stretched out before him like an endless highway. The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.",A,2017.09.103.13.08.18.03.15.01.01.1.01.0.1.1.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0.01.0

B. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.
C. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.

Lester had always dreamt of dancing on stage in front of an audience, however, his shy nature often held him back. Finally, after years of practicing and getting motivation from his friends, he decided to give his dream a shot. The local theatre group was holding auditions for their renowned dance team that day, the perfect opportunity for Lester.

Yet, time slipped from Lester's hands as he double-checked every detail. From his costume to the dance steps, he didn't want to leave any room for mistakes. With this meticulous preparation, he was running extremely late and the audition was about to be closed.

Almost out of breath, he reached the venue just in time, by the skin of his teeth. With a quick apology for his tardiness, he took the stage. Performing his well-practiced routine, Lester astounded everyone with his exceptional skills and passion. It was a close call, but, in the end, Lester made the dance team, showing everyone that it is never too late to chase your dreams.
B. Seeing my old friend Mark after so long, I was ecstatic to hear that his child had reached a significant milestone. ""Wow, your kid just graduated middle school!"" I exclaimed, hardly believing how much time had passed since our own school days. 

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.

D. The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage.

B. In the small town of Baker's Crest, people lived simple lives, mostly untouched by the allure of wealth and luxury. The quiet town was buzzing one day with the news of a travelling merchant who claimed to sell ""real gold"" artifacts. The townspeople gathered at the market square, attracted by the glinting objects displayed on his cart. 

The items glittered under the sunlight, their sheen unmatched, making everyone believe they were indeed made of gold. The merchant, a persuasive man, told captivating tales of the artifacts being lost treasures of ancient kings. An air of greed and desire blew over the town, as everyone wanted a piece of this assumed wealth. They traded their hard-earned savings for the glittering items, believing they had struck a fortune. 

It was not until a wise old man from the town examined the artifacts closely and declared them to be mere brass, cleverly polished to resemble gold. All the glitter had indeed fooled them, reinforcing the adage, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The realization dawned, leaving the townspeople embarrassed, having learned their lesson the hard way.
C. Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy. This principle was engraved into his heart by his parents, especially when it came to his professional life. He knew that lying to land a job could possibly offer a temporary success but it certainly was not a sustainable solution.

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.

102,"When the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes. So, devour them.","Throughout the radiant summer months, our humble town was famed for one thing above all - our irresistibly delicious mangoes. Luscious, juicy, and oh-so-sweet, they painted a tropical picture so vivid that it could make anyone forget the relentless summer heat. However, the golden rule everyone lived by was; when the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes.

It was true. As the sweltering sun receded and the cool fall breeze took its place, the mango trees would bid goodbye to their precious bounty. The trees would strip down, bare and empty, bearing no fruit until the next year's summer. So, as the rule goes, devour them while you can. 

Children and adults alike took this message to heart. Backyards were filled with laughter and joy as families huddled together, relishing the sweet and sticky sensation of mangoes. Every bite was an ode to the fleeting summer, a memory to be cherished until the next season, when we would once again have access to such delicious mangoes. The town was united not just by the love for these tropical delights, but also the looming melancholy that came with the changing seasons.","A. In this part of town, hidden away behind the bustling city life, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes. These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.
B. From the moment I walked into the party that night, I felt an odd tension in the air. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, but something felt amiss. I brushed it off, attributing it to the slight anxiety I always had at social events. It was not until I ran into Nick, a dear friend I had known since grade school, that I realized the source of my discomfort.

We engaged in small talk, but the conversation quickly escalated into an argument, right in the middle of the party.

I stood there, shocked and humiliated as Nick unleashed a barrage of personal insults on me, for no apparent reason.

Our shared memories and the deep bond we had forged over the years instantly shattered. I felt a cold, heavy feeling settle in my heart as I walked out of the party, leaving behind a room full of murmurs and confused faces. I vowed then and there, that as much as it pained me, I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.
C. Jake, a friend of mine, had been trapped in the 12th grade for the last five years. His academic journey had been a rollercoaster ride, filled with numerous obstacles and failures. It seemed like the universe was conspiring to prevent Jake from achieving his dream of graduating high school. Every year, he would start the academic term with a fervor, attending classes, participating actively, and submitting all his assignments on time. 

However, as the school year wore on, he would lose his momentum, often finding himself unable to keep up with his classmates. This became a recurring pattern, earning him the dubious honor of being the oldest student in our grade. His spirit was dampened, but his determination to pass was unwavering. He enlisted tutors, spent countless hours studying and sought advice from previous graduates.

Finally, in his sixth attempt, the persistent efforts of Jake bore fruit. With a weary yet triumphant smile, Jake held up his high school diploma, finally succeeding to pass the 12th grade, proof that persistence and dedication can overcome even the toughest of hurdles.
D. Living in the small northern town of Kjørnes, Norway, the residents understood the value of sunlight more than anyone else. It's a stark difference between the sunny days of summer and the fleeting daylight of the harsh winter. Hence, they were always thankful for the sunshine that graced their town during the brief but beautiful summer. The phrase, ""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter,"" echoed in every gathering, reminding everyone to soak in as much sun as they possibly could.

This summer was no exception. As the sun rose in the bright blue sky, children would rush out of their homes to play, their laughter ringing through the peaceful town. The adults spent their time gardening, enjoying the feeling of warmth on their skin. Barbecues, picnics, and sunbathing became the town's pastime, bringing a vibrant energy that only came with the summer sunshine.

However, as the days began to shorten, a sense of urgency hung in the air. They knew that they needed to cherish every sunbeam, every light-filled day, as they would soon retreat to a world of ice and darkness. Regardless, they remained resilient, embracing the inevitable winter, while always looking forward to the next summer’s sunshine.",D,#1234567891011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
103,Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes.,"Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.","A. My heart skips a beat every time I imagine myself skydiving. The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. Once there was a young woman named Amelia, just entering her 20s. She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.
C. John was always one to take risks. His adrenaline-pumping adventures ranged from skydiving to deep-sea diving. Yet, the most thrilling adventure for him was the stock market. The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket."" John took the advice to heart, and rather than rushing into one venture, he wisely decided to spread his investments, realizing the importance of not betting everything on a single possibility.
D. She was the talk of the town, spinning outrageous stories about everyone, giving them enough reasons to loathe her presence. She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.",B,"s and the other day.

104,Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week.,"Alex had always been a hardworking individual, constantly engrossed in his projects and meeting tight deadlines. His dedication to work was admirable, but it didn't come without a cost; he often overlooked the need to take a break and relax. So, when his friends planned a trip to Hawaii, they made sure to include him. 

Before leaving, they made him promise one thing, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" They understood that this was going to be a much-needed break for Alex and were determined to keep work out of it. 

Initially, Alex struggled to relax, checking emails and answering calls. His friends intervened, gently nudging him to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the exotic food, and the relaxing beach activities. Gradually, he let go of his workaholic tendencies and began to enjoy the moment. 

By the end of the trip, Alex felt rejuvenated. He finally realized that work could wait, and the importance of taking breaks and enjoying life. He was only gone for a week, but that week taught him a vital lesson about work-life balance that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.","A. For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.
B. President Jack Bryan had achieved a level of popularity unmatched by any of his predecessors in his term. His policies had lifted the nation from an economic downturn, his charismatic speeches united a previously divided people, and his transparent leadership earned him unwavering trust. The nation adored him, his approval ratings consistently soaring to incredible heights. However, he was also a firm believer in the power and necessity of democratic processes.

Jack Bryan respected the constitution more than anything, viewing it as the backbone of their nation's democratic values. Despite public clamor for him to serve another term, he was adamant about stepping down at the end of his term. The constitution allowed a president to serve only two consecutive terms, and he had already served his.

As the end of his term approached, his retirement speech became a much-anticipated event. He addressed the nation, thanking them for their support, urging them to maintain unity, and encouraging them to respect the constitutional process. He retired with grace and dignity, cementing his legacy as a president who was not only greatly loved but also deeply respected for upholding the constitution. Despite the nation's wish for him to stay on, they held great respect for his firm stand on constitutional adherence.
C. In the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, Dan Murphy, a renowned music producer, was hard at work in his state-of-the-art recording studio. Amid the collection of records, tracks, and albums strewn about his desk, one particular task was causing him more distress than any other. It involved his least favorite client, a pompous pop star named Jimmy Sparkle who had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way.

Dan sifted through his vast collection of yet-to-be-released songs, attempting to find one suitable for his demanding client. He chuckled cynically, deciding to choose a tune that wasn't well-received in initial listening sessions. It was a less liked song, one that was penned for an indie artist but somehow didn't make the cut. He remembered the honest lyrics and quirky melody that was met with mixed responses - not all songs can please everyone, he thought.

Feeling a twisted satisfaction, Dan selected the track for Jimmy, the epitome of mainstream pop, a stark contrast to the spirit of the song. He burned the track onto a CD, the words 'New Single - Jimmy Sparkle' etched into it, then packed it away to send to the insufferable pop star. Perhaps, he thought, this could be an awakening for Jimmy, an opportunity for him to make something meaningful instead of his usual cookie-cutter pop. Or perhaps, it would be a disastrous mismatch that would humble him, either way, Dan felt it was a win-win situation for himself.
D. Mary was a visual learner. Ever since her early days in school, she always found it easier to understand concepts that were depicted visually. It didn't matter if it was a complex math problem or a biological cycle, diagrams always spoke to her more clearly than words ever could. 

This unique trait of hers didn't change even when she embarked on her journey as a mechanical engineer. In fact, it became even more pronounced. She would often find herself in her lab, surrounded by textbooks with lengthy paragraphs describing various mechanical processes. 

But she hardly paid any attention to those words. Instead, her eyes would always drift towards the diagrams that represented the processes. They gave her a better and more complete idea of what was going on. For Mary, diagrams were not just illustrations, but a powerful medium that enabled her to grasp and master the intricacies of mechanical engineering. 

Her peers often ridiculed her and called her 'diagram-obsessed.' But she didn't mind. She knew her strengths and preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them. After all, it was this unique learning style of hers that helped her stand out and excel in her field.",B,", the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"

John had always been a cautious man, particularly when it came to his investments. He had a substantial number of shares in a major tech company, shares that he'd held onto for several years. Recently, though, the market had taken a downturn and the value of his shares had plummeted. Panicked, he was on the verge of making a hasty decision to sell all his shares to avoid further losses.

His friend, Robert, who was a seasoned investor, told him, ""You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap."" John paused, considering the wisdom in Robert's words. Rushing to sell could prevent more potential losses, but it could also rob him of future profits if the shares rebounded. 

""Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound,"" Robert continued. John realized he needed to be patient, to watch the market closely before making any rash decisions. After all, impulsive actions could lead to regret, especially in matters as crucial as financial investments.
B. John and I have been best friends since childhood, growing up in the same neighbourhood with a shared obsession for football. We supported different teams; he was always a diehard fan of England, and I passionately supported Argentina. Every four years, the World Cup gave rise to friendly rivalry between us. Our time would be spent poking fun at the players of each other's team and predicting the loss of the other.

This year, however, the World Cup had taken a different turn. Both England and Argentina were knocked out in the quarter-finals. We stared at the television screen in shared disappointment and disbelief. Silence fell between us as we came to terms with the defeat of our respective teams.

After a few moments of shared mourning, I turned to John and shrugged. ""Since both of our favourite teams have lost, let's enjoy the world cup together and not fight,"" I suggested. Despite our loss, we still had the excitement of the game to share. The World Cup was, after all, bigger than our individual favourites. John nodded, and we settled down, deciding to enjoy the rest of the tournament together without any rivalry.
C. The local soccer match had been in progress for the better part of two hours and had been a thrilling spectacle from the get-go. The two teams, evenly matched, were engaged in a fierce duel for supremacy. Both had managed to net two goals each, creating an electric atmosphere in the stadium. The roaring crowd was on edge, waiting for the decisive moment that would tilt the balance.

Then, in the 87th minute, it happened. The home team's star forward, known for his swift agility and strategic dribbling, outpaced his rivals and ran toward the opponent's goal post. The opposition's goalkeeper was alert, eyes trained on every movement of the forward.

Despite his best efforts, the forward managed to artfully maneuver the ball around him, driving it toward the far post. The moment froze as everyone watched the ball soar through the air and nestle into the net. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal, causing an eruption of euphoria among the home team's supporters.
D. David had longed all day for the comforting familiarity of his favorite restaurant, The Cherry Orchard. Work had been particularly challenging, littered with meetings and unforeseen crises, pushing him to the brink of his sanity. The first chance he got, he quickly escaped to his gastronomic haven.

The minute he walked in, he was greeted by the warm lights and the homely smell of freshly cooked meals. As always, he ordered the chef's special - a divine chicken casserole with rustic bread on the side. From the moment the dish was placed in front of him, he could see the steam rising, the sauce gently bubbling, and the bread, golden brown, releasing an inviting aroma.

He started eating with the kind of fervor only seen in a man who has had to survive an exhaustive day without a bite. Each spoonful was savored, every bite was cherished as the delectable flavor danced on his tongue, rejuvenating his exhausted soul. He was so lost in the moment, so enthralled by the food, that time seemed to blur and hasten simultaneously. 

But before he knew it, he had already finished the delicious meal. Looking down at the empty plate, he could only muster a satisfied sigh, his hunger and weariness both vanquished by the hearty dish.",D,"s and the other day.

106,"My daughter creates problems for my mom in the afternoon if she has nothing else to do. After all, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.","My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.","A. The much-anticipated Friday afternoon had finally arrived, and to my pleasant surprise, I had no homework assigned for the weekend. I could feel a strange sense of freedom as I stepped off the school bus and took the familiar path to our house. Suddenly, the thought of having nothing to do turned into an exciting idea - I decided I'd devote the whole weekend to annoying my older brother, Jacob. Jacob was the typical older sibling, always bossy and never missing a chance to tease me.

I began crafting a meticulous plan, fueled by previous unsuccessful attempts to get back at him. My mind began to bubble with ideas - switching his toothpaste with mayonnaise, short-sheeting his bed, pretending to sneak up on him with a plastic spider. I carefully spent the entire Saturday preparing everything, secretly grinning to myself.

Sunday morning arrived, and I was all set to implement my genius plan. First, I woke up early and switched his toothpaste, trying my best to suppress my laughter as I imagined his reaction. As the day progressed, I was enjoying each of his bewildered reactions. By the end of the weekend, I had successfully pulled off all my tricks and enjoyed an entire weekend of hilarity at my brother's expense.
B. The meeting room was filled with an ominous silence as George, the technical lead, addressed his team. ""In order to meet the project deadlines,"" he began, ""it is paramount that everyone follows my strategies and ideas without hesitation or disagreement."" The tension in the room escalated as he continued, reminding them of the looming deadline and the mounting stakes of their project. 

His team shared exchanged uneasy glances. Was it out of fear? Frustration? They were, after all, a group of skilled, professional individuals, each with their unique ideas and perspectives that have propelled previous projects to success. 

Sarah, the newest member, couldn't help but question whether this authoritarian approach was the best way to achieve their goals. But, she swallowed her doubts, not wanting to upset the team dynamics just yet. They all nodded in agreement, signalling their acceptance of George's directive. 

To succeed, they would now have to abide by his strict rules, willingly silencing their own thoughts. The future of the project hinged on their collective obedience and the effectiveness of George's plans. Failure was not an option, but at what cost?
C. Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.
D. As an engineering student, I had gotten used to unexpected challenges and pressure. Yet, I was not prepared for what happened during our final semester. My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.",A,

John was in the middle of the semester break, with time stretched out before him like an endless highway. The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.
B. Dr. Stevenson, a renowned neurosurgeon, had an important surgery scheduled the next day, a complex brain procedure that required his full concentration and skill. Aware of the gravity of the operation, he decided to dedicate the entire day before to preparing both mentally and physically. In order to do this, he needed an environment free from any distractions, no matter how insignificant they might seem.

He called a brief meeting with his staff, comprised of dedicated nurses, young eager interns, and experienced assistants. The doctor explained the nature of the surgery, a meticulous procedure that could significantly change his patient's life. He expressed his need for quiet and uninterrupted focus for his preparation.

""Tomorrow's operation is a challenging one,"" Dr. Stevenson told his team, his voice steady and commanding respect. ""I would like to ask you not to interrupt me with any minor tasks today, unless it is a critical issue."" 

The staff listened intently and understood the seriousness of his request. They promised to uphold their roles efficiently so the doctor could fully concentrate on the impending procedure. Dr. Stevenson nodded, pleased with his team's commitment, and retired to his office to start his comprehensive preparation for the critical surgery.
C. Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.
D. Every day when she woke up, Jennifer looked through her window and admired her neighbor's home. She thought it was more attractive than her own whenever she turned to look at it. It was a resplendent Victorian mansion with an abundance of gables, a porch that wrapped around the entire front, and immaculate, manicured hedges that lined the driveway. There were vibrantly colored flowers placed expertly throughout the garden, and the white picket fence added an element of charm that she felt her own home lacked.

Jennifer's house, a modest bungalow, was far from unappealing, but paled in comparison to her neighbor's palatial abode. She spent countless hours fussing over her humble garden and undertaking DIY projects to make her home look more like the one across the street. Yet her efforts seemed to fall short every time.

One day, Jennifer struck up a conversation with her neighbor, Ms. Hawthorne. The older woman shared that the upkeep of her lavish home was quite demanding, requiring daily maintenance, considerable expenditure, and constant attention to detail. In that moment, Jennifer realized that while the neighbor's home may have been more attractive, it was certainly more difficult to keep up. She learned to appreciate her own home's charm, realizing its lower maintenance was a blessing in disguise.",A,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
108,"After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired.","Kate had always been a hardworking and dedicated employee, until one day, she was unjustly fired from her job. The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively. She started looking for a new job, determined to move on from the past and prove her worth elsewhere.","A. In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.
B. Ron had always been the free spirit in his family, having no major responsibilities or commitments to worry about. Unlike his older siblings, who were all burdened with jobs, education, and family commitments, Ron's lifestyle seemed to be worry-free. His family and friends saw him as an amusing diversion from their own responsibilities, and his lack of any real obligations became a sort of running joke. 

Amid the laughter and banter, Ron realized that he was relegated to the role of the family clown, making others laugh but never given the chance to prove himself otherwise. He felt that his capability to handle complex situations was overlooked, unappreciated even. Thus, he decided to prove his ability in a rather unconventional manner - pranks.

Ron began devising detailed and complex pranks that required a lot of planning and execution. He wanted these pranks to reflect his creativity and strategic thinking, a demonstration of his potential if given actual responsibilities. Each prank, meticulously planned, and well-executed, started to earn him notoriety amongst his friends and family.

Eventually, people began to notice the complexity and detail behind his pranks, starting to appreciate the potential Ron was aiming to showcase. Through his unconventional approach, Ron had managed to turn his lack of responsibilities into a platform to illustrate his capabilities in managing complex tasks.
C. John had always had a habit of arguing on the silliest topics. From the best way to fold socks to the correct angle to cut a sandwich, he always had a contrary opinion. It was as if he simply could not resist engaging in trivial disputes, the pettier the better. One day, his colleagues decided to test just how dedicated he was to his habit, so they began a debate over the color of the paperclips they used in the office.

John immediately entered into a fierce argument, insisting that red paperclips were superior in every way. His colleagues watched in bemusement as he railed on about the psychology of color and how red represented power and determination. Meanwhile, an important deadline was looming and work was piling up around them. They tried to refocus John's attention on the mounting tasks but to no avail. 

It was like he couldn't see the wood for the trees. In his fixation with arguing over insignificant matters, John was losing sight of the bigger picture and the real issues that needed his attention.
D. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",B,"```

Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
B. Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.
C. James had been smoking for the last fifteen years, ever since he was a young, rebellious teenager. He tried numerous times to quit smoking, but each attempt ended with him lighting another cigarette. But this time was different; James was determined. The process of quitting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking, and James's desire was stronger than ever before.

One day, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and felt a deep distaste for the man he had become; his teeth were yellowing, his breath was constantly foul and his skin was aging prematurely. He saw himself slowly succumbing to the harmful effects of the cigarettes he was so addicted to. It was then he knew he had to make a change. He didn't want his life to be controlled by an addiction anymore.

James tossed his pack of cigarettes in the trash and promised himself that it would be his last. It was the first day of a tough journey, filled with withdrawal symptoms and endless cravings, but James was ready. The desire to quit was his driving force, and he was convinced that he would succeed this time. He had started the process and was ready to see it through to the end.
D. John was in the middle of the semester break, with time stretched out before him like an endless highway. The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.",D,#C

Elizabeth had been a dedicated employee of Wilmont & Co. for two long years. She had joined the company as a fresh-faced graduate, ready to conquer the corporate world with her innovative ideas and infectious enthusiasm. Initially, she loved the challenges her job as a financial analyst presented, enjoyed the camarity with her colleagues, and thrived on the intensity of her work.

However, as time passed, the novelty wore off and the pressures started to mount. Projects began to pile up, deadlines became tighter, and the lines between her personal and professional lives blurred. Elizabeth found herself pouring over financial reports at midnight, attending virtual meetings during her breakfast time, and responding to business emails on weekends. She was always on call, always available, always working.

After enduring this relentless grind for two years, Elizabeth felt a profound exhaustion that no amount of sleep could mend. The once passionate and driven professional, was now just a burned-out shell of her former self. She looked at the company emblem on her screen one day, and realized that she was worn out to the core, understanding that it wasn't just her job she was tired of but her entire life within the company.
B. John had always been one to hustle. It was the way he approached everything in life, from his morning routine to his homework. His mentality was that the faster he got things done, the more time he had for other activities.

One day, his professor handed out a particularly challenging assignment. John, as usual, rushed through it, hoping to beat everyone else in submission. Hours later, he proudly handed in his paper, confident he was the first to finish.

The next week, he received his grade and was stunned to find he had a failing mark. He approached the professor who explained, ""You have made multiple glaring errors due to your hurry."" The teacher further said, ""Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.""

It was a life-altering lesson for John who realized that sometimes slowing down and dedicating time and effort can make all the difference.
C. Derek, the seasoned poker player, stared intently at the hand he was dealt. His cool, calm, collected exterior masked the thrill rushing through his veins. After hours of mediocre hands, this was the one he'd been waiting for - a straight flush in spades. The corners of his lips tilted upwards in a barely visible smile. 

Across the table, his opponents, a tough group of poker regulars, continued their tactical bluffing, unaware of Derek's excitement. He matched their bets without hesitation, his confident eyes never wavering. Round after round, he kept calling, his pile of chips dwindling steadily. 

Finally, the last round arrived and with a deep breath, Derek pushed his remaining chips into the center. He had staked all his money, leaving his fate at the mercy of the cards. The room held its breath, waiting for the reveal, intrigued to see whether Derek's confidence was well-founded or misplaced.

The students, realizing they were momentarily unsupervised, started acting out. What began as innocent fun quickly escalated into chaos. The normally disciplined class turned into a playground. Papers were thrown across the room like snowballs, markers and pencils became dart missiles and textbooks were used as makeshift footballs. 

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede.

B. Jeremy had known Rick for years, ever since they were young boys playing football on the neighborhood streets. Their friendship had always been rocky, filled with competitive banter and rivalry. Over time, Jeremy realized Rick's friendship wasn't as genuine as it seemed. Rick was more inclined towards the glitz of wealth and constantly pursued money. He was the kind of person who'd turn his back on his friends if it meant getting a bigger piece of the pie. 

Despite this, Jeremy didn't cut ties with Rick. He was aware that Rick's intentions were shallow and centered around his own self-interest. Nonetheless, Jeremy decided to continue his friendship with Rick, albeit with more caution and less trust. He figured he could manage to get along with him for the time being, at least until the dynamics of their relationship changed. It was a harsh reality to accept but Jeremy found comfort in the knowledge that he understood Rick's motives and could navigate their relationship accordingly.
C. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.
D. Samantha had always been a frugal young woman. The amount she had in her savings account was the result of years of careful spending and diligent saving. It was a security blanket, a nest egg for future endeavors, and possibly emergencies. And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue. She figured it was better to wait a few months when the rush of holiday travelers would die down, and prices would drop. By then, she would still have a substantial amount left in her savings after purchasing a ticket, and could even have extra money for her trip. In this way, Samantha was ensuring that she would not only have a memorable trip but also a financially secure future.",A,"s of the day.

112,"Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage. A stitch in time saves nine.","John had always been the type to ignore minor problems, allowing them to fester until they became significant issues. One morning, he noticed his car making an odd, grumbling noise. It was a small thing, but a clear sign of something potentially amiss under the hood. ""Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage,"" his wife, Martha, had admonished him countless times. 

But John, ever the procrastinator, chose to put it off. He was busy with work, and besides, the car seemed to be running fine. His mother's old adage echoed in his ears, ""A stitch in time saves nine,"" but he brushed it off, thinking it could wait.

Three days later, the grumbling noise became a horrendous clanging and the engine gave out halfway to work. John ended up stranded in the middle of a busy highway during peak rush hour. He then had to arrange for a tow, miss an important meeting, and pay a heavy repair bill, all of which could have been avoided if he’d listened to his wife and mother. So, he learned the hard way, ignoring the problem only made it worse.","A. David was an IT specialist working in a fast-paced tech firm. Lately, he had been falling behind on his workload, his usually impeccable performance dwindling. It had become apparent that David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager. The warnings he had received from his superiors for not meeting his deadlines echoed in his mind, creating a nerve-wracking atmosphere around him.

To make things worse, a crucial project had just been assigned to his team: the setup of a brand new system. This was not just any system but was destined to be the backbone of the company's operations. David knew this was his chance to redeem himself and restore his reputation.

With a sense of urgency and determination, David scrambled to start the project. He dived into the coding and configuration process with unprecedented intensity, working late nights to ensure the system's successful implementation. His colleagues watched in awe as David, driven by the urgency of his situation, worked tirelessly to setup the new system from scratch.

By the end of the month, the new system was not only up and running, but it was also surpassing everyone's expectations. David's hard work and devotion had saved his reputation, proving that he was, indeed, an invaluable asset to his team and the company.
B. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
C. Nestled in the heart of the city was an exquisite Michelin-star restaurant, Le Gourmet, which had developed a reputation for attracting a surprisingly homogeneous clientele. Every evening, the restaurant would be thrumming with an assortment of well-heeled individuals, all seemingly cut from the same cloth. The patrons were so strikingly similar, it was like the restaurant had a dress code and an age restriction.

The majority of them would arrive adorned in the latest designer attire, reflecting their devotion to fashion. The women dripped with pearls and diamonds and the men donned bespoke suits, with signature timepieces ticking away at their wrists. The guests all appeared to be in their late 40s to early 50s, a sea of silver and salt-and-pepper head, exuding an air of sophistication and success.

Curious onlookers would often watch them from a distance, marveling at their uniformity, and speculating about the demographic the restaurant seemed to draw. Conversations on the sidewalk would be peppered with wild theories - ""Perhaps it's a secret society,"" a passerby would joke. Regardless of the reason, the distinctive clientele added a layer of intrigue and elegance to the restaurant's already esteemed reputation.

In the world of gastronomy, where uniqueness is the gold standard, it was ironic that Le Gourmet's patrons appeared remarkably alike. The fancy Michelin-star restaurant, in its unspoken uniformity, created its own brand of exclusivity, making it even more alluring to those who aspired to be part of its elusive circle.
D. As college students, we are always excited and anxious about the beginning of a new semester. The process of course registration is the first step to entering this new phase of our academic journey. Each semester, we are given the liberty to choose our courses and customize our learning experience. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. 

One major challenge we face during this time is getting a seat in the course we wish to register for. Some courses are extremely popular and have limited seats available. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.

113,I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.,"Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.","A. As the team leader for an advertising agency, I had always valued the contribution of each member. Hence, when one of my subordinates, Mike, came to me requesting early vacation, I was initially tempted to agree. Mike had always been hardworking and it seemed fair to let him have his break. However, there was one issue. Mike had not yet presented his work on our current project for review.

I looked at him, sighed deeply, and said, ""I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation."" His face fell as he realized the impending delay in his plans. 

I explained to him that we needed his report to move forward with the project and that his break could be detrimental to our progress. Mike understood, nodded, and agreed to work on his presentation immediately. While I wished I could have granted his request immediately, I knew the hard truth of our profession: our work had to come first before personal pursuits.
B. Emily and John had been business partners for years and they always worked things out smoothly. But, this time it was different. It was about a business proposal that needed immediate attention and a crucial decision. John, out of over-confidence or ignorance, didn't discuss the problem with Emily right then and there.

Emily got the news the next day when the proposal fell apart. She was furious. ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" she lamented to John, her voice echoing throughout their office. She tried to keep her emotions under control, but it was difficult. ""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" she added, her eyes filled with a rare frustration.

John, understanding his lapse, felt guilt welling up inside him. He didn't want the partnership, built over mutual trust and understanding, to suffer due to his momentary lapse of judgment. He realized the need for immediate action to correct this error. In the silence of their office, he vowed to make things right, no matter how much effort it demanded from him. He hoped his efforts could preserve their relationship and rectify the problem he had caused in their business partnership.
C. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
D. Jake might look confused all the time, his eyebrows perpetually furrowed, his gaze constantly lost somewhere far beyond the present. Strangers would often mistake his seemingly baffled demeanor for a lack of intelligence. His classmates would snicker at his puzzled expressions and even his teachers often underestimated his capabilities. 

But the truth was far from their assumptions. Jake was extraordinarily smart. His mind was ceaselessly engaged, always a few steps ahead of his surroundings. His befuddled expressions were not due to a lack of understanding, but rather, they were the result of his brain processing multiple layers of complexities that others simply couldn't perceive.

No equation was too hard, no riddle too intricate, no book too profound for Jake. His intelligence was not just evident in his academic brilliance, but in the way he could make sense of the world around him, deconstructing and analysing realities that others accepted without thought. In truth, Jake was not perpetually confused, he was perpetually deep in thought, lost in a world of intellectual exploration.",B,"s 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.

114,Resolving small issues in relationships immediately may prevent bigger troubles down the road.,"John and Sarah had been married for five years. The initial honeymoon phase faded away, and they started noticing each other's flaws and quirks. Small issues like not putting the toilet seat down or forgetting to pick up groceries on the way home, which used to go unnoticed, were now turning into a cause of frequent squabbles.

One day, their mutual friend Mike noticed the tension between them. He advised them to address and resolve these small issues before they grow into bigger problems. Mike reminded them of the love they shared and suggested focusing on open communication to understand each other's perspective.

Taking Mike's advice to heart, John and Sarah started resolving each small issue immediately instead of letting it fester. They openly discussed their expectations, frustrations, and found ways to compromise. Over time, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their relationship. This made them realize that resolving small issues immediately indeed prevented bigger troubles down the road.","A. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
B. Leonard Vincent, an ambitious and tenacious director, had finally completed his most personal film to date. The journey had been long, fraught with a myriad of challenges and setbacks that seemed to conspire against the film's completion. A series of unfortunate events from delayed schedules, increasingly demanding actors, to a catastrophic storm, disrupting the sets. Yet, Leonard showed unyielding determination, devoting every ounce of energy he had in his pursuit.

He poured all resources into the film, driven by the conviction of his creative vision. He believed that this film, this raw, unfettered expression of his soul, had the potential to shift perspectives and change lives. His investment didn't just confine to financial; he put his time, sweat, and heart into it, doing everything within his power to get the film released.

However, the immense expenditure led to an unexpected consequence, driving his production company to the brink of bankruptcy. Leonard had recklessly gambled everything, from his reputation to his financial stability, on a single film. Now with the film completed, he could only hope that his sacrifice would not be in vain, that the film would resonate with the audiences, redeeming his company from the precipice of financial ruin.
C. The bell rang for the next class but there was no teacher in sight. The students, realizing they were momentarily unsupervised, started acting out. What began as innocent fun quickly escalated into chaos. The normally disciplined class turned into a playground. Papers were thrown across the room like snowballs, markers and pencils became dart missiles and textbooks were used as makeshift footballs. 

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede. The noise reached its crescendo, until suddenly, the door flung open. A shocked silence fell upon the room as the late-arriving teacher stepped in, taking in the spectacle. The students, knowing they were in trouble, quickly scrambled to fix the mess they had created in the class.
D. Every year, the boutique downtown hosts a spectacular sale. They drop the prices on all their luxury items, making it an event fashion enthusiasts in town don't dare to miss. Over the years, I've learned one important lesson: We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. 

The early bird catches the worm, as they say. The boutique opens at 8 am sharp on the sale day, but the line begins to form as early as 5 am. The most dedicated shopaholics even camp out overnight, trying to secure their place at the front of the line. They make the chilly dawn more than worth it with their triumphant smiles when they emerge from the boutique, their arms full of bags and their hearts full of satisfaction. 

If we want to take part in this fashion frenzy, then we need to plan. It isn't just about getting there early, it's about knowing what we want, grabbing it quickly, and getting it before someone else does. So let's get our coffee brewing at 4 am, brave the morning chill, and join the hustle of the boutique sale. This way, we won't just witness the event, we'll be victors of the fashion battlefield.",D,s and the 2016th of the 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 20188 20188 201888 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 201 there1 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 2011 201 2011 201 201 2011 2011 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201
115,"If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.","John had been working as a software engineer for nearly a decade and developed a knack for understanding and fixing technical glitches. Because of his expertise, friends often approached him with their tech problems. One day, his friend, Lisa, approached him with a desperate expression on her face. Her laptop, which contained all her work and personal data, was refusing to boot up.

""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" John told her regretfully, ""it would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" He explained that the problem was a corrupt operating system. If it had been caught early on, he could have potentially restored the system or saved her data. However, the damage was now too extensive, and the system irreparable.

""But now, you may need to buy a new one,"" he suggested, noting her shocked expression. Although it was unfortunate news, John hoped that next time, Lisa would seek help immediately upon noticing an issue to avoid such a disastrous situation.","A. Lena had always been a diligent employee, focusing on her work and maintaining an immaculate track record. However, things changed when she unexpectedly stumbled upon her boss's hidden affairs. From shady business deals to tax evasions, her boss was involved in all sorts of illegal activities that threatened to bring down the reputation of the entire company.

At first, Lena thought about confronting him. Yet she knew well enough that he would dismiss her instantly, putting her and her family in financial hardship. Therefore, she decided to play it cool, pretending like she knew nothing, all the while gathering evidence to back her up.

The boss, on the other hand, remained oblivious to her newfound knowledge. He continued conducting his shady business, confident that no one could touch him. However, Lena became his hidden threat, silently looming over his head. She cannot be dismissed because she is aware of his shady business dealings and is ready to blow the whistle when the time is right.
B. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
C. Joanna had always been a planner. So, when she decided to visit the city museum, she spent the evening strategizing the perfect timing. She knew that most of the museum visitors arrived between six and eight in the morning. The thought of having to negotiate her way through a crowd did not appeal to her.

Looking online, she found a blog suggesting that the ideal time to visit the museum was one hour before the peak hours. It wasn't just about beating the crowd, but also the opportunity to enjoy the exhibits in quiet reflection. Hence, she decided to arrive at the museum at five, an hour earlier than most visitors.

The next morning, she got ready and reached the museum at five sharp. As she stepped into the empty corridors of the museum, she was delighted. She had the entire place to herself, able to take her time and truly appreciate the exhibits. Joanna smiled, knowing her plan had worked out perfectly.
D. Once upon a time, there was a woman named Sara who worked tirelessly in a corporate cubicle day in and day out. She had been in the same position for a decade and the monotonous routine of her job had begun to wear her down. Each day was an exact replica of the previous one with the same old meetings, deadlines, and reports. She felt bored and tired, slowly losing her enthusiasm and zest.

One gloomy Monday, she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen, her heart filling with despair. It was then that she decided she couldn't do it anymore. Sara decided to break free from the chains of her dull job and pursue her passion for cooking. She saved her money and quit her job, leaving the corporate world behind.

She pooled all her resources and took a leap of faith to open up her own restaurant. With love, she chose every detail, from the menu to the decor. Finally, in her own bustling restaurant, she found her happiness and sense of fulfillment she had been longing for.",C,"Protest' .

116,You should have gone to the doctor earlier. They still could have cured you then.,"I had been telling you for weeks, constantly pestering you to go see a doctor. But you were stubborn, choosing to ignore the persistent cough that seemed to grow worse with each passing day. I hated how you always pushed away concerns about your health, your dismissive attitude was infuriating. You continued to tell me it was nothing more than a seasonal cold, that it would pass.

One day, we woke up to the alarming sound of you gasping for breath, unable to stand on your own. We rushed to the hospital where the doctors hooked you to machines. The sterile smell of the hospital, the muffled sounds of patients and the constant beep of monitors filled the air. 

A grim looking doctor entered the room, removing his spectacles as he prepared to deliver the news. He looked at you and said, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier."" His voice carried a tone of regret and guilt, ""They still could have cured you then."" Your stubbornness had let a simple cold progress into pneumonia that was now threatening your life.","A.

B. Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.
C. Margaret had recently graduated with a degree in mathematics, full of knowledge and enthusiasm to share her love for numbers and equations. But when she was offered her first job as a math teacher at a local high school, the realization struck her; to teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer like herself.

Despite the initial nerves, Margaret knew she had to face her fears. She believed in her abilities, but there was a gap between understanding concepts personally and successfully imparting that knowledge onto others. The task required more than just proficiency in her subject. It needed a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well, she realized.

She started preparing with great earnest, rehearsing her lessons multiple times and preparing examples to better explain the more challenging concepts. She constantly read up on new teaching techniques, worked on her communication skills, and tried to anticipate the questions her students might have.

When the big day finally arrived, Margaret was armed with thorough preparation and a heightened sense of responsibility. As she faced her first class, she took a deep breath and started, ""Good morning, everyone. Today we will embark on an exciting journey of numbers and equations."" That day, she took her first step to becoming not just a teacher, but an effective communicator and motivator for her students.
D. Lily was the kind of person who was always running around trying to help others. She had an exceptional kind heart, always lending a hand, lending an ear, and giving out pieces of her heart to those in need. Her friends, family, and even sometimes strangers benefited from her tireless dedication to making people's lives better. However, Lily often neglected her own needs. 

One day, her close friend, Maria, noticed the tiredness in Lily's eyes. She was a shadow of her bubbly self, a clear indication she was drained. Maria gently reminded her, ""Lily, you can't pour from an empty cup."" 

Lily looked puzzled, so Maria explained, ""You give so much of yourself, but you can't forget to replenish your own energy."" Maria reminded Lily about the importance of self-care, of setting boundaries and ensuring her own cup was filled before she attempted to fill others. It was a lesson Lily took to heart, finally understanding that she couldn't effectively help others if she herself was running on empty.",A,

Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.
B. As the sun began to peek over the horizon, I turned to my wife and declared, ""To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable."" She agreed, as she too craved the freshest, ripest fruits and vegetables for our kitchen. We prepared swiftly, eager to encounter the magic that the early morning market held.

Upon reaching the bustling farmer's market, we could immediately see the array of farm-fresh produce, handmade crafts, and baked goods on display. We headed first to Mr. Johnson's stall, knowing that he brings the juiciest apples and the crunchiest lettuce. Early birds like us got the finest picks, much better than the wilted leftovers during the noon rush.

Next, we scurried towards Mrs. Peters' bakery stand, the aroma of her freshly baked bread filling the air. Again, arriving early gave us the advantage of getting the warm, soft loaves, just out of the oven. As the day wore on, Mrs. Peter's beautiful pastries would disappear, leaving only a few less desirable choices.

Finally, with our bags brimming with the best produce and goods the market offered, we returned home satisfied. Arriving at the farmer's market early was indeed the key to securing the best batch. As the morning sun began to climb higher, we started preparing our meals, knowing that we had the freshest ingredients, thanks to our early morning adventure.
C. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.
D. There are days when I'm knee-deep in paperwork and plagued by a series of never-ending office meetings that a thought crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Perhaps then, I would be researching in a lab or writing a thesis, far removed from the politics and monotony of corporate life. 

I often find myself imagining a life in an academic institution surrounded by books and great minds, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Those thoughts often come wrapped in a sense of regret, along with an acute sense of longing for a path I did not choose. And it's not just about escaping my current predicament, it's about doing something fulfilling and being a part of something bigger. 

However, I must admit that I might have romanticized the whole concept of pursuing a higher degree. The late nights working on a research paper, the pressure to publish, the uncertainty of grants and fellowships – these are aspects I conveniently overlook while daydreaming. Besides, having spent a significant amount of time in a corporate setting, I have gained practical knowledge and insights that an academic path might not have provided. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side, and it's easy to long for what we don't have while ignoring the value of what we do have.",B,"D.

His policies had lifted the nation from an economic downturn, his charismatic speeches united a previously divided people, and his transparent leadership earned him unwavering trust. The nation adored him, his approval ratings consistently soaring to incredible heights. However, he was also a firm believer in the power and necessity of democratic processes.

Jack Bryan respected the constitution more than anything, viewing it as the backbone of their nation's democratic values. Despite public clamor for him to serve another term, he was adamant about stepping down at the end of his term. The constitution allowed a president to serve only two consecutive terms, and he had already served his.

As the end of his term approached, his retirement speech became a much-anticipated event. He addressed the nation, thanking them for their support, urging them to maintain unity, and encouraging them to respect the constitutional process. He retired with grace and dignity, cementing his legacy as a president who was not only greatly loved but also deeply respected for upholding the constitution. Despite the nation's wish for him to stay on, they held great respect for his firm stand on constitutional adherence.
B. Philip was a dedicated software engineer, a genius in his own right, engrossed in a challenging project. It was a complicated task that required immense concentration and his complete attention. Thus, Philip decided he needed to dedicate an entire day solely to this project, eliminating all potential distractions.

Before plunging into his work, he looked around at his desk cluttered with a multitude of devices, each pinging with notifications and reminders. Aware of their tempting, disruptive potential, he resolved to turn every single one of them off, a decision he rarely made. He powered down his smartphone, tablet, and even his smartwatch, silencing all of his digital diversions. A feeling of silence enveloped him, which was alien yet oddly comforting.

With the distractions abated, Philip found himself entirely in the zone, solving complex coding problems he had previously found insurmountable. The day stretched into evening, and Philip remained engrossed in his work, only pausing for the briefest of breaks. By the time the moon was high in the sky, Philip finally sat back, satisfied. His day of intense focus had paid off, he had completed his project, proving to himself the power of undisturbed concentration.
C. Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.
D. I'm a firm believer in the importance of a good work-life balance. However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question. But despite the exhaustion, I managed to meet each and every deadline, proving to myself that sometimes, bending the rules of work-life balance is necessary for success.",C,"```

119,We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat.,"As college students, we are always excited and anxious about the beginning of a new semester. The process of course registration is the first step to entering this new phase of our academic journey. Each semester, we are given the liberty to choose our courses and customize our learning experience. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. 

One major challenge we face during this time is getting a seat in the course we wish to register for. Some courses are extremely popular and have limited seats available. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat. 

This necessitates planning ahead and figuring out our course schedule well in advance. It's important to keep track of the dates when course registration opens and submit our choices immediately. Taking such steps ensures that we're not left out and can enjoy a fulfilling and productive semester.","A. I had been telling you for weeks, constantly pestering you to go see a doctor. But you were stubborn, choosing to ignore the persistent cough that seemed to grow worse with each passing day. I hated how you always pushed away concerns about your health, your dismissive attitude was infuriating. You continued to tell me it was nothing more than a seasonal cold, that it would pass.

One day, we woke up to the alarming sound of you gasping for breath, unable to stand on your own. We rushed to the hospital where the doctors hooked you to machines. The sterile smell of the hospital, the muffled sounds of patients and the constant beep of monitors filled the air. 

A grim looking doctor entered the room, removing his spectacles as he prepared to deliver the news. He looked at you and said, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier."" His voice carried a tone of regret and guilt, ""They still could have cured you then."" Your stubbornness had let a simple cold progress into pneumonia that was now threatening your life.
B. Ever since my childhood, I've been told that every cloud has a silver lining. The truth of that adage never really struck me until a rainy day last June. My wife, Cindy, and I were supposed to catch an early morning flight for our anniversary getaway. However, due to an unforeseen traffic jam, we missed our flight and found ourselves stranded in the bustling terminal.

At first, we were fraught with frustration and disappointment, the holiday we planned so meticulously was slipping away. Yet, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. While waiting at the crowded coffee shop inside the airport, we crossed paths with a kind old man named Charlie.

We started talking and found out that Charlie was a veteran and had led a life full of adventures. He shared stories from his travels around the world, his life lessons, and his wisdom. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met Charlie, and our world would be a little less enriched. His stories and experiences, his wisdom and his kindness became the unexpected highlight of our anniversary.
C. I've been cooking for the majority of my life, and over the years, I've accumulated an impressive array of cooking utensils. Some of them are shiny and new, flaunting an array of fancy features. Lately, there's been a new utensil in the market that's been getting quite a buzz; it's sleek, multifunctional, and apparently worth the hefty price tag. Even so, I'm not tempted.

To me, nothing can replace my old pan. It's a simple, nondescript thing, with a worn-out handle and the faint traces of countless meals. It's this pan that has been my trusty companion in preparing countless family meals and festive feasts. The new utensil may have the latest features, but it does not have the countless memories attached to it. 

Yes, my pan may be old, it may not be the shiniest, or have the latest features, but it's dependable. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.
D. Living in the small northern town of Kjørnes, Norway, the residents understood the value of sunlight more than anyone else. It's a stark difference between the sunny days of summer and the fleeting daylight of the harsh winter. Hence, they were always thankful for the sunshine that graced their town during the brief but beautiful summer. The phrase, ""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter,"" echoed in every gathering, reminding everyone to soak in as much sun as they possibly could.

This summer was no exception. As the sun rose in the bright blue sky, children would rush out of their homes to play, their laughter ringing through the peaceful town. The adults spent their time gardening, enjoying the feeling of warmth on their skin. Barbecues, picnics, and sunbathing became the town's pastime, bringing a vibrant energy that only came with the summer sunshine.

However, as the days began to shorten, a sense of urgency hung in the air. They knew that they needed to cherish every sunbeam, every light-filled day, as they would soon retreat to a world of ice and darkness. Regardless, they remained resilient, embracing the inevitable winter, while always looking forward to the next summer’s sunshine.",A,s 2018.0 18. 18. 8. 18. 8. 8. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.
120,"When the site was just discovered and undeveloped, Larry was able to purchase the home for a low price. Now, the price has risen to the point where even Will cannot afford it.","Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it. Larry's keen foresight had paid off, leaving him with not just a house, but a treasure trove.","A. James leaned back in his chair, gently gesturing toward Mike, who sat across the room, nursing a cup of coffee. ""Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details,"" he suggested, his eyes flickering with empathy towards his friend. 

Everyone's attention turned to Mike, who was staring blankly into his cup. He looked up, surprised at first but then realizing he had a captive audience. A mild hush fell over the room, the air filled with anticipation and curiosity. 

Drawing a long breath, he began recounting the events of that fateful day. ""I still remember, it was a crisp autumn morning,"" he began, setting the mood, his words echoing in the silent room. His voice quivered slightly as he shared the horrifying experience he had with a home intruder the previous week. 

He described the paralyzing fear, the life-threatening confrontation and the relief when the police finally arrived. The room remained silent as the details unfolded, everyone listening attentively, taking in the raw and honest account of his ordeal. His story filled the room with a palpable tension, the listeners sympathetically sharing his fear, his struggle, and ultimately, his relief.

C. Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.
D. Ever since he was a child, Jacob had dreamed of owning a big house and a stylish car. He imagined himself living in luxury, with vast rooms filled with opulent furnishings and a sleek, shiny car parked in the driveway. Now, at the age of twenty-three, Jacob was determined to turn those dreams into reality.

One day, Jacob confided his ambitions in his father. He talked enthusiastically about buying a big house and a sophisticated car, his eyes shining with desire and excitement. However, his father, a man of modest means and practical wisdom, gave him a serious look.

""Jacob,"" he said in a firm yet caring voice, ""It's good to have dreams. It's even better to have the ambition to achieve them. But before you start thinking about buying a house or a car, you need to have a stable income. I would advise you to get a job first.""

The words of his father resonated with Jacob, making him rethink his impulsive plans. He realized that before he could begin building his dream life, he would first need to build a solid foundation. So he set his immediate sights on finding a good job, with the dreams of a big house and a car kept safely in his heart for the future.",B,"# 10001

121,"To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable.","As the sun began to peek over the horizon, I turned to my wife and declared, ""To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable."" She agreed, as she too craved the freshest, ripest fruits and vegetables for our kitchen. We prepared swiftly, eager to encounter the magic that the early morning market held.

Upon reaching the bustling farmer's market, we could immediately see the array of farm-fresh produce, handmade crafts, and baked goods on display. We headed first to Mr. Johnson's stall, knowing that he brings the juiciest apples and the crunchiest lettuce. Early birds like us got the finest picks, much better than the wilted leftovers during the noon rush.

Next, we scurried towards Mrs. Peters' bakery stand, the aroma of her freshly baked bread filling the air. Again, arriving early gave us the advantage of getting the warm, soft loaves, just out of the oven. As the day wore on, Mrs. Peter's beautiful pastries would disappear, leaving only a few less desirable choices.

Finally, with our bags brimming with the best produce and goods the market offered, we returned home satisfied. Arriving at the farmer's market early was indeed the key to securing the best batch. As the morning sun began to climb higher, we started preparing our meals, knowing that we had the freshest ingredients, thanks to our early morning adventure.","A. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.

C. Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.
D. Once there was a young woman named Amelia, just entering her 20s. She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.",B,A.
122,"You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate. Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic.","In the heart of the bustling city of Washington D.C, a young and ambitious senator, John, received an urgent call. His assistant, Martha, breathlessly told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate."" John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward. When he finally arrived at the Senate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had heeded Martha's advice and left immediately.","A. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.
B. John had always been a hard worker. He'd arrive at the office before everyone else and would be the last to leave, ensuring that all his assignments were done promptly and correctly. His dedication was unshakeable, and it didn't go unnoticed. 

Recently, management had held a meeting, discussing the various improvements in company processes. John's name was mentioned frequently, many complimenting his diligence and commitment to his job. The executives were impressed by his accomplishments and his ability to inspire his colleagues. The decision was then made, a vote unanimous in favor of acknowledging John's efforts.

When the announcement came, John was taken aback. His superiors congratulated him, thanking him for his tireless work and positive influence on the team. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion, a well-deserved reward for his relentless determination and commitment to the company.
C. Samantha had always been a frugal young woman. The amount she had in her savings account was the result of years of careful spending and diligent saving. It was a security blanket, a nest egg for future endeavors, and possibly emergencies. And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue. She figured it was better to wait a few months when the rush of holiday travelers would die down, and prices would drop. By then, she would still have a substantial amount left in her savings after purchasing a ticket, and could even have extra money for her trip. In this way, Samantha was ensuring that she would not only have a memorable trip but also a financially secure future.
D. Emily and John had been business partners for years and they always worked things out smoothly. But, this time it was different. It was about a business proposal that needed immediate attention and a crucial decision. John, out of over-confidence or ignorance, didn't discuss the problem with Emily right then and there.

Emily got the news the next day when the proposal fell apart. She was furious. ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" she lamented to John, her voice echoing throughout their office. She tried to keep her emotions under control, but it was difficult. ""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" she added, her eyes filled with a rare frustration.

John, understanding his lapse, felt guilt welling up inside him. He didn't want the partnership, built over mutual trust and understanding, to suffer due to his momentary lapse of judgment. He realized the need for immediate action to correct this error. In the silence of their office, he vowed to make things right, no matter how much effort it demanded from him. He hoped his efforts could preserve their relationship and rectify the problem he had caused in their business partnership.",D,"```

123,"Between six and eight in the morning is when most of the museum visitors arrive. So, you should come one hour before then to avoid the crowd.","Joanna had always been a planner. So, when she decided to visit the city museum, she spent the evening strategizing the perfect timing. She knew that most of the museum visitors arrived between six and eight in the morning. The thought of having to negotiate her way through a crowd did not appeal to her.

Looking online, she found a blog suggesting that the ideal time to visit the museum was one hour before the peak hours. It wasn't just about beating the crowd, but also the opportunity to enjoy the exhibits in quiet reflection. Hence, she decided to arrive at the museum at five, an hour earlier than most visitors.

The next morning, she got ready and reached the museum at five sharp. As she stepped into the empty corridors of the museum, she was delighted. She had the entire place to herself, able to take her time and truly appreciate the exhibits. Joanna smiled, knowing her plan had worked out perfectly.","A. Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack, a highly esteemed entrepreneur in town. He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.
B. During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.

D. Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer.

124,"I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.","I have always been one to admire bold, vibrant colours. Deep reds, cobalt blues and vibrant oranges that make a statement, that catch your eye even from afar. You, on the other hand, decided to get a soft muted beige car, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.

""I don’t really like the colour of your car,"" I remember saying to you one sunny afternoon, as we sat on the porch, sipping on homemade lemonade. I even pointed to your car, parked at the curb, as if you didn't know which one I was referring to.

You laughed, a soft chuckle that had me smirking, before setting down your glass on the table. ""I figured as much,"" you responded, a teasing glint in your eyes. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.""

I had to concede, knowing you had a point. After all, you were always drawn to the softer, subtler things in life, that found beauty in simplicity, and it was one of the many reasons I adored you. So although I may not have agreed with your choice of car colour, I could still appreciate why you chose it. It was, after all, very you.","A. Derek, the seasoned poker player, stared intently at the hand he was dealt. His cool, calm, collected exterior masked the thrill rushing through his veins. After hours of mediocre hands, this was the one he'd been waiting for - a straight flush in spades. The corners of his lips tilted upwards in a barely visible smile. 

Across the table, his opponents, a tough group of poker regulars, continued their tactical bluffing, unaware of Derek's excitement. He matched their bets without hesitation, his confident eyes never wavering. Round after round, he kept calling, his pile of chips dwindling steadily. 

Finally, the last round arrived and with a deep breath, Derek pushed his remaining chips into the center. He had staked all his money, leaving his fate at the mercy of the cards. The room held its breath, waiting for the reveal, intrigued to see whether Derek's confidence was well-founded or misplaced.
B. David was an IT specialist working in a fast-paced tech firm. Lately, he had been falling behind on his workload, his usually impeccable performance dwindling. It had become apparent that David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager. The warnings he had received from his superiors for not meeting his deadlines echoed in his mind, creating a nerve-wracking atmosphere around him.

To make things worse, a crucial project had just been assigned to his team: the setup of a brand new system. This was not just any system but was destined to be the backbone of the company's operations. David knew this was his chance to redeem himself and restore his reputation.

With a sense of urgency and determination, David scrambled to start the project. He dived into the coding and configuration process with unprecedented intensity, working late nights to ensure the system's successful implementation. His colleagues watched in awe as David, driven by the urgency of his situation, worked tirelessly to setup the new system from scratch.

By the end of the month, the new system was not only up and running, but it was also surpassing everyone's expectations. David's hard work and devotion had saved his reputation, proving that he was, indeed, an invaluable asset to his team and the company.
C. For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.
D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics, seeing it merely as a jumble of numbers and variables that are not relatable to everyday life. Often, they regard math as a complicated series of equations and formulas to memorize. However, this perspective does not do justice to the richness and depth of this discipline. To me, mathematics is the most meaningful subject.

From an early age, I've always been fascinated by the harmony and precision found in mathematical concepts. The pure logic and absolute certainty captured in mathematical proofs provide a sense of satisfaction and comfort that no other subject can offer. As I manipulate figures and calculate equations, I feel a connection with the universe's fundamental laws and principles.

Every formula and theorem in mathematics reveals something profound about our world. It expresses abstract ideas like infinity and simplicity with an elegant language of numbers and symbols. Despite its complexity, the beauty of mathematics lies in its simplicity, consistency, and its ability to describe the world with absolute precision.

The process of solving a mathematical problem is like an exciting journey of discovery. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving a complex equation is unparalleled. This is the beauty I find in mathematics, making it, for me, the most meaningful subject.",D,#CoverCovid19 #Covid19Vaccine #VaccineEquity #VaccineJustice #VaccineAccess #VaccineHesitancy #VaccineMisinformation #VaccineSafety #VaccineEfficacy #VaccineScience #VaccineResearch #VaccineDevelopment #VaccineHope #VaccineSolidarity #VaccineUnity #VaccineForAll #VaccineEquality #VaccineJustice #VaccineAccessNow #VaccineAccessibility #VaccineDistribution #VaccineRollout #VaccineEducation #VaccineLiteracy #VaccineMisconceptions #VaccineMyths #VaccineTruth #VaccineFacts #VaccineKnowledge #VaccineAwareness #VaccineUnderstanding #VaccineSupport #VaccineEncouragement #VaccineInspiration #VaccineEmpowerment #VaccineCommunity #VaccineSolidarity #VaccineUnity #VaccineForAll #VaccineEquality #VaccineJustice #VaccineAccessNow #VaccineAccessibility #VaccineDistribution #VaccineRollout #VaccineE
125,"She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary.","Jane has always seen things that others don't. Ever since childhood, she's been drawn to the unusual, the ordinary that's seen from an extraordinary lens. John, an average man in the eyes of the general public, caught her attention on a regular day at her usual coffee shop. He was standing behind the counter, blending with the mundane scene around him. But not for Jane.

From his ginger hair, slightly tousled, to his freckles adorning his face like constellations; everything about him was perfect to her. She saw the way his green eyes would light up when he made a good cup of coffee or the way his face crinkled up when he laughed. To her, he was a masterpiece, the embodiment of everything charming and attractive. She found herself falling for his uniqueness, his ordinariness that so many seemed to overlook.

Even though her friends saw him as nothing but an average joe, Jane cherished this man who, to her, stood out as the most attractive man in the world. Her heart fluttered every time she thought of him, every time she saw him. Because to her, he was more than just ordinary, he was extraordinary.","A. John had been working as a software engineer for nearly a decade and developed a knack for understanding and fixing technical glitches. Because of his expertise, friends often approached him with their tech problems. One day, his friend, Lisa, approached him with a desperate expression on her face. Her laptop, which contained all her work and personal data, was refusing to boot up.

""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" John told her regretfully, ""it would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" He explained that the problem was a corrupt operating system. If it had been caught early on, he could have potentially restored the system or saved her data. However, the damage was now too extensive, and the system irreparable.

""But now, you may need to buy a new one,"" he suggested, noting her shocked expression. Although it was unfortunate news, John hoped that next time, Lisa would seek help immediately upon noticing an issue to avoid such a disastrous situation.
B. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.
C. My brother and I share a love for music, but our tastes can be worlds apart. His music tastes lean more towards pop and R&B, while I am more of a hard rock and alternative enthusiast. There is one particular singer that has captured my brother's admiration, someone whose vocals and techniques seem to utterly enchant him. Although this artist isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.

He would spend countless hours singing along to his songs and watching his concerts on YouTube. The singer's delicate control over his voice, how he subtly transitioned from soft and mellow to high and powerful notes, seemed to mesmerize my brother. He'd even taken to practicing the same techniques, humming the singer's songs in the shower or when he was alone in his room.

Yet for me, his music was a little too slow and didn't carry the energy and angst I preferred. I tried to appreciate it, for the sake of my brother, but it didn't quite resonate with me. But even though this singer wasn't my favorite, I respected his talent and more importantly, the joy he brought to my brother.
D. The summer of 2016 was unforgettable, as it was filled with a fantastic vacation my family and I had been planning for months. We had decided to embark on a month-long exploration trip across Europe, seeing the sights and soaking in the culture of different countries. The first week was spent roaming the beautiful, love-filled streets of Paris, where we ascended the Eiffel Tower and indulged in scrumptious, traditional French cuisine. 

Our second destination was the historically rich city of Rome, Italy, where we marveled at the grandeur of the Colosseum and indulged in some of the best pizzas and pastas. After Italy, we moved on to Spain, where we enjoyed the lively Flamenco dances and the unique architecture in Barcelona. The magic of these experiences was amplified by the bond my family and I shared, as we created countless memories and grew closer with every passing day. 

As each day passed, our holiday got better, leaving us yearning for more adventures and experiences. Yet, the final week came all too soon, and we found ourselves back home, unpacking our suitcases and hanging up the photos we took. We sighed, missing the vibrancy and excitement that our vacation had brought. It was indeed a fantastic vacation, but as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.",C,"```

126,The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.,"The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. It's a bulky Dell model from 2006, dust collecting on its worn-out keys, and the other employees often joke about it. They can't comprehend why Lexi, the young, tech-savvy graphic designer, would choose such an obsolete piece of equipment. But she really enjoys using it.

There's something nostalgic about it; the satisfying click-clack of the keys, the faint humming noise, the old operating system. It reminds her of her first computer she got as a kid when she discovered her love for design. She was always fascinated by how she could create beautiful things with such a simple tool.

Lexi feels her creativity flowing more freely when she works on her old laptop, as if it's a part of her. The way she sees it, her best work comes not from the latest technology, but from her heart and dedication. So, until it completely gives out on her, she'll continue to cherish the oldest laptop in the office. Even though it's more antiquated than the others, for Lexi, it's priceless.","A. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.
B. Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.
C. We arrived at the meeting point, a small café downtown, around noon. The sky was brilliantly clear, the air heavy with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You, however, were nowhere to be found. We exchanged glances but decided to wait, hoping that the traffic was the cause of your delay.

An hour passed, followed by another, and soon it was three hours. Our coffees had turned cold, our spirits were slightly low but there was a strange determination in our hearts. ""We have been waiting for you for three hours,"" I remember Susan murmured. Yet, her voice lacked any trace of annoyance or frustration. Instead, there was an element of forgiveness, and she added, ""But that's okay. It’s better late than never.""

They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.","A. Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack, a highly esteemed entrepreneur in town. He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.

C. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.
D. Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick.

B. Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike.

Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
B. For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.
C. Many people often cringe when they hear about the color combination of orange and green. They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.
D. John had been training for months for his first marathon. He was no stranger to running, but marathons were an entirely new ballgame. His coach had given him one primary advice, ""Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon,"" he had said. 

John remembered his words clearly. He felt the thrill of the starting gunshot echoing in his ears. An impulse surged through him to dash off with the crowd, but he reined in his energy. He had trained hard and didn't want to waste his endurance in the first few miles. 

Instead, he started at a manageable pace. As he passed each mile, he slowly increased his speed. This strategy kept him fresh even in the later stages of the race, and as he crossed the finish line, he knew he had done it right. His adherence to maintaining a steady pace and avoiding a rapid start paid off. The joy of completion paired with a decent time made all his efforts worthwhile. His first marathon was a success, all thanks to his wise pacing.",C,"```

130,"We have been waiting for you for 3 hours, but that's okay. It’s better late than never.","We arrived at the meeting point, a small café downtown, around noon. The sky was brilliantly clear, the air heavy with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You, however, were nowhere to be found. We exchanged glances but decided to wait, hoping that the traffic was the cause of your delay.

An hour passed, followed by another, and soon it was three hours. Our coffees had turned cold, our spirits were slightly low but there was a strange determination in our hearts. ""We have been waiting for you for three hours,"" I remember Susan murmured. Yet, her voice lacked any trace of annoyance or frustration. Instead, there was an element of forgiveness, and she added, ""But that's okay. It’s better late than never.""","A. Once upon a time, Olive was a commonly discussed name at the family's dinner table. He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

After that, no one in the family spoke about Olive anymore. Over time, he became the ""black sheep,"" the name that was avoided in conversations, the son who had stained their good name. Despite the love they once had for him, Olive's actions had ultimately led to his exclusion from the family.
B. Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.
C. Mary had always admired Rose Donovan, a renowned novelist who had never attended college. She was enthralled by Rose's captivating words and the worlds she conjured in her readers' minds. Thus, when the teenage years brought about their inevitable angst, Mary found herself disillusioned with school.

She thought to herself that if Rose Donovan, her favorite writer, could create such beauty without a college education, then perhaps she too could follow the same path. With this in mind, Mary made a decision that stunned her family. Against their advice and pleas, Mary dropped out of school, intending to immerse herself in the craft of writing.

At first, it was exciting, the freedom and the sense of rebellion invigorating. However, she soon realized that the journey she had embarked on was not as glamorous as she thought. There were countless days and nights of feeling inadequate, of her work feeling subpar. Over time, Mary came to understand that she should not have dropped out of school to follow in the footsteps of her favorite writer, as each path to success is different, and some require a harder, longer journey than others.
D. When I first started the training program, I was brimming with confidence. I was certain that I would breeze through it in the estimated one year. Unfortunately, life had other plans, and I faced unexpected challenges that made it impossible for me to complete it within the suggested timeframe. My mother's sudden illness required me to return home and take over the family business.

I remember thinking that I had failed, that I wouldn't get the chance to complete my training. Yet, I didn't let that deter me completely. I continued the program while juggling responsibilities at home. It took me twice as long as most of my peers, extending my training into three years instead of the projected one. There were times I wanted to give up, but I held on, fueled by sheer determination. The journey took longer than expected, but at least I have the credential now, proving that endurance and resilience can overcome the toughest of circumstances.",D,
131,"Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter.","Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter. This wasn't just any letter, it was a letter of apology that took me countless drafts and revisions to get just right. I'd been wrestling with my feelings for so long, knowing I had wronged a dear friend and not knowing how to mend the damage.

Night after night, I poured my thoughts and remorse onto paper, only to crumple it up and throw it away. The words never seemed to adequately express my regret. The sense of shame and guilt gnawed at my conscience every day. I was on edge, wondering if the friendship I had ruined would ever be salvaged.

Finally, after two grueling weeks, I had a version I was somewhat satisfied with. I remember walking to the post office with a trembling hand, slipping the envelope into the mailbox, feeling a strange sense of relief mixed with apprehension. I knew I had done my part in seeking forgiveness, and all that was left was to hope my friend would understand.","A. Mary was known in her quaint town not just for her cheerful demeanor, but also for her extensive rose garden. She was incredibly proud of it and often boasted that her rose garden was the best in the entire city. She would lovingly prune the roses every day, her hand skimming over the vibrant hues with a sense of satisfaction and adoration. 

However, anyone who visited Mary's place would be far from impressed. To the outsider's eye, Mary's garden was nothing but ordinary. The roses were indeed beautiful, but they were the common variety that could be found anywhere in the city. 

Her rose bushes were not meticulously manicured, and the arrangement of her plants lacked imagination. There were no benches or fountains, nor were there any artistic sculptures that were often seen in other local gardens. The paths were not lined with charming pebbles, and there was no pergola under which one could rest.

In reality, Mary's garden, despite her pride and joy, was just like any other in the city. But in her eyes, the love and time she invested made it the most extraordinary garden of all.
B. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. It's a bulky Dell model from 2006, dust collecting on its worn-out keys, and the other employees often joke about it. They can't comprehend why Lexi, the young, tech-savvy graphic designer, would choose such an obsolete piece of equipment. But she really enjoys using it.

There's something nostalgic about it; the satisfying click-clack of the keys, the faint humming noise, the old operating system. It reminds her of her first computer she got as a kid when she discovered her love for design. She was always fascinated by how she could create beautiful things with such a simple tool.

Lexi feels her creativity flowing more freely when she works on her old laptop, as if it's a part of her. The way she sees it, her best work comes not from the latest technology, but from her heart and dedication. So, until it completely gives out on her, she'll continue to cherish the oldest laptop in the office. Even though it's more antiquated than the others, for Lexi, it's priceless.
C. Rosalind had always been a strong-willed woman, driven by her principles. She held an unwavering belief in owning her mistakes and taking responsibility. However, when she wronged her best friend, Abigail, she found herself straying from her own rules. The incident happened during their annual Christmas party. In a fit of jealousy and misunderstanding, Rosalind had wrongly accused Abigail of trying to steal her boyfriend.

It took her a week to realize that her accusation had been mistaken; her boyfriend had been the one who initiated the flirtation. As she saw her friendship with Abigail crumble and fall apart, guilt and regret started to eat her alive. However, she let her pride get in the way, which stopped her from immediately apologizing and confessing to Abigail. Her ego created a barrier, and two painful years passed, with their friendship left in tatters.

Finally, she gathered the courage to swallow her pride and reach out to her friend. Rosalind wrote a heartfelt apology to Abigail, confessing to her mistake and expressing her deep regret. She wasn't sure if Abigail would forgive her, but she knew she had to take the first step to mend their broken friendship.
D. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.",C,"#include <iostream>

132,"A friend of mine who had failed 12th grade for the last five years, finally succeeded to pass.","Jake, a friend of mine, had been trapped in the 12th grade for the last five years. His academic journey had been a rollercoaster ride, filled with numerous obstacles and failures. It seemed like the universe was conspiring to prevent Jake from achieving his dream of graduating high school. Every year, he would start the academic term with a fervor, attending classes, participating actively, and submitting all his assignments on time. 

However, as the school year wore on, he would lose his momentum, often finding himself unable to keep up with his classmates. This became a recurring pattern, earning him the dubious honor of being the oldest student in our grade. His spirit was dampened, but his determination to pass was unwavering. He enlisted tutors, spent countless hours studying and sought advice from previous graduates.

Finally, in his sixth attempt, the persistent efforts of Jake bore fruit. With a weary yet triumphant smile, Jake held up his high school diploma, finally succeeding to pass the 12th grade, proof that persistence and dedication can overcome even the toughest of hurdles.","A. Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.

C. George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.
D. In the heart of the warm, comforting living room, a scene of serenity unfolded. A baby was nestled securely in a plush, patchwork blanket, resting peacefully next to her mother. This was not just any blanket; it was a token from her grandmother, each stitched square telling a unique story of family heritage and love. The baby, despite being unaware of the tales woven into the fabric, felt the warmth and safety it radiated. 

She lay there, her tiny fingers curled up around her mother's shirt, her soft breaths rising and falling rhythmically. She was as snug as a bug in a rug, a picture of innocent bliss. Her mother gazed down at her with a love so vast it seemed to fill the room. The soft flicker of the fire casting gentle shadows on their peaceful figures. 

The rest of the world ceased to exist for the pair, their world momentarily reduced to this cocoon of warmth and love. This night was a precious moment etched into the canvas of their lives, a symbol of the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child.",B,"2016th of March 2018

The economic depression that began to grip the nation was not a sudden event. In fact, it was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies that had been implemented over a period of years. The government, in a bid to stimulate economic growth, had begun to invest heavily in risky ventures.

Early on, the nation had seen a surge in economic activity. It seemed for a while that the risky policies were actually paying off. Yet, a keen observer would have noticed the unsustainable trajectory of this growth. Many companies, fueled by reckless investments, were expanding at a rate far beyond their means.

However, the bubble burst when these companies began defaulting on their loans. Banks, suddenly faced with massive losses, began to tighten their loan policies. As credit began to dry up, businesses started to fold, leading to layoffs and the economic depression. Therefore, it can be seen that this depression was not a random event, but a consequence of several risky fiscal policies.
B. Lake Erie is a beautiful and serene body of water, located in the northern part of the United States. This vast expanse of water is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from all corners of the world. Yet, one of the most fascinating aspects of Lake Erie is not just its beauty, but the role it plays in the complex and fascinating hydrological system of the Great Lakes.

Lake Erie drains its waters into another of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario. This transition of waters occurs via an extraordinary body of water, the Niagara River. The river is relatively short, merely 36 miles long, but plays an essential role in the transfer of waters between these two Great Lakes.

However, the journey from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not a simple, direct flow. The waters pass through a remarkable natural spectacle, the Niagara Falls. The thunderous roar of the Falls and the misty aura created by the falling water is a mesmerizing sight.

This journey of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is more than a geographical process. It serves as an embodiment of the dynamism and interconnectedness of nature. Above all, it's a reminder of the impermanence of things and the constancy of change, as the waters of Lake Erie perpetually flow into Lake Ontario, continuing the endless cycle of life.

D. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy.

134,Clark took 10 years to propose to Cece. We all had lost hope but finally he came through.,"Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.","A. We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.

C. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
D. Fred was a crafty man, renowned for his sharp mind and razor-like wit. He was a natural wheeler and dealer, with an uncanny knack for exploiting opportunities. Unfortunately, these opportunities were often at the expense of others, for Fred made his wealth by swindling innocent people out of their hard-earned money.

For years, Fred's empires were built on deceit and treachery, promising wealth and prosperity to those who could hardly afford to lose. He lived lavishly, often seen with the most expensive suits, the fastest cars, and the most beautiful companions. His immense fortune was the talk of the town, admired by many and despised by the ones he tricked.

However, Fred's life took a drastic turn when he became the target of his own game. A man as clever and ruthless as he was approached him with an irresistible business deal. Fred, always hungry for more, didn't notice the glaring red flags and invested his entire wealth into the venture.

But the deal was a sham, designed meticulously to strip Fred of his immense fortune. He lost it all in the blink of an eye, falling victim to the same swindling strategies he had once used. The irony was not lost on those who had suffered at his hands, and Fred was left with nothing, a poignant reminder of his deceptive past.",B,"C. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge."
135,"Although she realized the mistake a week after the incident, she waited two years before finally apologizing and confessing.","Rosalind had always been a strong-willed woman, driven by her principles. She held an unwavering belief in owning her mistakes and taking responsibility. However, when she wronged her best friend, Abigail, she found herself straying from her own rules. The incident happened during their annual Christmas party. In a fit of jealousy and misunderstanding, Rosalind had wrongly accused Abigail of trying to steal her boyfriend.

It took her a week to realize that her accusation had been mistaken; her boyfriend had been the one who initiated the flirtation. As she saw her friendship with Abigail crumble and fall apart, guilt and regret started to eat her alive. However, she let her pride get in the way, which stopped her from immediately apologizing and confessing to Abigail. Her ego created a barrier, and two painful years passed, with their friendship left in tatters.

Finally, she gathered the courage to swallow her pride and reach out to her friend. Rosalind wrote a heartfelt apology to Abigail, confessing to her mistake and expressing her deep regret. She wasn't sure if Abigail would forgive her, but she knew she had to take the first step to mend their broken friendship.","A. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.
B. Once upon a time, there was a flourishing tech company named Digitech, known for its innovative solutions and game-changing technology. However, over the years, their strategic management started losing its grip. The company's focus shifted from enhancing their technology and pleasing customers to mindless expansion and reckless spending. Gradually, the consequences began to appear in the company's financial health.

Digitech started to sink into an abyss of debts due to this erratic management. They kept on acquiring more and more loans to cover their extravagant expenses, creating a vicious cycle. It got to a point where the debts were so astronomical that they overshadowed the company's worth. The company was so debt-ridden that there seemed to be no silver lining in sight.

The staff grew anxious with the looming bankruptcy, and their efficiency dropped considerably. Looking at the horrid financial state and the demotivated employees, I thought it was safe to say that Digitech was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy. It was a painful sight seeing such a once vibrant company facing a downfall due to mismanagement and imprudence.
C. George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.
D. Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.",D,"```

136,"Don’t invest all your money in the stock market, you should never put all your eggs in one basket.","John was always one to take risks. His adrenaline-pumping adventures ranged from skydiving to deep-sea diving. Yet, the most thrilling adventure for him was the stock market. The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket."" John took the advice to heart, and rather than rushing into one venture, he wisely decided to spread his investments, realizing the importance of not betting everything on a single possibility.","A. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.
B. Kate had always been a hardworking and dedicated employee, until one day, she was unjustly fired from her job. The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively. She started looking for a new job, determined to move on from the past and prove her worth elsewhere.
C. Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.
D. Karen had always been the type of friend who valued openness and honesty. Thus, when she discovered that Sandy, her best friend since grade school, had made plans for the summer without informing her, she felt a sting of betrayal. 

For years, they had shared every intricate detail of their lives, right down to what they had for breakfast. That's why Sandy's silence about her summer plans had taken Karen aback. It wasn't that Karen expected to be included in every aspect of Sandy's life, but the sudden change in their routine felt abrupt and unexpected.

Consequently, a seed of doubt and apprehension was planted in Karen's mind. She started to question their entire friendship. The insecurity made her revisit their shared memories with a more suspicious eye.

Karen decided to confront Sandy about it. She hoped that discussing her feelings would bring clarity to the situation and reassure her about the strength of their bond. But the question remained, would Sandy understand Karen's concern or would this incident drive a wedge between them?",A,s are a good ones who are not the ones who are not the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones who were the ones
137,It would be better if you applied to several companies instead of just one.,"Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.","A. Throughout the radiant summer months, our humble town was famed for one thing above all - our irresistibly delicious mangoes. Luscious, juicy, and oh-so-sweet, they painted a tropical picture so vivid that it could make anyone forget the relentless summer heat. However, the golden rule everyone lived by was; when the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes.

It was true. As the sweltering sun receded and the cool fall breeze took its place, the mango trees would bid goodbye to their precious bounty. The trees would strip down, bare and empty, bearing no fruit until the next year's summer. So, as the rule goes, devour them while you can. 

Children and adults alike took this message to heart. Backyards were filled with laughter and joy as families huddled together, relishing the sweet and sticky sensation of mangoes. Every bite was an ode to the fleeting summer, a memory to be cherished until the next season, when we would once again have access to such delicious mangoes. The town was united not just by the love for these tropical delights, but also the looming melancholy that came with the changing seasons.
B. There once was a mischievous boy, living in a small village nestled against a foreboding forest, who took great delight in tricking his fellow villagers. To pass the time, he would call out, ""Wolf! Wolf!"", feigning distress, causing the hard-working villagers to drop everything to come to his aid. He would then laugh, and his laughter echoed throughout the peaceful valley, disrupting the quiet serenity that usually prevailed. This happened time and time again, until the villagers started to lose patience with the little boy's pranks. 

One cold winter day, the boy, emboldened by past success, repeated his false cry. But this time, nobody hurried to his rescue, weary of his previous false alarms. Unbeknownst to them, however, this time, the cry was authentic. A pack of starving wolves had strayed from the forest, drawn by the scent of the village's livestock. The boy was terrified as the fierce creatures came closer and closer, his desperate cries for help fading into the chilling wind. Ultimately, the boy who cried wolf learned a grave and costly lesson, earning his comeuppance the day the wolves really came.
C. John had always been a hard worker, who believed in doing things right the first time. He had a mantra: doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run. Every task he took on, he ensured it was done with meticulous care and attention. 

One day, he was assigned a complex project at work. His colleagues, Mike and Nancy, believed in taking shortcuts to finish the tasks quickly. They mocked John for his painstaking approach. John, however, didn't let their mockery deter him and he continued with his methodical approach. 

Weeks later, the project was presented to their boss. Mike and Nancy's hasty work resulted in many errors, leading to the project being sent back for corrections. John, on the other hand, had a flawless presentation, which not only impressed the boss, but also earned him a promotion. His mantra had once again proven to be true; doing your work thoroughly and responsibly really did help him avoid problems in the long run.
D. Growing up in a diverse city, Sam always believed that having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people. This belief originated from his childhood, where he always felt enriched by different cultural experiences. Being a food lover, he loved trying diverse cuisines. His group of foodie friends always had something interesting planned, from authentic Indian curries to Italian pasta workshops.

On the other hand, Sam was a sports enthusiast as well. He had a separate group of friends who shared his love for football. Every weekend they would gather in the local park, pick teams, and enjoy intense football matches. Their bond strengthened during the world cup when they used to gather at Sam's house, cheering for their favourite teams.

His intellectual thirst was satisfied by his book club friends. They met once every month to discuss a book they had all read. Their conversations, heated debates, and perspectives helped Sam broaden his outlook on life. Thus, by maintaining different social groups, Sam was able to find companionship and a sense of belonging while pursuing his varied interests.",D,"s and the 2016

138,"He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, but when it failed, he was ruined. He realized that he should have had other backup plans.","John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.","A. Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy. This principle was engraved into his heart by his parents, especially when it came to his professional life. He knew that lying to land a job could possibly offer a temporary success but it certainly was not a sustainable solution.

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.

C. Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.
D. As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.",B,"```

139,"It is important to keep learning new skills and not rely on one skill for your career. With emerging technology, current skills may become outdated in the future.","Paul had always lived by his father's mantra, ""It is important to keep learning new skills and not rely on one skill for your career."" He had spent over a decade honing his skills as a talented typographer. His designs were intricate and brought a unique touch to any piece of work that employed his typography. However, the growing influence of digital technology in his field made him realize that his specialized skill might not suffice.

The advent of automated design tools began threatening his once sought-after profession. Paul saw that these tools could do what took him days within minutes. It was a frightening revelation that with emerging technology, current skills, even his cherished typography, may become outdated in the future. 

Realizing this, he decided to adapt to the changing times. He started investing time into learning graphic design software and digital marketing skills. His willingness to learn ensured that his career stayed relevant and growing even in an evolving technological landscape.","A. The match was in Philadelphia; the city was charged with excitement and anticipation. The game was baseball, Philadelphia's own Phillies against their formidable opponent, the Dodgers. The stadium was swarming with fans, both sides buzzing with unbridled excitement.

From the first inning, it was evident that the game would be no cakewalk for either team. The Phillies displayed an impeccable form, their pitcher hurling the baseball with precision and speed. However, the Dodgers were just as tenacious. With every pitch, they countered with agility, their bats swishing through the air, keeping the score neck-and-neck. 

As the game extended into the ninth inning, it became clear that victory was within reach for both teams. The Phillies, however, drew upon a surge of energy and managed to score a critical run. Though the Dodgers were just as good and came close to the win, their efforts fell short. In the end, it was Philly who clinically secured the game, much to the delight of their home crowd.
B. I noticed you were pretty disappointed that you missed out on Jason's party last Saturday. Honestly, at first, I thought you would've had a great time there with all your friends. Jason's parties are always epic and you were looking forward to it all week. 

However, it turned out to be quite different this time. The music was ridiculously loud, louder than any party I've ever heard of, and it continued late into the night. The partygoers were enjoying themselves, completely oblivious to the disturbance they were causing. 

The otherwise calm and peaceful neighborhood couldn't bear the noise and chaos. It was Mr. Johnson, our next-door neighbor, who lost his patience first. Disturbed and frustrated, he decided to call the police. Hence, it is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.
C. Laura was a budding indie artist, preparing to release her much-anticipated debut album. She had spent countless hours crafting the perfect melodies and lyrics, pouring her heart and soul into each song. Critics and fans alike were waiting with bated breath, convinced that Laura's album would be nothing short of a masterpiece.

The album was a collection of fourteen songs, each one a poignant story, a tiny fragment of Laura's life converted into beautiful melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The first thirteen songs were nothing short of spectacular. They resonated with the listeners, reverberating with the collective human experiences of love, loss, and healing. Every note, every strum, and every beat filled the air with an irrefutable magic, making the audience sway and sing along.

But when the last song played, a distinct discomfort filled the room. It was an upbeat pop song, a stark contrast from the beautiful melancholic tunes that characterized the rest of the album. It felt out of place and jarring, breaking the emotive spell the album had cast. All the songs on her album were amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.

140,"In familiy planning, it's wise not to trust just one childcare method. Different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing.","Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.","A. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.
B. Sally was an independent woman, living in a bustling city when she received the news that changed her life forever. Her younger brother, Mike, whom she adored dearly, had been in a fatal car accident. His sudden demise shook Sally's entire world and the void he left behind seemed impossible to fill. Despite the overwhelming grief, she realized that her aged parents were in much worse shape. 

Their world revolved around their two children, and now, they had lost one of them. Sally knew that she had to step up and comfort them despite grappling with her own pain. She had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away. With determination in her heart and tears in her eyes, she traveled back to her hometown to be by their side. 

Over time, Sally took over the responsibility of comforting her parents and helping them find hope in their darkest hour. Although the pain of their loss never truly diminished, Sally's resilience and emotional support eventually brought them a sense of peace. Her unwavering strength became the light guiding her parents through their darkest times.
C. Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.
D. Ralph has always been a detail-oriented person, but this current project of ours seemed to magnify this trait to an annoying level. We bought this old, dilapidated house on the countryside with the intention of renovating it completely. It was a huge project that required the utmost attention to every room, every nook and cranny. Despite the enormity of the task, his attention was bizarrely drawn to one particular doorknob.

This was not an ordinary doorknob, but an antique, rusted one which was hanging onto the main entrance door of our project house. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture. It confounds me how he can lose himself in the intricacies of the tarnished brass detail while ignoring the bigger tasks at hand. 

Rooms needed painting, floorboards needed replacing, and the roof definitely needed some serious work. Yet here was Ralph, consumed with researching how to restore a singular, century-old doorknob. It was a testament to his tendency to get lost in the minute details and lose sight of the larger goal, a flaw that could potentially derail our entire renovation plan.",C,#1234566778888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
141,Having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people.,"Growing up in a diverse city, Sam always believed that having different social groups is a good idea so that you can enjoy all the things you like with different kinds of people. This belief originated from his childhood, where he always felt enriched by different cultural experiences. Being a food lover, he loved trying diverse cuisines. His group of foodie friends always had something interesting planned, from authentic Indian curries to Italian pasta workshops.

On the other hand, Sam was a sports enthusiast as well. He had a separate group of friends who shared his love for football. Every weekend they would gather in the local park, pick teams, and enjoy intense football matches. Their bond strengthened during the world cup when they used to gather at Sam's house, cheering for their favourite teams.

His intellectual thirst was satisfied by his book club friends. They met once every month to discuss a book they had all read. Their conversations, heated debates, and perspectives helped Sam broaden his outlook on life. Thus, by maintaining different social groups, Sam was able to find companionship and a sense of belonging while pursuing his varied interests.","A. When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.
B. Jane has always seen things that others don't. Ever since childhood, she's been drawn to the unusual, the ordinary that's seen from an extraordinary lens. John, an average man in the eyes of the general public, caught her attention on a regular day at her usual coffee shop. He was standing behind the counter, blending with the mundane scene around him. But not for Jane.

From his ginger hair, slightly tousled, to his freckles adorning his face like constellations; everything about him was perfect to her. She saw the way his green eyes would light up when he made a good cup of coffee or the way his face crinkled up when he laughed. To her, he was a masterpiece, the embodiment of everything charming and attractive. She found herself falling for his uniqueness, his ordinariness that so many seemed to overlook.

Even though her friends saw him as nothing but an average joe, Jane cherished this man who, to her, stood out as the most attractive man in the world. Her heart fluttered every time she thought of him, every time she saw him. Because to her, he was more than just ordinary, he was extraordinary.
C. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.

142,"Don’t lie to land a job, remember that honesty is the best policy.","Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy. This principle was engraved into his heart by his parents, especially when it came to his professional life. He knew that lying to land a job could possibly offer a temporary success but it certainly was not a sustainable solution.

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.","A. Once upon a time, in a peaceful little valley, a thick forest grew near the meandering river. This was no ordinary forest; it was an enchanting mix of towering pines, emerald oaks, and myriad colorful wildflowers that danced in the wind. The river, a sparkling ribbon of blue, wound its way lazily through the forest, nourishing it with its life-giving water. Each morning, a shimmering mist would rise from the river and blanket the forest in a gentle, silvery haze.

Wildlife thrived in the forest, making the environment even more vibrant. Deer moved elegantly amongst the trees while the birds filled the air with their melodious songs. As night fell, the nocturnal creatures took over, filling the forest with their whispered conversations and soft scurrying. 

Just beyond the river, a small, picturesque village lay, inhabited by people who revered the forest and considered it a sacred entity. The villagers would often come to the river's edge to collect water, fish or simply marvel at the forest's tranquil beauty. Thus, life existed harmoniously in the quaint valley where the magical forest grew near the river.
B. Many people often cringe when they hear about the color combination of orange and green. They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.
C. You had been holding onto a secret for weeks now, a secret about your mother's favorite vase. It was an antique vase passed down in her family for generations, and you had accidentally knocked it off the table while cleaning. Its pieces were now concealed in your closet, hidden beneath piles of old clothes. Each day that passed made you feel more and more guilty about your deceit. 

Your friend, Mike, had been aware of your dilemma since the day of the accident. He insisted you should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress. He reminded you about how understanding and forgiving your mother usually was. After several days of persuasion, you finally agreed with him. So you picked up the shards of the broken vase and mustered the courage to confess. You were ready to relieve the weight that was hanging heavily on your shoulders for weeks.
D. Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.",C,"s and the other day.

143,Doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run.,"John had always been a hard worker, who believed in doing things right the first time. He had a mantra: doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run. Every task he took on, he ensured it was done with meticulous care and attention. 

One day, he was assigned a complex project at work. His colleagues, Mike and Nancy, believed in taking shortcuts to finish the tasks quickly. They mocked John for his painstaking approach. John, however, didn't let their mockery deter him and he continued with his methodical approach. 

Weeks later, the project was presented to their boss. Mike and Nancy's hasty work resulted in many errors, leading to the project being sent back for corrections. John, on the other hand, had a flawless presentation, which not only impressed the boss, but also earned him a promotion. His mantra had once again proven to be true; doing your work thoroughly and responsibly really did help him avoid problems in the long run.","A. Once upon a time, there was a flourishing tech company named Digitech, known for its innovative solutions and game-changing technology. However, over the years, their strategic management started losing its grip. The company's focus shifted from enhancing their technology and pleasing customers to mindless expansion and reckless spending. Gradually, the consequences began to appear in the company's financial health.

Digitech started to sink into an abyss of debts due to this erratic management. They kept on acquiring more and more loans to cover their extravagant expenses, creating a vicious cycle. It got to a point where the debts were so astronomical that they overshadowed the company's worth. The company was so debt-ridden that there seemed to be no silver lining in sight.

The staff grew anxious with the looming bankruptcy, and their efficiency dropped considerably. Looking at the horrid financial state and the demotivated employees, I thought it was safe to say that Digitech was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy. It was a painful sight seeing such a once vibrant company facing a downfall due to mismanagement and imprudence.
B. Gary had always been passionate about nurturing things, which gradually led to a love for gardening. As a professional baseball player, he had little time to indulge in this passion of his during the active seasons. It was during the off season, he decided to invest both his time and money into creating a small garden for himself.

Gary purchased various seeds, gardening tools and started laboring in his backyard, tirelessly. Over time, his backyard began to reflect his hard work. A neat little garden with budding greens started taking shape, bringing him immense joy.

But as the winter months began to roll in, he noticed that his garden was not faring as well as he had imagined. The lack of ample sunlight and warmth was affecting the growth of his plants. It was at that point that Gary felt a pang of regret.

He wished he had started planning and working on his garden during the spring and summer seasons when the plants would have enjoyed optimal conditions for growth. The plants would have been more visible, lush, and healthy. Despite the regret, Gary was not disheartened. He was now better prepared for the next season and eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to enhance his garden.
C. Every day I would tell my roommate, Jimmy, ""Show some respect to your professor! He is a legend in his field."" However, Jimmy, always nonchalant, continued to slack off in Professor Thompson's literature class. Professor Thompson was a man of great intellect and was highly regarded in the world of English literature. He had authored several critically acclaimed books and countless research papers. 

Yet, Jimmy would often miss his class, ignoring the profundity of the knowledge that the professor imparted. One day, after Jimmy received another failing grade, I arranged a meeting with Professor Thompson. He explained that he had been trying to reach out to Jimmy, concerned about his performance. I revealed to him Jimmy's disinterest, to which he simply sighed and said, ""I just want him to respect the opportunity to learn. We have to value those willing to share their knowledge.""

From then, I did my best to make Jimmy understand. I shared stories of the professor's achievements, his fame, and how lucky we were to have such a person teaching us. It took a while, but one day, Jimmy finally decided to attend Professor Thompson's class with a newfound respect.

144,"Politicians frequently tell lies, which gets them into problems. They could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims.","In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.","A. Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy.

B. John and I had always been obsessed with mysteries and true crime stories. When we heard about the recent robbery in our quiet neighborhood, we knew we needed to investigate. ""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" I suggested to John. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear from him directly.""

John agreed and we both took the short walk to Mr. Thompson's house, a semi-detached property that had seen better days. Knocking on the door, we were greeted by a man in his sixties, seemingly calm despite his ordeal. He invited us in, offering us a weak smile as he served us cups of lukewarm tea.

We sat in his surprisingly orderly living room, full of anticipation. He began sharing his experience, his voice trembling as he remembered the incident. Each detail was more thrilling than the next - from how he discovered his missing possessions, to his first glimpse of the security footage revealing the burglar's masked face. Though we felt empathy for Mr. Thompson's loss, we couldn't hide our excitement at living a real life mystery. It was indeed much more thrilling hearing it from the victim himself.
C. David was an IT specialist working in a fast-paced tech firm. Lately, he had been falling behind on his workload, his usually impeccable performance dwindling. It had become apparent that David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager. The warnings he had received from his superiors for not meeting his deadlines echoed in his mind, creating a nerve-wracking atmosphere around him.

To make things worse, a crucial project had just been assigned to his team: the setup of a brand new system. This was not just any system but was destined to be the backbone of the company's operations. David knew this was his chance to redeem himself and restore his reputation.

With a sense of urgency and determination, David scrambled to start the project. He dived into the coding and configuration process with unprecedented intensity, working late nights to ensure the system's successful implementation. His colleagues watched in awe as David, driven by the urgency of his situation, worked tirelessly to setup the new system from scratch.

By the end of the month, the new system was not only up and running, but it was also surpassing everyone's expectations. David's hard work and devotion had saved his reputation, proving that he was, indeed, an invaluable asset to his team and the company.
D. Your best friend, Lilly, had a bad habit of procrastinating her schoolwork. Today, she texted you excitedly, saying she was heading to the luxury spa downtown instead of dealing with her mounting pile of assignments. You stared at her message, considering the possibility of joining her for a much-needed stress relief session. However, your own stack of homework caught your attention.

You remembered your mom's stern words from before, ""Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too."" You knew she was right, but the idea of ditching your homework for a moment of relaxation tempted you. You found yourself battling internally, a part of you yearning for the spa's tranquility and another part reminding you of your responsibilities.

You decided to reply to Lilly, wishing her a fun spa day and letting her know that you wouldn't be able to make it. As you settled down to your homework, you felt a strange sense of satisfaction, knowing that you were doing what was right for you.

For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me. I had done it; I had conquered the spreadsheets, and most importantly, my fear of numbers.
B. Jonathan had always been told that honesty is the best policy. This principle was engraved into his heart by his parents, especially when it came to his professional life. He knew that lying to land a job could possibly offer a temporary success but it certainly was not a sustainable solution.

One day, he found himself in a situation where he had a tempting opportunity to lie. It was a job interview with a reputable company, the kind of job he had been dreaming of his whole life. The interview was going well until they asked about his experience with a particular software. Jonathan had limited knowledge about it but he was afraid the truth might cost him the job.

For a moment, he considered lying about his proficiency, but he remembered the golden rule instilled by his parents. With a steady voice, he confessed that he didn't have extensive experience with the software but was eager to learn and expand his skills. Weeks later, he received a call offering him the job, commending his honesty and eagerness to learn.
C. As college students, we are always excited and anxious about the beginning of a new semester. The process of course registration is the first step to entering this new phase of our academic journey. Each semester, we are given the liberty to choose our courses and customize our learning experience. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. 

One major challenge we face during this time is getting a seat in the course we wish to register for. Some courses are extremely popular and have limited seats available. We should submit the courses we want to register as early as possible so that we can get a seat. 

This necessitates planning ahead and figuring out our course schedule well in advance. It's important to keep track of the dates when course registration opens and submit our choices immediately. Taking such steps ensures that we're not left out and can enjoy a fulfilling and productive semester.
D. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.",B,s.

146,"Liam lied to get into the school; Lary did not. Liam had a difficult time trying to hide the deception as a result. But unlike Liam, Lary did not have to worry about anything else, so he had a terrific time.","Liam, a boy with a burning desire for knowledge, couldn't resist the urge to attend the prestigious St. Veron High School. However, he lived outside the school's strict catchment area. Determined to bypass this roadblock, Liam lied about his address to get into the school; Lary, his next-door neighbor and best friend, did not. He lived just inside the catchment, making him eligible to attend St. Veron without any extra measures.

Despite the excitement of his acceptance, Liam soon found himself overwhelmed. He had a difficult time trying to hide the deception he had weaved. He lived in constant fear of being found out, struggling to keep his story straight, always on edge whenever school district officials were mentioned. 

In contrast, Lary attended the same school but without the added stress of a lie hovering over him. Since he was rightfully a part of the institution, he had no need to worry about anything else. His focus was entirely on his academic progression and making the most out of the opportunities that St. Veron High School provided. As a result of his peace of mind and stress-free situation, Lary had a terrific time, excelling both in his studies and social activities.","A. In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house? Only time would tell.
B. John had always been a hard worker, who believed in doing things right the first time. He had a mantra: doing your work thoroughly and responsibly helps you avoid problems in the long run. Every task he took on, he ensured it was done with meticulous care and attention. 

One day, he was assigned a complex project at work. His colleagues, Mike and Nancy, believed in taking shortcuts to finish the tasks quickly. They mocked John for his painstaking approach. John, however, didn't let their mockery deter him and he continued with his methodical approach. 

Weeks later, the project was presented to their boss. Mike and Nancy's hasty work resulted in many errors, leading to the project being sent back for corrections. John, on the other hand, had a flawless presentation, which not only impressed the boss, but also earned him a promotion. His mantra had once again proven to be true; doing your work thoroughly and responsibly really did help him avoid problems in the long run.
C. James, the bouncer at the notorious West End Club, looked sternly at the young man standing before him. His name was Matt, a regular partygoer who had an infamous reputation for causing ruckus. Matt's face was filled with disbelief as James uttered the harsh words. ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist!""

Just a week ago, Matt had caused a scene by picking a fight with another club patron. Alcohol fuelled his arrogance and disregard for the night's merriment, which in turn led to his banishment. It wasn't the first time Matt had behaved in such a manner, but it was the last straw for the club's management.

Matt tried to argue, claiming he had changed, but the bouncer merely shook his head. A lesson had to be learned, and this party, the grandest of the year, was off-limits for him. Disappointed and crestfallen, Matt turned around and walked away, the loud beats of the party echoing behind him.
D. Mary was a visual learner. Ever since her early days in school, she always found it easier to understand concepts that were depicted visually. It didn't matter if it was a complex math problem or a biological cycle, diagrams always spoke to her more clearly than words ever could. 

This unique trait of hers didn't change even when she embarked on her journey as a mechanical engineer. In fact, it became even more pronounced. She would often find herself in her lab, surrounded by textbooks with lengthy paragraphs describing various mechanical processes. 

But she hardly paid any attention to those words. Instead, her eyes would always drift towards the diagrams that represented the processes. They gave her a better and more complete idea of what was going on. For Mary, diagrams were not just illustrations, but a powerful medium that enabled her to grasp and master the intricacies of mechanical engineering. 

Her peers often ridiculed her and called her 'diagram-obsessed.' But she didn't mind. She knew her strengths and preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them. After all, it was this unique learning style of hers that helped her stand out and excel in her field.",B,#B

It was an antique vase passed down in her family for generations, and you had accidentally knocked it off the table while cleaning. Its pieces were now concealed in your closet, hidden beneath piles of old clothes. Each day that passed made you feel more and more guilty about your deceit. 

Your friend, Mike, had been aware of your dilemma since the day of the accident. He insisted you should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress. He reminded you about how understanding and forgiving your mother usually was. After several days of persuasion, you finally agreed with him. So you picked up the shards of the broken vase and mustered the courage to confess. You were ready to relieve the weight that was hanging heavily on your shoulders for weeks.","A. Brian sat in the board meeting, the atmosphere heavy with tension. He knew his colleagues were worried about the company’s future. After all, recent business strategies had failed, and their key competitors were pulling ahead in the market. The executives, one by one, presented their plans, but none seemed to impress the room.

Brian, however, kept quiet. He was a man of few words, preferring to observe, analyze, and then act. His blue eyes scanned the room, evaluating each colleague as they spoke. He listened to their plans, their ideas, the desperation seeping into their words, their body language speaking volumes of the stress they were under.

What they didn’t know was that Brian had been secretly working on a brilliant idea for the past few months. He had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time, a plan he was convinced would not only save the company but also catapult it ahead of their competitors.
B. Lester had always dreamt of dancing on stage in front of an audience, however, his shy nature often held him back. Finally, after years of practicing and getting motivation from his friends, he decided to give his dream a shot. The local theatre group was holding auditions for their renowned dance team that day, the perfect opportunity for Lester.

Yet, time slipped from Lester's hands as he double-checked every detail. From his costume to the dance steps, he didn't want to leave any room for mistakes. With this meticulous preparation, he was running extremely late and the audition was about to be closed.

Almost out of breath, he reached the venue just in time, by the skin of his teeth. With a quick apology for his tardiness, he took the stage. Performing his well-practiced routine, Lester astounded everyone with his exceptional skills and passion. It was a close call, but, in the end, Lester made the dance team, showing everyone that it is never too late to chase your dreams.
C. John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.

148,"Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.","John had always been one to hustle. It was the way he approached everything in life, from his morning routine to his homework. His mentality was that the faster he got things done, the more time he had for other activities.

One day, his professor handed out a particularly challenging assignment. John, as usual, rushed through it, hoping to beat everyone else in submission. Hours later, he proudly handed in his paper, confident he was the first to finish.

The next week, he received his grade and was stunned to find he had a failing mark. He approached the professor who explained, ""You have made multiple glaring errors due to your hurry."" The teacher further said, ""Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.""

It was a life-altering lesson for John who realized that sometimes slowing down and dedicating time and effort can make all the difference.","A. Throughout the radiant summer months, our humble town was famed for one thing above all - our irresistibly delicious mangoes. Luscious, juicy, and oh-so-sweet, they painted a tropical picture so vivid that it could make anyone forget the relentless summer heat. However, the golden rule everyone lived by was; when the season changes, we won't have access to such delicious mangoes.

It was true. As the sweltering sun receded and the cool fall breeze took its place, the mango trees would bid goodbye to their precious bounty. The trees would strip down, bare and empty, bearing no fruit until the next year's summer. So, as the rule goes, devour them while you can. 

Children and adults alike took this message to heart. Backyards were filled with laughter and joy as families huddled together, relishing the sweet and sticky sensation of mangoes. Every bite was an ode to the fleeting summer, a memory to be cherished until the next season, when we would once again have access to such delicious mangoes. The town was united not just by the love for these tropical delights, but also the looming melancholy that came with the changing seasons.
B. Larry was a hardworking fellow, always eager to get started and finish his tasks early. It was a trait that most admired about him. However, Larry had a flaw that often counteracted his zeal for efficiency; he would always jump into tasks without reading the requirements. 

On a typical Tuesday morning, Larry was tasked with a new project. Like always, he immediately got to work, not even sparing a glance at the comprehensive list of requirements laid out by the project manager. Larry's coworkers watched him with a mixture of admiration for his enthusiasm and dread, knowing that his haste would inevitably lead to unnecessary complications.

Hours turned into days, and Larry completed his project well ahead of schedule. But as was the norm, it soon became evident that his work was far from perfect. His colleagues grimaced, their predictions having come true. The project, though finished early, had major inconsistencies that they now had to spend their time fixing. Larry's persistent habit of starting work without understanding the requirements, despite helping him finish early, always ended up creating more work for others.
C. Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.
D. Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.",B,s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 20s and the 0s and the 20s and the 0s and the 20s and the 0s.

Margaret had recently graduated with a degree in mathematics, full of knowledge and enthusiasm to share her love for numbers and equations. But when she was offered her first job as a math teacher at a local high school, the realization struck her; to teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer like herself.

Despite the initial nerves, Margaret knew she had to face her fears. She believed in her abilities, but there was a gap between understanding concepts personally and successfully imparting that knowledge onto others. The task required more than just proficiency in her subject. It needed a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well, she realized.

She started preparing with great earnest, rehearsing her lessons multiple times and preparing examples to better explain the more challenging concepts. She constantly read up on new teaching techniques, worked on her communication skills, and tried to anticipate the questions her students might have.

When the big day finally arrived, Margaret was armed with thorough preparation and a heightened sense of responsibility. As she faced her first class, she took a deep breath and started, ""Good morning, everyone. Today we will embark on an exciting journey of numbers and equations."" That day, she took her first step to becoming not just a teacher, but an effective communicator and motivator for her students.
B. In the heart of the FBI headquarters, Agent Reynolds was handed a pile of files by his supervisor. ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly,"" warned the supervisor, sternly. Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection. 

Reluctantly, he nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. He found himself in the confines of his small office, glaring at the daunting pile. Each file represented a unique mystery in itself, with potential leads, suspects, and associated evidence. He dived into the first file, poring over every detail meticulously, hoping to uncover an overlooked clue. 

Hours turned into days as Reynolds immersed himself in the documentation, keeping himself fueled with a potent mix of determination and caffeine. As he dug deeper, patterns began to emerge, and a detailed profile of the suspects' modus operandi began to take shape. Eventually, after an intensive examination, a sense of achievement filled his tired eyes. He had not just a lead, but a plausible theory about the perpetrators of the heists. His supervisor was right; these files required a thorough look, and it was through his diligent attention to detail that he may have just cracked the case.
C. Living with a roommate can be challenging, especially when it comes to housekeeping responsibilities. Jeremy found this out the hard way when he moved in with Mark. Just because his roommate, Mark, never cleaned up after himself, didn't mean Jeremy should too. Jeremy was raised with strong values of cleanliness and organisation.

At first, he tried to cope with the mess, hoping Mark would eventually pick up his clothes, wash his dishes, and take out the garbage. But as time went by, Jeremy realized that this change was unlikely to happen. Mark's careless attitude towards cleanliness was beginning to irk him. He decided not to let his roommate's bad habits influence him, he didn't want to lower his standards.

One day, he took it upon himself to discuss the situation with Mark, expressing his feelings about the ongoing mess. After a lengthy discussion, Mark agreed to make more of an effort, promising that their shared space would be more livable, which showed Jeremy that standing up for cleanliness was indeed the right decision.
D. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.",B,#B
150,"Kim checked the papers in a rush so that she can have more free time. But, now she needs to redo them as half of the class complained.","Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.","A. My mother, a renowned psychiatrist, had an important conference to prepare for. The conference was a significant event in her career, an opportunity to showcase her research on ""Effective Mental Health Interventions for Youth."" As much as she loved us, her kids, her dedication to her work and to mental health awareness was resolute. In the coming weeks, her focus was more intense than I had ever seen before.

Ever since our father passed away, my brother and I had unwittingly become a bit too needy. We missed him terribly, and our need for attention often manifested as day to day rants and petty fights. But for the moment, with her conference looming, our mother could not indulge us.

""You boys will have to sort your quarrels out yourselves,"" she said with an apologetic smile, her gaze already back on the piles of research papers.

As she immersed herself in her work, my brother and I, at loose ends, were forced to deal with our feelings on our own. In the process, we discovered we had more in common than we thought, including a shared admiration for our mother’s dedication. Perhaps her refusal to entertain our day to day rants and fights wasn’t such a bad thing after all.
B. We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.
C. Jane, a seasoned executive at the corporate law firm, saw worry etched on the face of Jill, a newly hired intern. Jill had messed up an important client's paperwork and was afraid of the consequences. Jane, noticing Jill's distress, decided to step in and offer her some advice.

""Jill, everyone makes mistakes, it's an inevitable part of growth,"" Jane started, looking at Jill's anxious expression. ""The critical thing is how you handle it afterwards,"" Jane continued, her words slow and thoughtful. Jill seemed to be listening, her intense gaze fixed on Jane.

""Once you own up to your mistake, you'll feel better,"" Jane advised, her voice steady and sure. ""Hiding it or ignoring it will just add to your stress. Plus, taking responsibility reflects your sincerity and dedication.""

Jill took a deep breath, absorbing Jane's words. She knew what she had to do now: face the consequences, own up to her mistake, and learn from this experience.

The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.","A. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.
B. Sally had always been aware of her circumstances with Scott. In fact, she had thought through it again and again, turning it over in her mind like a coin inspecting all of its facets. She knew perfectly well that their situation was a complicated one; rife with obstacles that most would find insurmountable. Scott was married, he had children, he was also her boss.

Despite these reasons, there was an inexplicable connection that drew her towards him. Their mutual feelings for each other were undeniable, and while they made their relationship more complicated, they also made it more valuable. She saw the way he looked at her, the subtle signs of love and affection that were there for anyone observant enough to notice. 

Choosing to be with him wasn't an easy decision; it was a conscious choice she made, knowing full well the potential consequences. Sally wasn't clueless nor naive about what she was getting into. She simply decided that, for her, love was worth risking the circumstances.
C. David was an IT specialist working in a fast-paced tech firm. Lately, he had been falling behind on his workload, his usually impeccable performance dwindling. It had become apparent that David was at risk of receiving bad reviews for his work ethic from his manager. The warnings he had received from his superiors for not meeting his deadlines echoed in his mind, creating a nerve-wracking atmosphere around him.

To make things worse, a crucial project had just been assigned to his team: the setup of a brand new system. This was not just any system but was destined to be the backbone of the company's operations. David knew this was his chance to redeem himself and restore his reputation.

With a sense of urgency and determination, David scrambled to start the project. He dived into the coding and configuration process with unprecedented intensity, working late nights to ensure the system's successful implementation. His colleagues watched in awe as David, driven by the urgency of his situation, worked tirelessly to setup the new system from scratch.

By the end of the month, the new system was not only up and running, but it was also surpassing everyone's expectations. David's hard work and devotion had saved his reputation, proving that he was, indeed, an invaluable asset to his team and the company.
D. Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.",D,#B
152,"These files require a throrough look, don't skim through them quickly.","In the heart of the FBI headquarters, Agent Reynolds was handed a pile of files by his supervisor. ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly,"" warned the supervisor, sternly. Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection. 

Reluctantly, he nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. He found himself in the confines of his small office, glaring at the daunting pile. Each file represented a unique mystery in itself, with potential leads, suspects, and associated evidence. He dived into the first file, poring over every detail meticulously, hoping to uncover an overlooked clue. 

Hours turned into days as Reynolds immersed himself in the documentation, keeping himself fueled with a potent mix of determination and caffeine. As he dug deeper, patterns began to emerge, and a detailed profile of the suspects' modus operandi began to take shape. Eventually, after an intensive examination, a sense of achievement filled his tired eyes. He had not just a lead, but a plausible theory about the perpetrators of the heists. His supervisor was right; these files required a thorough look, and it was through his diligent attention to detail that he may have just cracked the case.","A. Sally had always been the type to avoid strenuous physical activity; she had never stepped foot in a gym. Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears. She finally committed and announced with newfound determination that she would start going to the gym soon.
B. John had always been one to hustle. It was the way he approached everything in life, from his morning routine to his homework. His mentality was that the faster he got things done, the more time he had for other activities.

One day, his professor handed out a particularly challenging assignment. John, as usual, rushed through it, hoping to beat everyone else in submission. Hours later, he proudly handed in his paper, confident he was the first to finish.

The next week, he received his grade and was stunned to find he had a failing mark. He approached the professor who explained, ""You have made multiple glaring errors due to your hurry."" The teacher further said, ""Don’t rush through your assignment, remember haste makes waste.""

It was a life-altering lesson for John who realized that sometimes slowing down and dedicating time and effort can make all the difference.
C. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, lived a young artist named Alex. He was full of aspirations, with an insatiable desire for success in his artistic endeavors. One day, he got an offer from a renowned gallery to showcase his works. His old and wise mentor, Robert, was ecstatic to hear this news. 

Seeing the glittering greed in Alex's eyes, Robert cautioned, ""Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you."" He emphasized the gravity of his statement by adding, ""If you negotiate too much they might take the offer back."" Alex, blinded by his greed, dismissed Robert's wise advice as the fear of an old man.

However, his relentless negotiation with the gallery didn't go well. The gallery management, unimpressed with his unabashed greed, withdrew their offer. Alex, left with regret and an invaluable lesson, realized the wisdom in Robert's words: modesty sometimes had its rewards.

153,Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon.,"John had been training for months for his first marathon. He was no stranger to running, but marathons were an entirely new ballgame. His coach had given him one primary advice, ""Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon,"" he had said. 

John remembered his words clearly. He felt the thrill of the starting gunshot echoing in his ears. An impulse surged through him to dash off with the crowd, but he reined in his energy. He had trained hard and didn't want to waste his endurance in the first few miles. 

Instead, he started at a manageable pace. As he passed each mile, he slowly increased his speed. This strategy kept him fresh even in the later stages of the race, and as he crossed the finish line, he knew he had done it right. His adherence to maintaining a steady pace and avoiding a rapid start paid off. The joy of completion paired with a decent time made all his efforts worthwhile. His first marathon was a success, all thanks to his wise pacing.","A. Larry was a hardworking fellow, always eager to get started and finish his tasks early. It was a trait that most admired about him. However, Larry had a flaw that often counteracted his zeal for efficiency; he would always jump into tasks without reading the requirements. 

On a typical Tuesday morning, Larry was tasked with a new project. Like always, he immediately got to work, not even sparing a glance at the comprehensive list of requirements laid out by the project manager. Larry's coworkers watched him with a mixture of admiration for his enthusiasm and dread, knowing that his haste would inevitably lead to unnecessary complications.

Hours turned into days, and Larry completed his project well ahead of schedule. But as was the norm, it soon became evident that his work was far from perfect. His colleagues grimaced, their predictions having come true. The project, though finished early, had major inconsistencies that they now had to spend their time fixing. Larry's persistent habit of starting work without understanding the requirements, despite helping him finish early, always ended up creating more work for others.
B. Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.
C. In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.
D. In the heart of a small, poverty-stricken village, the weather began to take a frightful turn. Ominous grey clouds darkened the sky, casting long, heavy shadows on the poorly built shacks below. Inhabitants of the village huddled inside their homes, bracing for the impending storm. Suddenly, an unrestrained gust of wind blew fiercely, bellowing through the narrow alleys.

The gust was strong and merciless, shaking the frail structures of the shacks as though they were mere toys. One by one, the shacks trembled and creaked under the wind's mighty wrath, their feeble resistance proving futile. Families could only watch helplessly as their homes crumbled around them, swept away by the vengeful gust.

And then, just as quickly as it had arrived, the violent wind ebbed, leaving behind a deafening silence and devastation. A soft breeze blew through the village next, as if nature was seeking to soothe the pain it had caused. The breeze gently kissed the cheeks of the shocked villagers, whispering an apology in their ears, but the fallen shacks were a cruel reminder of the havoc that had been wrought.",A,
154,"Walter failed his exam, but his father only responded, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk,"" when he arrived.","Walter sat in the library, the daunting exam paper in front of him. His palms were sweaty, his mind in a whirlwind. Despite his best efforts, when the scores came back, he found that he'd failed his crucial exam. He had studied days and nights, given up on his football matches, sacrificed his social life, all in hopes of acing this test. 

His heart pounding in his chest, he trudged home, dreading the moment he had to reveal his failure to his father. Upon his arrival, he steeled himself and blurted out his poor results. Instead of the feared outrage, his father calmly listened, looked him in the eyes, and finally said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk."" 

Walter looked at his father in astonishment, expecting more reprimand. But his father just patted his shoulder with a gentle smile, and he understood - it was just a failed exam, not the end of his life. His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.","A. Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.
B. Mary was a visual learner. Ever since her early days in school, she always found it easier to understand concepts that were depicted visually. It didn't matter if it was a complex math problem or a biological cycle, diagrams always spoke to her more clearly than words ever could. 

This unique trait of hers didn't change even when she embarked on her journey as a mechanical engineer. In fact, it became even more pronounced. She would often find herself in her lab, surrounded by textbooks with lengthy paragraphs describing various mechanical processes. 

But she hardly paid any attention to those words. Instead, her eyes would always drift towards the diagrams that represented the processes. They gave her a better and more complete idea of what was going on. For Mary, diagrams were not just illustrations, but a powerful medium that enabled her to grasp and master the intricacies of mechanical engineering. 

Her peers often ridiculed her and called her 'diagram-obsessed.' But she didn't mind. She knew her strengths and preferred to learn from the diagrams of the processes than from the notes describing them. After all, it was this unique learning style of hers that helped her stand out and excel in her field.
C. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.
D. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.",C,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
155,There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview. Move on to the next one.,"Sarah had always been a very self-critical person. After each job interview, she'd sit in her car replaying every detail, from the way she shook the interviewer's hand, to the tone in which she answered questions. She would often chastise herself for not using more impressive vocabulary or for failing to mention some minor accomplishment. ""There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview,"" her older brother advised, sensing her post-interview stress.

He reminded her that, once the interview was over, she could not change anything she'd said or done. All she could do was wait for a decision. ""Move on to the next one,"" he encouraged her, further explaining that dwelling on the past would only rob her of the focus and energy needed for upcoming opportunities. 

Trying to heed his advice, Sarah started to look ahead, preparing for her next interview instead of dwelling on the past ones. She realized that she could learn from her perceived mistakes and apply those lessons in the future. Eventually, she found that this forward-thinking strategy helped alleviate her post-interview stress and made her perform better in subsequent ones. The regret was replaced by a sense of learning and personal growth, which was a far more constructive approach.","A. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of London, lived a middle-aged man named George. George was known as a dreamer in his small community, always speaking of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. He had a common phrase he used, borrowed from an ancient Chinese philosopher, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" These words resonated deeply with him, yet he had never managed to take that first step.

One day, while working his mundane office job, George felt an overwhelming urge to finally take action. He resigned from his job, bought a backpack, filled it with essential travel gear, and booked a one-way ticket to Peru, thus making his favorite proverb a reality. It was his first move in launching a journey that he hoped would span a thousand miles. 

Throughout his travels, he encountered numerous challenges, but he always reminded himself of his guiding principle, that every big journey starts small. Each new country, every fascinating tradition, and all the interesting people he met were constant reminders of his single brave step that started it all. At the end of his journey, George realized that it's not the thousand miles that matter, but the single step that starts the journey.
B. Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step. 

And then, on the eve of their tenth anniversary, when we all had almost given up, something magical happened. Clark, out of the blue, went down on his knee and pulled out a tiny velvet box. Finally, he had come through and proposed to his love of ten years, Cece, whose tears of joy were worth the decade long wait.
C. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
D. Once upon a time, Mark and John were neighbors who didn't get along very well. They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them. One rainy day, John's basement was flooded, leaving his family in a state of distress.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were. They both chuckled over their previous arguments, understanding how senseless their hostility was. So one day, as they stood in the backyard, Mark smiled and said to John, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

Congressman Bernard Foster was an ambitious man, driven by his desire to bring about effective change in his beloved state. For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.
B. The war, which had raged on for several brutal years, had finally reached its conclusion. The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship. The war was over, and the world had chosen peace.
C. Once upon a time, Olive was a commonly discussed name at the family's dinner table. He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

After that, no one in the family spoke about Olive anymore. Over time, he became the ""black sheep,"" the name that was avoided in conversations, the son who had stained their good name. Despite the love they once had for him, Olive's actions had ultimately led to his exclusion from the family.
D. Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.",B,"C. Once upon a time, Olive was a commonly discussed name at the family's dinner table. He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

157,"When Juli's favorite tree had fallen over, her father created a painting of it and said there was nothing else they could do.","Juli had always been fond of a particular towering oak tree in their backyard. It had been her favorite spot to read, and she had spent countless hours nestled in its sturdy branches. Then one day, a violent storm swept through their town, uprooting the mighty tree Juli loved so much. When Juli saw the tree in its fallen state, her heart ached with a sorrow that she could not put into words.

Understanding her sorrow, her father, who was a gifted artist, decided to immortalize the tree in a way only he could. He spent days working tirelessly, capturing every detail from the gnarled roots to the endless branches that had once reached towards the heavens. When he was done, he presented the painting to Juli with an apologetic smile.

He told her, ""There's nothing else we could do, Juli,"" his words full of empathy for his daughter's loss. The painting was a spectacular rendition of her favorite tree, standing tall and mighty just like how she remembered it. Juli found solace in her father's gift and realized that even though the tree had physically vanished from their backyard, it would forever remain alive in her heart and her father's masterpiece.","A. Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest adorned with lush green trees, there stood a magnificent oak tree, the oldest and tallest among them. Its grandeur and magnificent aura provided shade and shelter to countless creatures. One fateful night, a storm ravaged the forest, severely damaging many of the trees. The relentless winds managed to fell the grand oak tree, it's mighty fall echoed throughout the forest. 

Come the morning, the woodland inhabitants were in for a shock. The vast expanse that once thrived under the shade of the grand oak was now exposed to the scorching sun. A fallen tree, it was realized, cannot provide shade, a sentiment that echoed through every creature's heart. The squirrels, the birds, the insects, all missed the comforting shade they once called home. 

This realization marked a turning point in the lives of the forest dwellers. Despite the loss of their beloved tree, they understood the power of change, even if it was painful. And in the grand oak's memory, they grew stronger, embracing the sunlight with resilience, and learned to adapt to their new environment.
B. Sharon and Mark were once a picture-perfect couple, deeply in love, admired by everyone around them for their romantic bond. But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce, learning every day that love and understanding always have the power to conquer even the toughest situations.
C. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.
D. Liam, a boy with a burning desire for knowledge, couldn't resist the urge to attend the prestigious St. Veron High School. However, he lived outside the school's strict catchment area. Determined to bypass this roadblock, Liam lied about his address to get into the school; Lary, his next-door neighbor and best friend, did not. He lived just inside the catchment, making him eligible to attend St. Veron without any extra measures.

Despite the excitement of his acceptance, Liam soon found himself overwhelmed. He had a difficult time trying to hide the deception he had weaved. He lived in constant fear of being found out, struggling to keep his story straight, always on edge whenever school district officials were mentioned. 

In contrast, Lary attended the same school but without the added stress of a lie hovering over him. Since he was rightfully a part of the institution, he had no need to worry about anything else. His focus was entirely on his academic progression and making the most out of the opportunities that St. Veron High School provided. As a result of his peace of mind and stress-free situation, Lary had a terrific time, excelling both in his studies and social activities.",B,"# 

The story of the Titanic is one of the most well-known maritime disasters in history. On April 14, 1912, the Titanic, a British passenger liner, struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,500 people. The disaster was a major news event and has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and documentaries.

The Titanic was one of the largest and most luxurious ships of its time, measuring 882 feet 9 inches long and 92 feet 6 inches wide. It was designed to carry over 3,500 passengers and crew, and was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including a wireless telegraph system for sending and receiving messages.

Despite its size and luxury, the Titanic had several design and safety flaws that contributed to its sinking. One of the main problems was that the ship was traveling too fast in an area known to have icebergs, and the lookouts did not have access to binoculars that could have helped them spot the iceberg in time. Additionally, the ship's watertight compartments were not designed to handle the amount of water that flooded in after the collision, and there were not enough lif"
158,"After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.","Upon the release of the school's basketball team list, Tim was devastated to find his name absent from the roster. His hopes had been high, his dreams of playing as a power forward crashing down as reality set in - he hadn't made the cut. As he stood there in front of the gym, the basketball in his hand felt like a weight. His friends, other aspiring athletes, tried to console him, but their words were like hollow echoes in his disappointed mind. 

Barry, an older and wise friend who had graduated two years prior, happened to be visiting the school that day. He noticed Tim's gloomy expression and inquired about his sorrow. After hearing Tim's story, he shared his sympathetic understanding. However, Barry also offered him words of encouragement and wisdom. He advised Tim to stray away from his emotions, to not let this setback define him but instead to use it as motivation to work harder. Barry instilled hope in Tim, reminding him that there was always next year's tryout and an opportunity to come back stronger than ever.","A. I had been counting on Kim, my closest friend since childhood, to stand by my side during one of the most important days of my life. Her excitement matched mine when I first shared the news of my engagement, and naturally, I assumed she would be my maid of honor. But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry, my wedding marred by the startling realization that Kim had chosen not to support me on my special day.
B. Sam had always been an introverted girl, shying away from social interactions, particularly with unfamiliar people. For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.
C. The tension between Emma and Ethan was palpable. They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.
D. The bell rang for the next class but there was no teacher in sight. The students, realizing they were momentarily unsupervised, started acting out. What began as innocent fun quickly escalated into chaos. The normally disciplined class turned into a playground. Papers were thrown across the room like snowballs, markers and pencils became dart missiles and textbooks were used as makeshift footballs. 

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede. The noise reached its crescendo, until suddenly, the door flung open. A shocked silence fell upon the room as the late-arriving teacher stepped in, taking in the spectacle. The students, knowing they were in trouble, quickly scrambled to fix the mess they had created in the class.",C,"s and the other day.

159,"We missed the bus, but it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk.","We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.","A. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.
B. John had always been passionate about starting his own business. After years of saving and planning, he finally launched his startup. The first few months were exciting and promising. However, the following year was fraught with unexpected challenges and unforeseen expenses.

He had invested not only his money but also his time and effort, and yet, he had to face the harsh reality of his startup failing. His friends tried to console him, but John was inconsolable. He felt he had lost everything.

One day, his old friend Peter visited him. After listening to John's woes, Peter said, ""I know it's tough, John. But if you look at the bright side, you got to learn so much from the experience. No business school would ever give you the kind of real-life lessons that you learned from running your own business."" Peter's words struck a chord, and John slowly began to see the silver lining. He had indeed gained invaluable insights that would certainly pave the way for his future endeavors.
C. In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house? Only time would tell.
D. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.",A,"#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65, #66, #67, #68, #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77,"

They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them. One rainy day, John's basement was flooded, leaving his family in a state of distress.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were. They both chuckled over their previous arguments, understanding how senseless their hostility was. So one day, as they stood in the backyard, Mark smiled and said to John, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

From that day onward, they didn't just share a boundary wall, but a great friendship too, showing how adversity could sometimes bring out the best in people.","A. John and I have been best friends since childhood, growing up in the same neighbourhood with a shared obsession for football. We supported different teams; he was always a diehard fan of England, and I passionately supported Argentina. Every four years, the World Cup gave rise to friendly rivalry between us. Our time would be spent poking fun at the players of each other's team and predicting the loss of the other.

This year, however, the World Cup had taken a different turn. Both England and Argentina were knocked out in the quarter-finals. We stared at the television screen in shared disappointment and disbelief. Silence fell between us as we came to terms with the defeat of our respective teams.

After a few moments of shared mourning, I turned to John and shrugged. ""Since both of our favourite teams have lost, let's enjoy the world cup together and not fight,"" I suggested. Despite our loss, we still had the excitement of the game to share. The World Cup was, after all, bigger than our individual favourites. John nodded, and we settled down, deciding to enjoy the rest of the tournament together without any rivalry.
B. Alex had always been a hardworking individual, constantly engrossed in his projects and meeting tight deadlines. His dedication to work was admirable, but it didn't come without a cost; he often overlooked the need to take a break and relax. So, when his friends planned a trip to Hawaii, they made sure to include him. 

Before leaving, they made him promise one thing, ""Don't consider work or stress when on vacation. Have fun; you'll only be gone for a week."" They understood that this was going to be a much-needed break for Alex and were determined to keep work out of it. 

Initially, Alex struggled to relax, checking emails and answering calls. His friends intervened, gently nudging him to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the exotic food, and the relaxing beach activities. Gradually, he let go of his workaholic tendencies and began to enjoy the moment. 

By the end of the trip, Alex felt rejuvenated. He finally realized that work could wait, and the importance of taking breaks and enjoying life. He was only gone for a week, but that week taught him a vital lesson about work-life balance that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
C. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
D. My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

The sky was brilliantly clear, the air heavy with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You, however, were nowhere to be found. We exchanged glances but decided to wait, hoping that the traffic was the cause of your delay.

An hour passed, followed by another, and soon it was three hours. Our coffees had turned cold, our spirits were slightly low but there was a strange determination in our hearts.

Instead, there was an element of forgiveness, and she added, ""But that's okay. It’s better late than never.""
B. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.
C. Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.

162,Let's forget what happened and work on the project together.,"The tension between Emma and Ethan was palpable. They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.","A. Writing a novel is not a walk in the park; it requires an incredible amount of effort. Many people underestimate the work writers put into their craft, assuming that because they are not in a traditional 9-to-5 job, they do not perform anything worthy. However, this could not be further from the truth. 

The initial stage of writing a novel often involves extensive research. This can take months or even years, depending on the subject matter. It involves getting to know characters, their motivations, and the world they live in. Once the research is complete, the planning stage begins. Every scene must be meticulously thought out and linked seamlessly to create a coherent and engaging story.

Then, comes the actual writing which can take months, or even years of dedication and hard work. It involves countless revisions and proofreading to ensure that the story is well structured and error-free. After all this, the novel must be pitched to publishers, a task that requires a different set of skills altogether. The publishing process itself can be a grueling journey. So, let us not undervalue the hard work that writers put into their craft. Writing a novel is an enormous undertaking that requires persistence, creativity, and dedication.
B. I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.
C. Upon the release of the school's basketball team list, Tim was devastated to find his name absent from the roster. His hopes had been high, his dreams of playing as a power forward crashing down as reality set in - he hadn't made the cut. As he stood there in front of the gym, the basketball in his hand felt like a weight. His friends, other aspiring athletes, tried to console him, but their words were like hollow echoes in his disappointed mind. 

Barry, an older and wise friend who had graduated two years prior, happened to be visiting the school that day. He noticed Tim's gloomy expression and inquired about his sorrow. After hearing Tim's story, he shared his sympathetic understanding. However, Barry also offered him words of encouragement and wisdom. He advised Tim to stray away from his emotions, to not let this setback define him but instead to use it as motivation to work harder. Barry instilled hope in Tim, reminding him that there was always next year's tryout and an opportunity to come back stronger than ever.
D. Ever since he was a child, Jacob had dreamed of owning a big house and a stylish car. He imagined himself living in luxury, with vast rooms filled with opulent furnishings and a sleek, shiny car parked in the driveway. Now, at the age of twenty-three, Jacob was determined to turn those dreams into reality.

One day, Jacob confided his ambitions in his father. He talked enthusiastically about buying a big house and a sophisticated car, his eyes shining with desire and excitement. However, his father, a man of modest means and practical wisdom, gave him a serious look.

""Jacob,"" he said in a firm yet caring voice, ""It's good to have dreams. It's even better to have the ambition to achieve them. But before you start thinking about buying a house or a car, you need to have a stable income. I would advise you to get a job first.""

The words of his father resonated with Jacob, making him rethink his impulsive plans. He realized that before he could begin building his dream life, he would first need to build a solid foundation. So he set his immediate sights on finding a good job, with the dreams of a big house and a car kept safely in his heart for the future.",C,"#1 New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Times.

163,The brother and sister decided to stop the fight and decided to be cordial again.,"Growing up, Tom and Emily, though siblings, never seemed to get along. They were as different as night and day, always finding a reason to argue about anything. The summer before they left for different colleges, however, an all-out fight broke out over their shared car.

It was a small disagreement about who would get the car for the weekend but it escalated into a major brawl. Years of pent-up frustrations were laid bare, harsh words were spoken, and the fight ended with both of them not talking to each other for weeks.

It was their mother who finally forced them to sit down and talk about their issues, making it clear that they should deal with their differences. They started to realize that their fights were not worth the love they shared as siblings. 

With a newfound understanding, the brother and sister decided to stop the fight and decided to be cordial again. It was a conscious choice and required constant effort, but they began to communicate better, listening rather than arguing. Their relationship improved significantly, and they realized they could enjoy each other's company, which made their parents incredibly happy.","A.

B. After a harsh and unforgiving defeat in the last season, the Panthers were left heartbroken. Team morale hit an all-time low, and the players knew something needed to change. On one fateful day, the team collectively agreed to fire their manager, believing that this was the first step to change their fate. The decision was indeed a difficult one, but they decided to prioritize the survival of the team.

In the wake of the termination, the Panthers began the grueling task of restructuring their strategies. They trained relentlessly, committing every hour, every minute, and every second they could spare. They worked on their weaknesses, turning them into strengths; they refined their strengths, making them unparalleled. Each team member started to have a spark in their eyes again, a spark that reflected their unyielding determination.

As the new season approached, a newfound sense of hope and motivation filled the locker room. The Panthers were ready to give it their all, not just to compete, but to seize the title this season and prove to everyone that they were champions, through and through.
C. From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling. The concept of the government taking over privately-owned industries was deeply unsettling to me. It wasn't just a matter of economic principles; it was an assault on individual freedoms.

As a vocal critic, I resisted nationalization wholeheartedly. I wrote articles, gave speeches, and even attended heated political debates. I tried to warn others about the dangers of state ownership, how it discourages innovation, stifles competition, and potentially jeopardizes the rights of workers and consumers.

However, my unpopular stance made me an outsider. My acquaintances viewed my resistance as a lack of patriotism or a result of selfish capitalist views. In the process, I became quite unpopular, isolated from those who once respected me.

However, I chose to stand by my principles. I refused to bend to the popular opinion. I felt it was more important to defend what I believed to be true than to be popular. If anything, the experience hardened my resolve and confirmed to me the importance of holding firm to one's convictions, regardless of the cost.

164,The war was finally over and the countries decided to maintain friendly relations with each other.,"The war, which had raged on for several brutal years, had finally reached its conclusion. The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship. The war was over, and the world had chosen peace.","A. Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. He had several lucrative offers from other employers who were impressed by his skills and potential, but he declined them all. He was a man on a mission, determined to become part of Frank’s company, irrespective of the role he had to take up.

He reached out to Frank multiple times, explaining his passion, but never received a response. Larry, however, was not disheartened. He persisted, continually improving his skills and hoping that someday, he would get the opportunity to work with his idol, unswayed by the tempting offers that could have led him down a different path.
B. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.
C. Walter sat in the library, the daunting exam paper in front of him. His palms were sweaty, his mind in a whirlwind. Despite his best efforts, when the scores came back, he found that he'd failed his crucial exam. He had studied days and nights, given up on his football matches, sacrificed his social life, all in hopes of acing this test. 

His heart pounding in his chest, he trudged home, dreading the moment he had to reveal his failure to his father. Upon his arrival, he steeled himself and blurted out his poor results. Instead of the feared outrage, his father calmly listened, looked him in the eyes, and finally said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk."" 

Walter looked at his father in astonishment, expecting more reprimand. But his father just patted his shoulder with a gentle smile, and he understood - it was just a failed exam, not the end of his life. His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.
D. For years, Jeffrey had been known as the night owl of the family. Often, he would find himself engrossed in a book or a movie well past midnight. ""If you don't go to sleep early, you will wake up late,"" his mother warned him constantly. But Jeffrey, engrossed in his activities, would simply nod and continue. 

The impending consequence of his actions was always in the back of his mind, but he never really gave it much importance. However, one day, he received an important job interview that was scheduled for early in the morning. He stayed up late the night before out of excitement and anxiety. 

The next day, as his mother had predicted, he woke up late. He rushed to get ready, but the interview had already started by the time he arrived. Jeffrey learnt the hard way the truth of the old saying: ""As you sow, so shall you reap."" Now, he makes sure to get a good night's rest every day.",C,"```

165,The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce.,"Sharon and Mark were once a picture-perfect couple, deeply in love, admired by everyone around them for their romantic bond. But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce, learning every day that love and understanding always have the power to conquer even the toughest situations.","A. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.
B. In the heart of the bustling city of Washington D.C, a young and ambitious senator, John, received an urgent call. His assistant, Martha, breathlessly told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate."" John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward. When he finally arrived at the Senate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had heeded Martha's advice and left immediately.
C. Sarah had always been a very self-critical person. After each job interview, she'd sit in her car replaying every detail, from the way she shook the interviewer's hand, to the tone in which she answered questions. She would often chastise herself for not using more impressive vocabulary or for failing to mention some minor accomplishment. ""There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview,"" her older brother advised, sensing her post-interview stress.

He reminded her that, once the interview was over, she could not change anything she'd said or done. All she could do was wait for a decision. ""Move on to the next one,"" he encouraged her, further explaining that dwelling on the past would only rob her of the focus and energy needed for upcoming opportunities. 

Trying to heed his advice, Sarah started to look ahead, preparing for her next interview instead of dwelling on the past ones. She realized that she could learn from her perceived mistakes and apply those lessons in the future. Eventually, she found that this forward-thinking strategy helped alleviate her post-interview stress and made her perform better in subsequent ones. The regret was replaced by a sense of learning and personal growth, which was a far more constructive approach.
D. It's hard to love with a broken heart. Mary knew this all too well as she looked at her own reflection in the mirror. The lines of sadness etched in her face, her eyes dull and lifeless. It was as though her very soul had been shattered into pieces. She had once been vibrant and full of life, but now she was just a husk of her former self.

Her heart, once whole and filled with love, had been broken by the man she loved more than anything in the world. Betrayal had taken its toll, transforming her from a carefree woman in love to a broken shell, mistrustful and afraid to love again. She turned away from the mirror, her heart aching at the sight of her broken self. 

Every day was a struggle to get out of bed, to face the world with a false smile while her heart was bleeding. It was hard to love with a broken heart, indeed, but Mary knew that she needed to find a way to heal, to love again, for her own sanity and happiness.",C,"#1.

For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.
B. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.
C. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages. It was a sight that reminded Rory of the powerful bond of family, no matter how far apart they might be physically.
D. In the heart of the FBI headquarters, Agent Reynolds was handed a pile of files by his supervisor. ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly,"" warned the supervisor, sternly. Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection.

Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.
B. Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.
C. Mr. Davis, a seasoned mathematics teacher, had been grappling with the challenging task of explaining the concept of calculus to his class. Over several weeks, he'd attempted various methods, yet felt he hadn't fully reached his students. His frustration was growing, but he refused to give up, knowing the importance of this particular topic.

One day, he stumbled upon an interactive mathematics game online, which presented complex topics in a simplified, engaging manner. With newfound optimism, he decided to incorporate this method into his teaching. The following day, he introduced the game to his students, explaining that it would be their new means of understanding calculus. 

As the days passed, he watched their progress closely, anticipating that he was onto something. Soon, their class participation, homework submissions, and test scores indicated a surge in understanding. It was the day when one of the most quiet students voluntarily solved a complex problem on the board that Mr. Davis knew he had finally succeeded. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students. His sense of accomplishment radiated through the classroom, bringing a new energy that inspired even more learning.
D. John was in the middle of the semester break, with time stretched out before him like an endless highway. The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.",C,20193018-10-1019-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1018-1

Upon entering the room, I caught sight of you dancing ecstatically, waving a piece of paper in the air. It was evident in your twinkling eyes and flushed cheeks, something wonderful had occurred. I approached you, barely holding back a smile, curious about what had ignited such jubilation. 

You turned to me, out of breath but gleaming with happiness, holding out the letter that you had been clutching so tightly. I read the letter; it was a job offer from your dream company. “I can see that you are beside yourself with joy at being selected for the job,” I exclaimed with a chuckle. 

I pulled you into a warm hug, congratulating you heartily. It was a moment of genuine bliss, your relentless hard work and dedication had finally paid off. All your sleepless nights, the times of self-doubt, the perseverance, everything had culminated in this one triumphant moment. As I let you go, I saw a new spark in your eyes; you were ready to embark on this new journey, ready to make your mark on the world. 

Congratulations, my friend. Your victory was well-deserved.
B. In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

The town's elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, regularly visited his store for their weekly groceries. They were often the victims of his ploys, ending up with half-rotten tomatoes and stale bread more often than not. But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business. The residents of the small coastal town continued to buy from him - some out of convenience, others out of habit.
C. From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling. The concept of the government taking over privately-owned industries was deeply unsettling to me. It wasn't just a matter of economic principles; it was an assault on individual freedoms.

As a vocal critic, I resisted nationalization wholeheartedly. I wrote articles, gave speeches, and even attended heated political debates. I tried to warn others about the dangers of state ownership, how it discourages innovation, stifles competition, and potentially jeopardizes the rights of workers and consumers.

However, my unpopular stance made me an outsider. My acquaintances viewed my resistance as a lack of patriotism or a result of selfish capitalist views. In the process, I became quite unpopular, isolated from those who once respected me.

However, I chose to stand by my principles. I refused to bend to the popular opinion. I felt it was more important to defend what I believed to be true than to be popular. If anything, the experience hardened my resolve and confirmed to me the importance of holding firm to one's convictions, regardless of the cost.

169,Samantha was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.,"Samantha's relationship with David had been rocky of late. Many late nights and tiffs over trust issues had created a chasm between them. Samantha, at her wit's end, decided to test their bond once more.

She had planned a surprise getaway for them to mend their worn out hearts. But a tempting event arose which had always been on David's bucket list. Samantha had firmly told David about the surprise on the same date as the event, hoping that he would choose their relationship over his individual pursuit.

The day arrived, Samantha packed her bags and hoped for the best. She reached the set destination, her heart pounding heavily against her chest. She held her breath when she saw a figure approaching in the distance. Relief washed over her as she recognised David's features, and she was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.","A. In the heart of a bustling diner, David, the incharge, was managing the chaos of the rush hour. David was a stern man, a stickler for cleanliness who loved order in his diner. Lately, he had been grappling with the recurring issue of a slippery floor. 

Just a week ago, a new hire, a young man named Jake, had joined their small team. Jake, like a breath of fresh air, brought a refreshing dedication to the monotonous tasks. He took David’s concerns about the slippery floor seriously and promised to remedy it. 

Today, as David walked around inspecting the diner, he couldn't help but notice the sparkly clean floor. His shoes made no squeaking noise, and he felt no slip under his soles. The stern lines on David's face dissolved into a broad smile, filling him with overjoying pride for his new hire. The floor had finally been cleaned properly and was no longer a potential hazard to anyone.
B. Larry had been a lifelong fan of the mystery writer, Arthur K. Bennett. The intrigue and suspense in Bennett's novels have kept him awake for countless nights. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the annual 'Mystery Writers Meet,' he had yet to receive an invite. The event was an exclusive gathering of esteemed authors and their ardent fans, and invitations were notoriously hard to come by. 

He had tried for years, writing heartfelt letters to the organizers explaining his love for Bennett's work. Each year, he eagerly awaited a positive response, but it never came. Larry was beginning to lose hope when one day a golden envelope arrived in his mailbox. His heart pounded in his chest as he recognized the official seal of the 'Mystery Writers Meet' stamped on it.

Barely believing his eyes, Larry ripped open the envelope and there it was – a personalized invitation for him to attend the event. The anticipation bubbled in his chest as he realized he would finally have the chance to meet the man whose stories had captured his imagination for so many years.
C. A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.
D. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.",A,
170,"Wow, your kid just graduated middle schoool! You must be filled with pride and joy.","Seeing my old friend Mark after so long, I was ecstatic to hear that his child had reached a significant milestone. ""Wow, your kid just graduated middle school!"" I exclaimed, hardly believing how much time had passed since our own school days. 

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.","A. The lawyers had traveled from various parts of the country to attend a prestigious business seminar in New York City. Dressed in crisp, expensive suits, they filled the room with an air of unspoken competition. Upon arrival, they had collected their name badges, exchanged courteous nods and pleasantries, and found their seats. 

As the seminar progressed, they listened intently to the speakers, taking meticulous notes and absorbing every new piece of information. The seminar was filled with informative sessions about business law, the evolving business environment, and how lawyers could adapt to these changes.

During the breaks, they began to form little clusters, engaging in heated discussions about the subjects at hand. The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves, dissecting the new strategies and theories presented. Opinions were shared, a healthy debate ensued, and insights were gained. 

The interactions at the seminar led to new connections and strengthened old ones. By the time the business seminar concluded, it was evident that the attending lawyers had not just learnt from the speakers, but also from each other.

C. My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.
D. In the world of modern politics, it has become increasingly crucial to gauge others before taking firm political stands. This wisdom was something that Charlie, a young political activist, learned the hard way. Charlie was passionate, eager, and had a habit of jumping headfirst into ideological battles without considering the repercussions.

One day, he decided to openly advocate for a controversial policy, believing it was the right thing to do. He was confident that his friends would support him as they had similar views, at least as far as he knew. However, he didn't take into account the fact that not everyone shared his beliefs and passion for political engagement.

When he started receiving backlash from acquaintances and even some close friends, Charlie was taken aback. He couldn't understand why people he thought were allies, were turning against him. The painful realization dawned upon him that not everyone was in his corner, and some were even willing to harm his reputation because of his political stance.

The experience taught him a hard lesson: In the volatile atmosphere of today's politics, it is better to gauge others' thoughts and feelings before taking such political stands. You never know who is on your side and who may cause you harm for it.",B,"D. In the world of modern politics, it has become increasingly crucial to gauge others before taking firm political stands.

B. Your best friend, Lilly, had a bad habit of procrastinating her schoolwork. Today, she texted you excitedly, saying she was heading to the luxury spa downtown instead of dealing with her mounting pile of assignments. You stared at her message, considering the possibility of joining her for a much-needed stress relief session. However, your own stack of homework caught your attention.

You remembered your mom's stern words from before, ""Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too."" You knew she was right, but the idea of ditching your homework for a moment of relaxation tempted you. You found yourself battling internally, a part of you yearning for the spa's tranquility and another part reminding you of your responsibilities.

You decided to reply to Lilly, wishing her a fun spa day and letting her know that you wouldn't be able to make it. As you settled down to your homework, you felt a strange sense of satisfaction, knowing that you were doing what was right for you. And while the spa could offer temporary comfort, finishing your homework would ultimately lead to long-term success and peace of mind.
C. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.
D. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention. This was a tradition established long ago during our university days. Tom was the president of the student council, responsible for organizing most of the major events on campus. He had a unique method for ensuring each event's success, isolating himself from the rest of us to focus completely.

Before every major event, Tom would retreat into solitude for days at a time. He would sit in his room, surrounded by piles of papers, charts, and notes, tirelessly working to iron out the minutest details of the event. Every element of the event, from the decor to the itinerary, was meticulously planned by him.

We often joked about Tom's obsessive planning habits. Yet, no one could deny the spectacular results he achieved. His dedication and focus always ensured an extraordinary event, much to the delight of everyone involved. As unusual as his methods were, Tom’s ability to deliver a successful event was unparalleled.",A,"s.

172,"Brian kept quiet at the board meeting, who knew he had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time.","Brian sat in the board meeting, the atmosphere heavy with tension. He knew his colleagues were worried about the company’s future. After all, recent business strategies had failed, and their key competitors were pulling ahead in the market. The executives, one by one, presented their plans, but none seemed to impress the room.

Brian, however, kept quiet. He was a man of few words, preferring to observe, analyze, and then act. His blue eyes scanned the room, evaluating each colleague as they spoke. He listened to their plans, their ideas, the desperation seeping into their words, their body language speaking volumes of the stress they were under.

What they didn’t know was that Brian had been secretly working on a brilliant idea for the past few months. He had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time, a plan he was convinced would not only save the company but also catapult it ahead of their competitors.","A. Over the past few weeks, the city was riveted by the high-profile case of a business mogul accused of fraud. It wasn't just another legal case, this was something that had held everyone's interest, given the stature of the individual involved. Word had been floating around that the mogul's defense was falling apart. But today, whispers filled the courtroom with a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown. It wasn't just a rumor, the buzz was everywhere - the coffee shops, the corridors of the courthouse, and even on live television reports. The news was intriguing - an unexpected turn in a case that seemed almost closed.

A hush fell over the courtroom as the defense lawyer rose, his face etched with a cryptic smile. He called upon the surprise eyewitness, who entered the room with a confident stride. With the appearance of this unexpected character, it seemed like the course of the trial was about to change drastically, adding a completely new dimension to the narrative. Everyone was on edge, wondering what revelations this newfound witness would unfold.
B. Walter sat in the library, the daunting exam paper in front of him. His palms were sweaty, his mind in a whirlwind. Despite his best efforts, when the scores came back, he found that he'd failed his crucial exam. He had studied days and nights, given up on his football matches, sacrificed his social life, all in hopes of acing this test. 

His heart pounding in his chest, he trudged home, dreading the moment he had to reveal his failure to his father. Upon his arrival, he steeled himself and blurted out his poor results. Instead of the feared outrage, his father calmly listened, looked him in the eyes, and finally said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk."" 

Walter looked at his father in astonishment, expecting more reprimand. But his father just patted his shoulder with a gentle smile, and he understood - it was just a failed exam, not the end of his life. His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.
C. James, the bouncer at the notorious West End Club, looked sternly at the young man standing before him. His name was Matt, a regular partygoer who had an infamous reputation for causing ruckus. Matt's face was filled with disbelief as James uttered the harsh words. ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist!""

Just a week ago, Matt had caused a scene by picking a fight with another club patron. Alcohol fuelled his arrogance and disregard for the night's merriment, which in turn led to his banishment. It wasn't the first time Matt had behaved in such a manner, but it was the last straw for the club's management.

Matt tried to argue, claiming he had changed, but the bouncer merely shook his head. A lesson had to be learned, and this party, the grandest of the year, was off-limits for him. Disappointed and crestfallen, Matt turned around and walked away, the loud beats of the party echoing behind him.
D. After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.",A,"the

173,"The savvy politician had a secret plan that could make him win. At the last moment, he revealed a scandalous secret about his opponent.","Harry Richardson, a savvy and seasoned politician, had spent his life mastering the art of political maneuvering. His charisma and charm were unmatched, but this time, he was facing a formidable opponent in the upcoming election, John Duncan. Though seemingly plain, Duncan's honesty and transparent policies were rapidly gaining popular appeal. It seemed as though the competition was going to be tougher than Harry had initially anticipated. 

Behind closed doors, Harry had crafted a secret plan, a wild card that he was certain would tip the scales in his favor. Weeks before the election, he received an anonymous tip about a scandal involving Duncan. He had spent painstaking hours verifying the information, ensuring not to leave any room for errors. At the last possible moment, just days before the election, he made his move.

In a televised press conference, Harry revealed the scandalous secret about Duncan involving financial fraud. The shocking revelation sent waves through the entire nation, causing a significant shift in public opinion. The scales indeed tipped and Harry was once again, thanks to his secret plan, the people's choice for leadership.","A. The atmosphere was tense as we walked into the boardroom, ready for the negotiations to begin. My heart pounded nervously while sweat trickled down my forehead. The proposal laid out before us represented the culmination of months of hard work, and it needed to succeed. The opposing party, a group of stern-faced businessmen, scrutinized every detail, challenging us at every turn. 

One moment they'd lean back, appearing disinterested, and the next moment they'd snap forward, blasting us with another onslaught of demands. Many times, it seemed like the deal would slip away. We huddled together, discussing counteroffers and strategies in hushed whispers while clutching at our lukewarm coffee cups for comfort. 

Hours of negotiations stretched into days, with the outcome looking grim. However, just as we thought we had lost, we managed to reach a compromise on their final condition. The deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations, leaving us with a sense of accomplishment and relief that was worth every stressful moment.
B. Peachwood Technologies, a mid-sized tech firm, had always boasted about its stable financial standing. However, this year had been turbulent and the company had taken a considerable financial hit due to unforeseen market conditions. As a result, the board was faced with a difficult decision when it came to the annual holiday bonus for its employees. 

The CEO, Martha, called for a company-wide virtual meeting to deliver the sobering news. In her heartfelt speech, she announced that the company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. She explained that the decision was a tough one and was taken only after exhausting all other cost-cutting alternatives. The announcement was met with disappointment, but Martha's honesty and transparency also earned her the respect of her employees. 

To soften the blow, Martha promised that the company would make up for the loss as soon as the financial situation improved. Despite the news, the employees took it in stride, understanding the difficulties faced by the company in these challenging times. The incident, although unfortunate, created a deeper bond among the employees and reinforced their commitment to the company.
C. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.
D. For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me. I had done it; I had conquered the spreadsheets, and most importantly, my fear of numbers.",C,"s, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the"
174,"The opponents are unaware of my greatest asset, which is my stamina. The other runners have no chance at all!.","At the starting line of the annual city marathon, I can see the intense determination in the eyes of my opponents. They stretch and jog in place, eager to claim the victory. What they don't understand, however, is that I possess a unique advantage. My greatest asset, largely hidden from their view, is my exceptional stamina. 

I've trained for years to build and maintain it, running countless miles in the dead of night when the world was fast asleep. I pushed my body beyond its limits, my legs aching and lungs gasping for breath. The strenuous workouts and tedious diet plans were all part of my secret strategy, ensuring a reserve of energy that won't easily dissipate. This strength allows me to keep going when others are gasping for breath, to maintain a steady pace when others begin to falter. 

I look at my opponents again, their faces filled with anticipation and nervous excitement. Little do they know that they stand no chance at all, for they are unaware of my greatest asset.","A. I noticed you were pretty disappointed that you missed out on Jason's party last Saturday. Honestly, at first, I thought you would've had a great time there with all your friends. Jason's parties are always epic and you were looking forward to it all week. 

However, it turned out to be quite different this time. The music was ridiculously loud, louder than any party I've ever heard of, and it continued late into the night. The partygoers were enjoying themselves, completely oblivious to the disturbance they were causing. 

The otherwise calm and peaceful neighborhood couldn't bear the noise and chaos. It was Mr. Johnson, our next-door neighbor, who lost his patience first. Disturbed and frustrated, he decided to call the police. Hence, it is good that you didn't get to go to the party as I heard the neighbors called the police and everyone got in trouble.
B. Lena had always been a diligent employee, focusing on her work and maintaining an immaculate track record. However, things changed when she unexpectedly stumbled upon her boss's hidden affairs. From shady business deals to tax evasions, her boss was involved in all sorts of illegal activities that threatened to bring down the reputation of the entire company.

At first, Lena thought about confronting him. Yet she knew well enough that he would dismiss her instantly, putting her and her family in financial hardship. Therefore, she decided to play it cool, pretending like she knew nothing, all the while gathering evidence to back her up.

The boss, on the other hand, remained oblivious to her newfound knowledge. He continued conducting his shady business, confident that no one could touch him. However, Lena became his hidden threat, silently looming over his head. She cannot be dismissed because she is aware of his shady business dealings and is ready to blow the whistle when the time is right.
C. Amelia Davis was a hard-hitting political figure known throughout the Golden State. A vibrant and charismatic woman, she had a knack for captivating anyone with her words and was always at the forefront of the political scene. In short, she was a renowned representative of California. But as she walked into the bustling coffee shop one rainy Tuesday morning, she noticed that no one gave her a second glance.

Her friend, John, a visiting politician from Arizona, was bewildered by this. He had expected some form of recognition, a nod of acknowledgment at the very least. He turned to the barista and exclaimed in disbelief, ""She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?""

The barista, a teenager with pink hair and numerous piercings, simply shrugged. ""Sorry, man, I just moved here from Ohio,"" she said, already turning to take the next customer's order. John was dumbfounded; Amelia merely chuckled at the welcome anonymity.
D. The economic depression that began to grip the nation was not a sudden event. In fact, it was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies that had been implemented over a period of years. The government, in a bid to stimulate economic growth, had begun to invest heavily in risky ventures.

Early on, the nation had seen a surge in economic activity. It seemed for a while that the risky policies were actually paying off. Yet, a keen observer would have noticed the unsustainable trajectory of this growth. Many companies, fueled by reckless investments, were expanding at a rate far beyond their means.

However, the bubble burst when these companies began defaulting on their loans. Banks, suddenly faced with massive losses, began to tighten their loan policies. As credit began to dry up, businesses started to fold, leading to layoffs and the economic depression. Therefore, it can be seen that this depression was not a random event, but a consequence of several risky fiscal policies.",B,"O .

175,I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown.,"Over the past few weeks, the city was riveted by the high-profile case of a business mogul accused of fraud. It wasn't just another legal case, this was something that had held everyone's interest, given the stature of the individual involved. Word had been floating around that the mogul's defense was falling apart. But today, whispers filled the courtroom with a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown. It wasn't just a rumor, the buzz was everywhere - the coffee shops, the corridors of the courthouse, and even on live television reports. The news was intriguing - an unexpected turn in a case that seemed almost closed.

A hush fell over the courtroom as the defense lawyer rose, his face etched with a cryptic smile. He called upon the surprise eyewitness, who entered the room with a confident stride. With the appearance of this unexpected character, it seemed like the course of the trial was about to change drastically, adding a completely new dimension to the narrative. Everyone was on edge, wondering what revelations this newfound witness would unfold.","A. Brian sat in the board meeting, the atmosphere heavy with tension. He knew his colleagues were worried about the company’s future. After all, recent business strategies had failed, and their key competitors were pulling ahead in the market. The executives, one by one, presented their plans, but none seemed to impress the room.

Brian, however, kept quiet. He was a man of few words, preferring to observe, analyze, and then act. His blue eyes scanned the room, evaluating each colleague as they spoke. He listened to their plans, their ideas, the desperation seeping into their words, their body language speaking volumes of the stress they were under.

What they didn’t know was that Brian had been secretly working on a brilliant idea for the past few months. He had an Ace hidden up his sleeve the whole time, a plan he was convinced would not only save the company but also catapult it ahead of their competitors.
B. Jimmy had spent the last few weeks fretting over his course selection for the next semester. He was a sophomore at the prestigious Canterbury University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. He had a deep interest in his field of study but deciding on what courses to take was proving to be a daunting task. The options were extensive and each course was as appealing as the other.

One afternoon, he decided to seek help and scheduled a meeting with Professor Marks. He was renowned in the University for his excellent teaching and deep knowledge of the field. Armed with a list of courses, Jimmy met with the professor. The professor's deep insight into each course, its prospects and challenges offered Jimmy a clear perspective about his choices.

By the end of the discussion, Jimmy felt less overwhelmed. He was reassured after consulting with the Professor Marks about what courses to take next semester, and he finally felt ready to take on the next step in his educational journey.
C. Once upon a time, there lived a talented painter named Alex. He was renowned for his traditional approach to his craft, sticking with a set of specific colors that portrayed the natural world around him. One sunny day, Alex decided to paint the vibrant, yellow sunflower fields he'd encountered on his latest journey. However, as he gathered his supplies, he realized that he had left his yellow paint at his studio.

Dismayed but not disheartened, Alex contemplated on how to move forward. After much contemplation, he took a deep breath and chose an unconventional path. He decided to paint the sunflower fields using only red paint, a color that starkly contrasted the original vibrant yellow of the fields.

The result was a masterpiece, where the sunflowers bloomed in an entirely different hue, a bold, captivating red. When it was displayed in his upcoming art show, it became the talk of the town and attracted art enthusiasts from all corners. And so, what started as a missing color pot, led to Alex's painting being famous for its unconventional choice, thus redefining his artistic approach.
D. My life took a catastrophic turn when I lost my home and possessions in a devastating fire. My life felt like it was a collapsed jenga tower; everything I had built, everything I owned, had turned to ash in one horrifying night. The incident left me both emotionally and financially broken. I had no family to return to, no childhood home to seek refuge in. 

In my darkest hour, an opportunity to start over knocked at my door. I accepted a job offer from an old friend who owned a company in Arkansas. Barely a month after the disaster, I packed what little I owned into my old car and started my journey to the 'Natural State.' It was a new beginning for me, a chance to rebuild from scratch in a place where no one knew about my tragedies.

A few months into my new life, on an impulsive whim, I bought a lottery ticket. The gods must have seen the trials I'd been through, or maybe luck just felt like it owed me one. Miraculously, I won the Arkansas state lottery. It was a joy beyond belief, a silver lining after a devastating storm. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery, turning my life around entirely.",A,

Mr. Davis, a seasoned mathematics teacher, had been grappling with the challenging task of explaining the concept of calculus to his class. Over several weeks, he'd attempted various methods, yet felt he hadn't fully reached his students. His frustration was growing, but he refused to give up, knowing the importance of this particular topic.

One day, he stumbled upon an interactive mathematics game online, which presented complex topics in a simplified, engaging manner. With newfound optimism, he decided to incorporate this method into his teaching. The following day, he introduced the game to his students, explaining that it would be their new means of understanding calculus. 

As the days passed, he watched their progress closely, anticipating that he was onto something. Soon, their class participation, homework submissions, and test scores indicated a surge in understanding. It was the day when one of the most quiet students voluntarily solved a complex problem on the board that Mr. Davis knew he had finally succeeded. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students. His sense of accomplishment radiated through the classroom, bringing a new energy that inspired even more learning.
B. In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.
C. At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.

So, when she decided to visit the city museum, she spent the evening strategizing the perfect timing. She knew that most of the museum visitors arrived between six and eight in the morning. The thought of having to negotiate her way through a crowd did not appeal to her.

Looking online, she found a blog suggesting that the ideal time to visit the museum was one hour before the peak hours. It wasn't just about beating the crowd, but also the opportunity to enjoy the exhibits in quiet reflection. Hence, she decided to arrive at the museum at five, an hour earlier than most visitors.

The next morning, she got ready and reached the museum at five sharp. As she stepped into the empty corridors of the museum, she was delighted. She had the entire place to herself, able to take her time and truly appreciate the exhibits. Joanna smiled, knowing her plan had worked out perfectly.
B. Emily and John had been business partners for years and they always worked things out smoothly. But, this time it was different. It was about a business proposal that needed immediate attention and a crucial decision. John, out of over-confidence or ignorance, didn't discuss the problem with Emily right then and there.

Emily got the news the next day when the proposal fell apart. She was furious. ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" she lamented to John, her voice echoing throughout their office. She tried to keep her emotions under control, but it was difficult. ""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" she added, her eyes filled with a rare frustration.

John, understanding his lapse, felt guilt welling up inside him. He didn't want the partnership, built over mutual trust and understanding, to suffer due to his momentary lapse of judgment. He realized the need for immediate action to correct this error. In the silence of their office, he vowed to make things right, no matter how much effort it demanded from him. He hoped his efforts could preserve their relationship and rectify the problem he had caused in their business partnership.
C. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.

178,I hold it against him for not treating me with respect.,"Ever since we were kids, Jack and I had a friendship that others envied. We grew up next door, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures in our small, quiet town. The bond was genuine, and I believed we'd always be there for each other. However, as we grew older and life became more complex, I noticed a change in Jack's behavior.

Our conversations started becoming one-sided with him ignoring my words and even belittling my opinions. It stung more than I was willing to admit. That was not the Jack I knew and cherished. The Jack I knew was empathetic, understanding, and most importantly, respectful. Thus, I couldn't help but hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In response, I distanced myself, feeling betrayed and upset. I missed our old friendship, but I couldn't overlook his disrespectful behavior. With time, I managed to accept the change, holding onto the memories of our past and hoping that one day, the Jack I once knew would return.","A. After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred. She had earned her freedom after years of laborious study and now was the time to enjoy it. The thought of experiencing new cultures and translating them onto her canvas excited Emily more than any high-paying job could ever do.
B. For as long as they had known each other, Sam had been supportive, understanding, and incredibly patient with Peter. They shared many moments together, both good and bad, which had made them close friends. Despite the ups and downs in their friendship, Sam had always tried to be a good friend to Peter. She was willing to look past Peter's idiosyncrasies, as that's what friends do.

However, one day, Peter crossed a line. During one of their usual chats, he started making fun of Sam's insecurities. Sam had confided in him about her fears and self-doubts, trusting him not to use them against her. But Peter decided to poke fun at them, laughing at her apprehensions while completely disregarding her feelings.

The hurtful incident made Sam reassess their friendship. She decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore, realizing that a true friend would not use her vulnerabilities as a source of amusement. From then on, Sam distanced herself from Peter, deciding to surround herself with people who respected her feelings and insecurities.
C. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
D. There are days when I'm knee-deep in paperwork and plagued by a series of never-ending office meetings that a thought crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job. Perhaps then, I would be researching in a lab or writing a thesis, far removed from the politics and monotony of corporate life. 

I often find myself imagining a life in an academic institution surrounded by books and great minds, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Those thoughts often come wrapped in a sense of regret, along with an acute sense of longing for a path I did not choose. And it's not just about escaping my current predicament, it's about doing something fulfilling and being a part of something bigger. 

However, I must admit that I might have romanticized the whole concept of pursuing a higher degree. The late nights working on a research paper, the pressure to publish, the uncertainty of grants and fellowships – these are aspects I conveniently overlook while daydreaming. Besides, having spent a significant amount of time in a corporate setting, I have gained practical knowledge and insights that an academic path might not have provided. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side, and it's easy to long for what we don't have while ignoring the value of what we do have.",B,s and the 201990s and the 20188 the 888 the 8 the 0 the 0 the 8 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the 0 the the 0 the the 0 the 0 the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the 0 the the 0 the 0 the 0 the the the the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the the the the the the the the the 0 the the 0 the  the  the 0 the  the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the the the 0 the the 0 the 0 the the 0 the 0 the 0 the  the  the  the  the  the  the 0 the the 0 the 0 the  the  the
179,I am mad at Kim for choosing not to support me at my wedding.,"I had been counting on Kim, my closest friend since childhood, to stand by my side during one of the most important days of my life. Her excitement matched mine when I first shared the news of my engagement, and naturally, I assumed she would be my maid of honor. But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry, my wedding marred by the startling realization that Kim had chosen not to support me on my special day.","A. For as long as they had known each other, Sam had been supportive, understanding, and incredibly patient with Peter. They shared many moments together, both good and bad, which had made them close friends. Despite the ups and downs in their friendship, Sam had always tried to be a good friend to Peter. She was willing to look past Peter's idiosyncrasies, as that's what friends do.

However, one day, Peter crossed a line. During one of their usual chats, he started making fun of Sam's insecurities. Sam had confided in him about her fears and self-doubts, trusting him not to use them against her. But Peter decided to poke fun at them, laughing at her apprehensions while completely disregarding her feelings.

The hurtful incident made Sam reassess their friendship. She decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore, realizing that a true friend would not use her vulnerabilities as a source of amusement. From then on, Sam distanced herself from Peter, deciding to surround herself with people who respected her feelings and insecurities.
B. Upon waking up, I looked out of the window and noticed a light dusting of frost on the ground. It was certainly chilly, but not as cold as the winter days could get. ""It's not that cold today,"" I murmured to myself. However, it still seemed chilly enough to make me uncomfortable in my fall jacket.

Normally, I would relish in the walk to work, as it was a part of my daily routine and helped me stay fit. But currently, the stakes were higher. I was due to present a crucial project next week, one that I have been preparing for months. Getting sick at this juncture was not an option I could afford.

As I analyzed the situation, I realized the walk could expose me to a potential flu, and maybe worsen the situation. Despite my love for walking, I decided I'd still go by car today. It was not worth the risk of falling ill and jeopardizing my important presentation.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.
D. The highly anticipated opening of the local theater's newest play, ""Murder in the Manor,"" was approaching. Everything had been planned meticulously, from the intricate set designs to the finely tailored costumes. However, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play, threatening its ultimate success.

First, the star actor, known for his melodramatic portrayal of the villain, fell ill with laryngitis. His unique voice was a trademark of his performances, and without it, the play was off to a rocky start. Next, a critical prop, the ornate dagger for the climactic murder scene, was mysteriously lost. The team had searched everywhere but to no avail. 

As if matters couldn't get worse, a fire broke out in the costume room, causing damage to several important pieces. Then, the heavy, antique chandelier, a vital part of the set, crashed onto the stage during a rehearsal, narrowly missing the stand-ins. Furthermore, incessant rainfall led to a leak in the theatre's roof, flooding the orchestra pit.

Despite these setbacks, the determined cast and crew soldiered on, refusing to let their hard work go to waste. Their resilience in the face of adversity was a testament to their passion for the theater. After all, the show must go on.",A,"#1.

180,I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.,"From the moment I walked into the party that night, I felt an odd tension in the air. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, but something felt amiss. I brushed it off, attributing it to the slight anxiety I always had at social events. It was not until I ran into Nick, a dear friend I had known since grade school, that I realized the source of my discomfort.

We engaged in small talk, but the conversation quickly escalated into an argument, right in the middle of the party. His harsh words resonated throughout the room, the sound of laughter and music fading in the background. I stood there, shocked and humiliated as Nick unleashed a barrage of personal insults on me, for no apparent reason.

Our shared memories and the deep bond we had forged over the years instantly shattered. I felt a cold, heavy feeling settle in my heart as I walked out of the party, leaving behind a room full of murmurs and confused faces. I vowed then and there, that as much as it pained me, I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.","A.

B. John had always been the type to ignore minor problems, allowing them to fester until they became significant issues. One morning, he noticed his car making an odd, grumbling noise. It was a small thing, but a clear sign of something potentially amiss under the hood. ""Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage,"" his wife, Martha, had admonished him countless times. 

But John, ever the procrastinator, chose to put it off. He was busy with work, and besides, the car seemed to be running fine. His mother's old adage echoed in his ears, ""A stitch in time saves nine,"" but he brushed it off, thinking it could wait.

Three days later, the grumbling noise became a horrendous clanging and the engine gave out halfway to work. John ended up stranded in the middle of a busy highway during peak rush hour. He then had to arrange for a tow, miss an important meeting, and pay a heavy repair bill, all of which could have been avoided if he’d listened to his wife and mother. So, he learned the hard way, ignoring the problem only made it worse.
C. Many people often cringe when they hear about the color combination of orange and green. They claim it's too bold, too loud, or just plain ugly. People tend to lean towards subtle color combinations like black and white or blue and grey. However, I hold a different perspective on this matter. I believe orange and green to be one of the best color combinations out there.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by nature, I've seen the unique blend of these colors every fall. The vibrant green of the trees slowly turning into a beautiful orange, creating an atmosphere that's both calm and energetic. I remember the warmth and comfort these colors brought me during those chilly autumn evenings.

This is not just about nostalgia or personal preferences. I've noticed how orange and green can effortlessly represent both warm and cool tones, creating a perfect balance. No matter what others think, to me, the color combination of orange and green will always be a representation of beauty, warmth, and serenity.
D. After a seemingly endless week of turbulent storms, the weather finally became pleasant. The gray, heavy clouds that had been hanging low in the sky like an oppressive blanket were replaced with a soft, clean blue expanse. For days, the town had been relentlessly pounded by rain, lightning tearing through the skies with a fury that sent shivers down one's spine. The wind had shrieked, howling like a banshee as it tore through the deserted streets, ripping leaves from the trees.

The townspeople had huddled inside their homes, watching nervously as the rain pelted against the windows, hoping the storm would soon pass. Children had been kept indoors, their laughter and joy missed in the quiet town. It was a week that many thought would never end, yet it did. Finally, the storm retreated, leaving behind a calmness that was almost surreal.

Sunlight poured down from the cloudless sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the town. The streets were filled with laughter and joy once more, as children dashed outside, thrilled to be free of the gloominess. The weather had finally become pleasant following the stormy week, leaving a sense of peace and relief that hung heavy in the air.",A,#1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678

When Kevin joined the town's local soccer team, he was instantly worshipped by the new recruits, who all considered him to be the best player in the game. They had all watched the televised match where he had scored a spectacular goal from the halfway line, securing his team's victory in the state championship. This one action had immortalized him in their minds as the undisputed king of soccer.

However, everything changed when they finally had the chance to meet him in person. During their first practice session, the recruits were expecting a display of extraordinary skills and game strategy from Kevin. But all they saw was a regular player, good but nowhere near the legendary figure they had idolized. 

The reality hit home during a casual conversation when Kevin admitted that the famous goal that everyone raved about was just a fluke. He had intended to pass the ball to a teammate and not score from such an impossible distance. The confession was a shock to the new recruits but it also humanized Kevin for them. They now admired him more for his humility and honesty, and less for a spectacular goal that was, after all, just a lucky strike.
B. Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.
C. Ever since we were kids, Jack and I had a friendship that others envied. We grew up next door, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures in our small, quiet town. The bond was genuine, and I believed we'd always be there for each other. However, as we grew older and life became more complex, I noticed a change in Jack's behavior.

Our conversations started becoming one-sided with him ignoring my words and even belittling my opinions. It stung more than I was willing to admit. That was not the Jack I knew and cherished. The Jack I knew was empathetic, understanding, and most importantly, respectful. Thus, I couldn't help but hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In response, I distanced myself, feeling betrayed and upset. I missed our old friendship, but I couldn't overlook his disrespectful behavior. With time, I managed to accept the change, holding onto the memories of our past and hoping that one day, the Jack I once knew would return.
D. Joanna had always been a planner. So, when she decided to visit the city museum, she spent the evening strategizing the perfect timing. She knew that most of the museum visitors arrived between six and eight in the morning. The thought of having to negotiate her way through a crowd did not appeal to her.

Looking online, she found a blog suggesting that the ideal time to visit the museum was one hour before the peak hours. It wasn't just about beating the crowd, but also the opportunity to enjoy the exhibits in quiet reflection. Hence, she decided to arrive at the museum at five, an hour earlier than most visitors.

The next morning, she got ready and reached the museum at five sharp. As she stepped into the empty corridors of the museum, she was delighted. She had the entire place to herself, able to take her time and truly appreciate the exhibits. Joanna smiled, knowing her plan had worked out perfectly.",C,s are a great.

182,Karen is upset with Sandy for not telling her about her plans for the summer.,"Karen had always been the type of friend who valued openness and honesty. Thus, when she discovered that Sandy, her best friend since grade school, had made plans for the summer without informing her, she felt a sting of betrayal. 

For years, they had shared every intricate detail of their lives, right down to what they had for breakfast. That's why Sandy's silence about her summer plans had taken Karen aback. It wasn't that Karen expected to be included in every aspect of Sandy's life, but the sudden change in their routine felt abrupt and unexpected.

Consequently, a seed of doubt and apprehension was planted in Karen's mind. She started to question their entire friendship. The insecurity made her revisit their shared memories with a more suspicious eye.

Karen decided to confront Sandy about it. She hoped that discussing her feelings would bring clarity to the situation and reassure her about the strength of their bond. But the question remained, would Sandy understand Karen's concern or would this incident drive a wedge between them?","A. Dr. Smith, the chemistry professor at Northwood University, sat quietly in his office preparing to deliver some unfortunate news. He had been grading papers all morning when he'd noticed a peculiar mistake in his register. One of his top students, Anna, had been marked as having scored an A in Chemistry. Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.
B. At the starting line of the annual city marathon, I can see the intense determination in the eyes of my opponents. They stretch and jog in place, eager to claim the victory. What they don't understand, however, is that I possess a unique advantage. My greatest asset, largely hidden from their view, is my exceptional stamina. 

I've trained for years to build and maintain it, running countless miles in the dead of night when the world was fast asleep. I pushed my body beyond its limits, my legs aching and lungs gasping for breath. The strenuous workouts and tedious diet plans were all part of my secret strategy, ensuring a reserve of energy that won't easily dissipate. This strength allows me to keep going when others are gasping for breath, to maintain a steady pace when others begin to falter. 

I look at my opponents again, their faces filled with anticipation and nervous excitement. Little do they know that they stand no chance at all, for they are unaware of my greatest asset.

D. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.",C,"```

They shared the same dorm room, same classes, and even the same study schedules. Despite their distinct personalities, they found comfort in their similarities and shared struggles. However, everything changed after one heated argument.

The girls had been studying for their upcoming finals when Amy, stressed and overworked, lost her temper. She berated Mary in a fit of frustration, accusing her of not taking their studies seriously. Mary, taken aback by Amy's outburst, felt hurt by the harsh words. It wasn't just the content, but the tone in which Amy had spoken to her that upset Mary deeply.

The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.

Finally, after years of practicing and getting motivation from his friends, he decided to give his dream a shot. The local theatre group was holding auditions for their renowned dance team that day, the perfect opportunity for Lester.

Yet, time slipped from Lester's hands as he double-checked every detail. From his costume to the dance steps, he didn't want to leave any room for mistakes. With this meticulous preparation, he was running extremely late and the audition was about to be closed.

Almost out of breath, he reached the venue just in time, by the skin of his teeth. With a quick apology for his tardiness, he took the stage. Performing his well-practiced routine, Lester astounded everyone with his exceptional skills and passion. It was a close call, but, in the end, Lester made the dance team, showing everyone that it is never too late to chase your dreams.","A. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire. Meet James Harrison, a self-made millionaire who lives in New York City. He made his fortune in the tech industry but chose to remain humble and unassuming despite his wealth. 

Every morning, he puts on the same attire: a plain black t-shirt, khaki pants, and worn-out sneakers. To the average eye, he appears to be just another face in the crowd. He spends his days not in opulent boardrooms, but rather in quaint cafes, where he is always absorbed in either a novel or his laptop, ever curious and eager to learn. 

James prefers solitude and discretion over the fanfare associated with high society. He believes that true worth isn't measured by the price tag on your clothes but by the richness of your character and the value you bring to society. At the end of the day, James Harrison, in his simple clothes, is far more than a millionaire; he's a millionaire with a purpose.
B. The highly anticipated opening of the local theater's newest play, ""Murder in the Manor,"" was approaching. Everything had been planned meticulously, from the intricate set designs to the finely tailored costumes. However, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play, threatening its ultimate success.

First, the star actor, known for his melodramatic portrayal of the villain, fell ill with laryngitis. His unique voice was a trademark of his performances, and without it, the play was off to a rocky start. Next, a critical prop, the ornate dagger for the climactic murder scene, was mysteriously lost. The team had searched everywhere but to no avail. 

As if matters couldn't get worse, a fire broke out in the costume room, causing damage to several important pieces. Then, the heavy, antique chandelier, a vital part of the set, crashed onto the stage during a rehearsal, narrowly missing the stand-ins. Furthermore, incessant rainfall led to a leak in the theatre's roof, flooding the orchestra pit.

Despite these setbacks, the determined cast and crew soldiered on, refusing to let their hard work go to waste. Their resilience in the face of adversity was a testament to their passion for the theater. After all, the show must go on.
C. In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.
D. For decades, the secret police had instilled fear among the citizens of the city. They were a menacing force, relentless and ruthless, conducting their operations in the shadows. The mere thought of crossing paths with them was a nightmare. Yet, they had an individual on their radar, a man named Peter.

People thought it impossible to escape their relentless pursuit, but Peter was not ordinary. Peter, an unassuming yet resilient man, found himself caught up in their web. He was under constant surveillance, and any wrong move would have dire consequences.

One day, Peter received an anonymous tip-off about a plan to arrest him. It was then that he plotted his daring escape. Relying on his intelligence and quick thinking, Peter successfully managed to escape, narrowly avoiding their traps. The escape was far too close for comfort, giving him several heart-stopping moments, but he managed to slip away nonetheless. 

Word of Peter's daring escape spread among the citizens, igniting hope. While people had always believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter's audacious feat proved otherwise.",D,"C.

The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, their faces reflecting a mixture of exhaustion, anxiety, and a glimmer of triumph.
B. After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.
C. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.
D. As the sun began to peek over the horizon, I turned to my wife and declared, ""To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable."" She agreed, as she too craved the freshest, ripest fruits and vegetables for our kitchen. We prepared swiftly, eager to encounter the magic that the early morning market held.

Upon reaching the bustling farmer's market, we could immediately see the array of farm-fresh produce, handmade crafts, and baked goods on display. We headed first to Mr. Johnson's stall, knowing that he brings the juiciest apples and the crunchiest lettuce. Early birds like us got the finest picks, much better than the wilted leftovers during the noon rush.

Next, we scurried towards Mrs. Peters' bakery stand, the aroma of her freshly baked bread filling the air. Again, arriving early gave us the advantage of getting the warm, soft loaves, just out of the oven. As the day wore on, Mrs. Peter's beautiful pastries would disappear, leaving only a few less desirable choices.

Finally, with our bags brimming with the best produce and goods the market offered, we returned home satisfied. Arriving at the farmer's market early was indeed the key to securing the best batch. As the morning sun began to climb higher, we started preparing our meals, knowing that we had the freshest ingredients, thanks to our early morning adventure.",A,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

John was always an adventurous soul, constantly in search of new thrills. This time, he had decided to conquer the steep, rocky terrain of the Rocky Mountains. It was a bright sunny day and the conditions seemed perfect for his climbing expedition.

He had almost reached the top when his foot slipped on a loose piece of rock. Just at the edge of the cliff, he found himself teetering precariously, his heart pounding against his chest. Panic threatened to seize him as he felt the rocky ground crumble beneath his grip. 

But in an act of quick thinking, he managed to hold on to a sturdy rock protruding from the edge. His fingers ached from the pressure as he struggled to pull himself up. Just as his strength was about to give out, a strong hand reached out, clutching him securely. It was his friend, Mike, who had reached the top first and was now saving John in the nick of time. It was a close call, a brush with death, but John was saved, left with an adrenaline rush and a newfound respect for the mountains.
B. Jake, a friend of mine, had been trapped in the 12th grade for the last five years. His academic journey had been a rollercoaster ride, filled with numerous obstacles and failures. It seemed like the universe was conspiring to prevent Jake from achieving his dream of graduating high school. Every year, he would start the academic term with a fervor, attending classes, participating actively, and submitting all his assignments on time. 

However, as the school year wore on, he would lose his momentum, often finding himself unable to keep up with his classmates. This became a recurring pattern, earning him the dubious honor of being the oldest student in our grade. His spirit was dampened, but his determination to pass was unwavering. He enlisted tutors, spent countless hours studying and sought advice from previous graduates.

Finally, in his sixth attempt, the persistent efforts of Jake bore fruit. With a weary yet triumphant smile, Jake held up his high school diploma, finally succeeding to pass the 12th grade, proof that persistence and dedication can overcome even the toughest of hurdles.
C. After a harsh and unforgiving defeat in the last season, the Panthers were left heartbroken. Team morale hit an all-time low, and the players knew something needed to change. On one fateful day, the team collectively agreed to fire their manager, believing that this was the first step to change their fate. The decision was indeed a difficult one, but they decided to prioritize the survival of the team.

In the wake of the termination, the Panthers began the grueling task of restructuring their strategies. They trained relentlessly, committing every hour, every minute, and every second they could spare. They worked on their weaknesses, turning them into strengths; they refined their strengths, making them unparalleled. Each team member started to have a spark in their eyes again, a spark that reflected their unyielding determination.

As the new season approached, a newfound sense of hope and motivation filled the locker room. The Panthers were ready to give it their all, not just to compete, but to seize the title this season and prove to everyone that they were champions, through and through.
D. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",A,"```

This particular university was famed for its cutting-edge curriculum and boasted faculty with Silicon Valley experience. His academics were good, but he knew competition was fierce and this university only accepted the best of the best. The admission process was rigorous, and Daniel had spent sleepless nights preparing for it.

When he finally submitted his application, he could only pray and hope his efforts would pay off. He spent weeks in nervous anticipation, each day intensifying his anxiety. The day finally arrived when he received an email from the university. His heart pounded in his chest as he opened it, slowly reading the contents.

B. Walter sat in the library, the daunting exam paper in front of him. His palms were sweaty, his mind in a whirlwind. Despite his best efforts, when the scores came back, he found that he'd failed his crucial exam. He had studied days and nights, given up on his football matches, sacrificed his social life, all in hopes of acing this test. 

His heart pounding in his chest, he trudged home, dreading the moment he had to reveal his failure to his father. Upon his arrival, he steeled himself and blurted out his poor results. Instead of the feared outrage, his father calmly listened, looked him in the eyes, and finally said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk."" 

Walter looked at his father in astonishment, expecting more reprimand. But his father just patted his shoulder with a gentle smile, and he understood - it was just a failed exam, not the end of his life. His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.
C. The once united local soccer club now presents a vastly different scene. Recently, it's been divided into distinct groups. Intriguingly, these groups are divided on regional lines. Each region in the neighborhood has its representative group at the club. This unique approach has spurred a friendly rivalry among the members and instilled a new sense of enthusiasm.

Despite the division, the members within each group share a deep bond. They come together multiple times a week, meeting regularly on the green expanse of the soccer field. Hours are spent practicing and perfecting their skills, their dedication almost palpable. They motivate and support each other, fostering a sense of camaraderie that seeps beyond the soccer field.

Meanwhile, the matches between the regional groups have become a spectacle that the entire community looks forward to. They create an energetic atmosphere as they proudly cheer for their representatives. Amidst all the competition and rivalry, the groups have unwittingly brought the whole neighborhood together, strengthening the sense of unity in their community.
D. In the heart of a small, peaceful town lived a man named Gerald. He was an enormous figure known for his temper as fierce as a wild storm. One day, a dispute arose between him and a fellow townsperson about a piece of land both claimed ownership of. With each accusation the other man threw, Gerald's temper began to flare up.

Veins popped out from his neck as his anger intensified, and his voice echoed like thunder through the silent streets. The crowd around them flinched at his every word, each one sharper and harsher than the last. His rage had controlled him, made him a roaring lion amongst the frightened lambs. But, after spewing out his frustrations, Gerald's storm slowly began to calm. 

He felt a heaviness lift from his chest as he expelled his rage, his mind clearing like the sky after a tempest. After letting off his rage, he sat down like a lamb, his once roaring demeanor replaced with a calm one, realizing that anger was no solution to their problem.",A,"```

C. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
D. Once upon a time, Mark and John were neighbors who didn't get along very well. They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them. One rainy day, John's basement was flooded, leaving his family in a state of distress.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were. They both chuckled over their previous arguments, understanding how senseless their hostility was. So one day, as they stood in the backyard, Mark smiled and said to John, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

189,Philly won the game but the opponent was just as good and also came close to victory.,"The match was in Philadelphia; the city was charged with excitement and anticipation. The game was baseball, Philadelphia's own Phillies against their formidable opponent, the Dodgers. The stadium was swarming with fans, both sides buzzing with unbridled excitement.

From the first inning, it was evident that the game would be no cakewalk for either team. The Phillies displayed an impeccable form, their pitcher hurling the baseball with precision and speed. However, the Dodgers were just as tenacious. With every pitch, they countered with agility, their bats swishing through the air, keeping the score neck-and-neck. 

As the game extended into the ninth inning, it became clear that victory was within reach for both teams. The Phillies, however, drew upon a surge of energy and managed to score a critical run. Though the Dodgers were just as good and came close to the win, their efforts fell short. In the end, it was Philly who clinically secured the game, much to the delight of their home crowd.","A. I had been invited to a last-minute gala event by my wealthy cousin, who loved to flaunt her opulence and status in high society. My heart sank when I received the invitation; I knew I couldn't afford a gala-worthy dress on my current salary. One day, while I was complaining about my predicament to my neighbor, she disappeared into her house and came back out holding a vintage burgundy gown that she had worn in the 80s. 

That dress wasn't exactly what I would have picked for myself; the puff shoulder sleeves and sequin details screamed old-fashioned. Moreover, the color was a shade or two darker than I normally preferred. But, hey, it was free, and I'm broke right now, a consequence of losing my job due to company downsizing. 

I managed to make the dress work with some minor alterations and a modern belt to cinch in the waist, transforming it into something more contemporary. The night of the gala, I walked into the grand hall, feeling self-conscious in the outdated dress. To my surprise, the dress was a hit. Many people complimented the 'vintage vibe' and thought I was being fashion-forward. As I danced the night away, I couldn't help but smile. Free or not, the dress became the life of the party, and I proved that style is not dependent on money but individual creativity and confidence.
B. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.
C. The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, their faces reflecting a mixture of exhaustion, anxiety, and a glimmer of triumph.
D. For decades, Thomas had been an artful dodger of tax payments. Every year, he would sit at his large mahogany desk and meticulously find every possible loophole that he could exploit to avoid contributing to the government coffers. He had a plethora of offshore bank accounts, businesses registered under different aliases, and he'd even explored the uncharted territory of cryptocurrency. He saw himself as a fiscal genius, a virtuoso of financial evasion. He was proud of his growing wealth and truly believed that he was outwitting the system.

Everything seemed perfect in his paradise of deceit until one cold January morning when a knock on his door echoed through his mansion. The men who stood on his doorstep were not interested in the expensive artwork on the walls or the luxury cars in the driveway. Their focus was on the man who had managed to avoid paying taxes for more than twenty years. The Internal Revenue Service, along with the FBI, had finally caught on to his illicit activities. Now, after years of enjoying his ill-gotten wealth, Thomas was staring at the possibility of nearly 10 years behind the cold, bleak bars of a federal prison.",C,"# 1.

190,"Listen, losing weight is easier said than done, many people lack commitment.","Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.","A. Margaret had recently graduated with a degree in mathematics, full of knowledge and enthusiasm to share her love for numbers and equations. But when she was offered her first job as a math teacher at a local high school, the realization struck her; to teach a class of even 10 students can be daunting for a first-timer like herself.

Despite the initial nerves, Margaret knew she had to face her fears. She believed in her abilities, but there was a gap between understanding concepts personally and successfully imparting that knowledge onto others. The task required more than just proficiency in her subject. It needed a lot of dedication and preparation to explain ideas well, she realized.

She started preparing with great earnest, rehearsing her lessons multiple times and preparing examples to better explain the more challenging concepts. She constantly read up on new teaching techniques, worked on her communication skills, and tried to anticipate the questions her students might have.

When the big day finally arrived, Margaret was armed with thorough preparation and a heightened sense of responsibility. As she faced her first class, she took a deep breath and started, ""Good morning, everyone. Today we will embark on an exciting journey of numbers and equations."" That day, she took her first step to becoming not just a teacher, but an effective communicator and motivator for her students.
B. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.
C. Nina was not in the mood for distractions today, as she slipped on her headphones at her desk. Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.
D. George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.",A,"s program. The 2ft.

191,It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic. Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos.,"On a typical weekday morning, Tom woke up and thought of a new challenge - he decided to drive to his office for the first time. Having only recently acquired his driving license, Tom was eager to flaunt his new skill. Looking out the window, he saw the bustle of the city roads, and naively thought, ""It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic."" 

As he got into his car, a sense of determination flooded him. He started his journey, but very soon was submerged into the chaotic labyrinth of urban traffic. Cars of all sizes were trying to outsmart each other, trying to find any room possible to pass through. The honking horns and the frequent brake lights turned his simple morning drive into a nerve-racking test. 

An hour passed in what seemed like an eternity, and Tom found himself only halfway to his destination. He then realized the truth of the common saying, ""Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos."" Wiping the sweat off his brow, Tom quietly admired those who braved these roads daily. He understood that driving wasn't just about controlling the steering wheel, but it also required adaptability and a lot of patience. He decided then and there that he needed more practice before he could join the ranks of those seasoned drivers.","A. Being accepted into the prestigious Hawthorne Institute is not an easy task. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam, a test designed to measure not only the intelligence but the perseverance and determination of the applicants. Not everyone can pass it; every year, out of hundreds of candidates, only a handful of the brightest and most determined scholars make it through.

Take the case of Amelia Jenkins, a determined and passionate student who had her eyes set on the Institute since her early childhood. Day in and day out, she would immerse herself in her studies, foregoing social events and other recreational activities. She understood that casual leisure was a luxury she couldn't afford at the moment. 

Yet, even with such intense determination and unwavering focus, Amelia found herself struggling with some of the complex problems in the entrance exam. She realized that merely studying hard would not guarantee her success; she needed to study smart as well. Adopting new strategies and methods, she started approaching the problems from a different perspective. Eventually, with her relentless effort, she managed to clear the exam, proving that while the task was indeed challenging, it was not impossible. It merely required an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, and a smart approach to problem-solving.
B. As an engineering student, I had gotten used to unexpected challenges and pressure. Yet, I was not prepared for what happened during our final semester. My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.
C. On a snowy night, in a tiny town on the edge of the world, there was a house so old, every nook and corner echoed stories of time. This house was lit only by the glow of a hundred candles; an extraordinary sight to see from the outside, creating a sparkling mirage against the backdrop of the cold white surroundings. 

However, one day a strong breeze blew through the house, extinguishing all the candles and leaving it in complete darkness. The owners of the house, an elderly couple, did not have any extra candles. ""No light can be found from an unlit candle,"" the old man muttered, feeling around in the darkness. His wife echoed his thoughts, sighing in dismay. 

Despair started to seep in when they thought of the long, cold night that awaited them. However, the old lady remembered a tiny, forgotten candle she had saved for years, tucked away in a corner. With a striking match, the last candle was lit, casting a warm glow in the room. The house had lost its grandeur for the night, but the couple was content, comforted by the small but enduring glow of their solitary candle.
D. At the starting line of the annual city marathon, I can see the intense determination in the eyes of my opponents. They stretch and jog in place, eager to claim the victory. What they don't understand, however, is that I possess a unique advantage. My greatest asset, largely hidden from their view, is my exceptional stamina. 

I've trained for years to build and maintain it, running countless miles in the dead of night when the world was fast asleep. I pushed my body beyond its limits, my legs aching and lungs gasping for breath. The strenuous workouts and tedious diet plans were all part of my secret strategy, ensuring a reserve of energy that won't easily dissipate. This strength allows me to keep going when others are gasping for breath, to maintain a steady pace when others begin to falter. 

I look at my opponents again, their faces filled with anticipation and nervous excitement. Little do they know that they stand no chance at all, for they are unaware of my greatest asset.",A,

Jessica tossed her long, blonde hair over her shoulder, glancing at her friend with a mixture of disbelief and concern. ""How can you expect not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all, Sarah?"" she questioned, eyes wide with worry. Sarah merely shrugged, a casual dismissal that sent a jolt of anxiety through Jessica.

""You're so smart, Jess. I’m sure I can borrow your notes before the test,"" Sarah said nonchalantly, leaning back on the library chair. Jessica stared back at her, the weight of her friend's careless attitude causing a crease between her eyebrows.

She loved Sarah dearly, but her consistent lack of dedication had always been a source of contention between them. ""That's not the point, Sarah."" Jessica replied, a hint of frustration seeping into her voice. ""You need to start taking your studies seriously.""

Sarah simply gave her a dismissive wave, a clear sign that she had no intention of heeding her advice. Jessica sighed deeply, closing her books and looking at her friend with disappointment, unsure of how to make Sarah understand the importance of studying.
B. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
C. Victor always believed that actors simply got paid for doing practically nothing. In his eyes, acting was a trivial pursuit, devoid of complexity or depth. After all, it was just pretending to be someone else, nothing more. However, everything changed when he decided to join a local theater class on a whim. 

On his first day in class, Victor quickly realised he was out of his depth. The passion his classmates exhibited was palpitous and the seriousness with which they approached their roles took him aback. Not only did acting demand physical stamina, but it also required immense emotional intelligence and empathetic finesse. 

Then came his turn to perform. The stage seemed to loom above him as he struggled to remember his lines and movements. Each word he spoke, every movement he made felt awkward and artificial. He could feel a disconnection between himself and the character he was supposed to portray, the narrative he was to weave. It was in that moment Victor understood that acting wasn’t as easy or as useless as he had originally thought. It was a craft that demanded hard work, dedication, and an ability to immerse oneself in another world.

For years, my friend Joseph had been a successful stockbroker, his life characterized by a luxury high-rise apartment, fancy cars, and expensive vacations. However, the economy's volatile behavior eventually took a devastating toll on his business. The stock market crashed, draining away most of his investments and leaving him in heavy debt. 

By that time, my friend was broke, so he had to sell his house. His luxurious lifestyle was stripped away, a stark contrast to the once affluent life he used to live. The grand, panoramic view of the city from his penthouse, once a symbol of his success, was now a reminder of his fall. His swanky sports cars were replaced by public transport and cabs, his nights filled with silent struggles rather than lavish parties. 

He was forced to move into a small, humble apartment on the city's outskirts. Despite the dire circumstances, Joseph demonstrated his strength and resilience by treating it as a temporary setback. He toiled day and night, firm in his resolve to reclaim his lost fortune, treating the sale of his house as the first step to his comeback.
B. Mary had been spending her evenings meticulously browsing through travel websites, picking out destinations she would love to visit. She dreamed of soaking up the sun on an isolated beach, or getting lost in an exotic market in some far-off land. She was just about to book a trip to the Maldives when reality sank in. A big work project was in its peak stage and she was one of the key members in her team.

Her heart sank as she started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done. Mary found herself caught between her job responsibilities and the need to give herself a break. On the one hand, the project held importance, but on the other hand, her yearning for vacation grew more intense by the day.

She hesitated for a moment, her hand hovering over the 'Book Now' button. But her professional integrity pulled her back, knowing her team would struggle without her. She sighed and closed the tab, making a mental note to reward herself with the trip once the project was successfully completed.

C. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.

Mark beamed with pride, his face radiating warmth as he nodded. ""Yes, he did! Can't believe he's growing up so fast,"" he sighed, a hint of nostalgia evident in his voice. It made me realise the magnitude of his son's achievement. 

I could only imagine what a myriad of emotions Mark was going through. ""You must be filled with pride and joy,"" I suggested, acknowledging the rewarding aspects of being a parent. He laughed a hearty laugh, the sound echoing down the corridor of the school where we had our reunion.

""I am,"" he confirmed, his gaze distant as if he was already imagining his son's future. Seeing the pride in his eyes, I could imagine how gratifying it must have felt to see his child walk down the aisle to collect his diploma. Graduating from middle school was indeed a major stepping stone to greater achievements.

But, along with pride, I could see a twinge of sadness as well. Perhaps, it was the inevitable sadness a parent feels watching their child grow up, step by step, ready to face the world on their own. Yet, there was joy too, a kind of joy that only a parent can understand. A joy that comes from seeing your child succeed and become their own person. 

In the face of such paternal love, I found myself feeling inexplicably happy for Mark and his son. This was a big moment for them and I was honored to witness it. Indeed, seeing the pride and joy in my friend's eyes was enough to make my day special.",B,"C. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific conf"
195,It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam. Not everyone can pass it.,"Being accepted into the prestigious Hawthorne Institute is not an easy task. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam, a test designed to measure not only the intelligence but the perseverance and determination of the applicants. Not everyone can pass it; every year, out of hundreds of candidates, only a handful of the brightest and most determined scholars make it through.

Take the case of Amelia Jenkins, a determined and passionate student who had her eyes set on the Institute since her early childhood. Day in and day out, she would immerse herself in her studies, foregoing social events and other recreational activities. She understood that casual leisure was a luxury she couldn't afford at the moment. 

Yet, even with such intense determination and unwavering focus, Amelia found herself struggling with some of the complex problems in the entrance exam. She realized that merely studying hard would not guarantee her success; she needed to study smart as well. Adopting new strategies and methods, she started approaching the problems from a different perspective. Eventually, with her relentless effort, she managed to clear the exam, proving that while the task was indeed challenging, it was not impossible. It merely required an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, and a smart approach to problem-solving.","A. Jane has always seen things that others don't. Ever since childhood, she's been drawn to the unusual, the ordinary that's seen from an extraordinary lens. John, an average man in the eyes of the general public, caught her attention on a regular day at her usual coffee shop. He was standing behind the counter, blending with the mundane scene around him. But not for Jane.

From his ginger hair, slightly tousled, to his freckles adorning his face like constellations; everything about him was perfect to her. She saw the way his green eyes would light up when he made a good cup of coffee or the way his face crinkled up when he laughed. To her, he was a masterpiece, the embodiment of everything charming and attractive. She found herself falling for his uniqueness, his ordinariness that so many seemed to overlook.

Even though her friends saw him as nothing but an average joe, Jane cherished this man who, to her, stood out as the most attractive man in the world. Her heart fluttered every time she thought of him, every time she saw him. Because to her, he was more than just ordinary, he was extraordinary.
B. The highly anticipated opening of the local theater's newest play, ""Murder in the Manor,"" was approaching. Everything had been planned meticulously, from the intricate set designs to the finely tailored costumes. However, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play, threatening its ultimate success.

First, the star actor, known for his melodramatic portrayal of the villain, fell ill with laryngitis. His unique voice was a trademark of his performances, and without it, the play was off to a rocky start. Next, a critical prop, the ornate dagger for the climactic murder scene, was mysteriously lost. The team had searched everywhere but to no avail. 

As if matters couldn't get worse, a fire broke out in the costume room, causing damage to several important pieces. Then, the heavy, antique chandelier, a vital part of the set, crashed onto the stage during a rehearsal, narrowly missing the stand-ins. Furthermore, incessant rainfall led to a leak in the theatre's roof, flooding the orchestra pit.

Despite these setbacks, the determined cast and crew soldiered on, refusing to let their hard work go to waste. Their resilience in the face of adversity was a testament to their passion for the theater. After all, the show must go on.
C. As the sun began to peek over the horizon, I turned to my wife and declared, ""To secure the best batch, let's go to the farmer's market early as the remaining options may not be as favorable."" She agreed, as she too craved the freshest, ripest fruits and vegetables for our kitchen. We prepared swiftly, eager to encounter the magic that the early morning market held.

Upon reaching the bustling farmer's market, we could immediately see the array of farm-fresh produce, handmade crafts, and baked goods on display. We headed first to Mr. Johnson's stall, knowing that he brings the juiciest apples and the crunchiest lettuce. Early birds like us got the finest picks, much better than the wilted leftovers during the noon rush.

Next, we scurried towards Mrs. Peters' bakery stand, the aroma of her freshly baked bread filling the air. Again, arriving early gave us the advantage of getting the warm, soft loaves, just out of the oven. As the day wore on, Mrs. Peter's beautiful pastries would disappear, leaving only a few less desirable choices.

Finally, with our bags brimming with the best produce and goods the market offered, we returned home satisfied. Arriving at the farmer's market early was indeed the key to securing the best batch. As the morning sun began to climb higher, we started preparing our meals, knowing that we had the freshest ingredients, thanks to our early morning adventure.
D. On a typical weekday morning, Tom woke up and thought of a new challenge - he decided to drive to his office for the first time. Having only recently acquired his driving license, Tom was eager to flaunt his new skill. Looking out the window, he saw the bustle of the city roads, and naively thought, ""It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic."" 

As he got into his car, a sense of determination flooded him. He started his journey, but very soon was submerged into the chaotic labyrinth of urban traffic. Cars of all sizes were trying to outsmart each other, trying to find any room possible to pass through. The honking horns and the frequent brake lights turned his simple morning drive into a nerve-racking test. 

An hour passed in what seemed like an eternity, and Tom found himself only halfway to his destination. He then realized the truth of the common saying, ""Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos."" Wiping the sweat off his brow, Tom quietly admired those who braved these roads daily. He understood that driving wasn't just about controlling the steering wheel, but it also required adaptability and a lot of patience. He decided then and there that he needed more practice before he could join the ranks of those seasoned drivers.",D,"#1: A.

196,"I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.","My heart skips a beat every time I imagine myself skydiving. The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.","A. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
B. My sister, Emily, has a deeply ingrained fear of the dark that traces back to our childhood. As children, we would share ghost stories late at night, and Emily would always end up shaken, her imagination running wild. She was so petrified that she always left the hallway light on before going to sleep, casting a faint glow into her room. It was her way of dealing with the fear of what lurked in the darkness. 

But as we grew older, Emily decided that she could no longer allow her fear to dictate her life. She often spoke of her desire to one day sleep in a completely dark room, without the safety of the light from the hallway. It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.
C. Sarah had always been a very self-critical person. After each job interview, she'd sit in her car replaying every detail, from the way she shook the interviewer's hand, to the tone in which she answered questions. She would often chastise herself for not using more impressive vocabulary or for failing to mention some minor accomplishment. ""There is no point in regretting your approach after you've had the interview,"" her older brother advised, sensing her post-interview stress.

He reminded her that, once the interview was over, she could not change anything she'd said or done. All she could do was wait for a decision. ""Move on to the next one,"" he encouraged her, further explaining that dwelling on the past would only rob her of the focus and energy needed for upcoming opportunities. 

Trying to heed his advice, Sarah started to look ahead, preparing for her next interview instead of dwelling on the past ones. She realized that she could learn from her perceived mistakes and apply those lessons in the future. Eventually, she found that this forward-thinking strategy helped alleviate her post-interview stress and made her perform better in subsequent ones. The regret was replaced by a sense of learning and personal growth, which was a far more constructive approach.
D. Ramos was a well-established author known for his profound and thought-provoking novels. Over the past months, he had been painstakingly piecing together his latest literary masterpiece. Yet, every time he tried to find the quiet focus he needed to finish his project, a string of disturbances impeded his progress.

He was unable to concentrate with the hustle and bustle of city life that invaded his quiet work space. Between the phone ringing off the hook and constant knocks at his door, peace was a luxury he couldn't afford. His patience waning, Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, far away from these distractions. 

He knew of an old rustic cabin located in the heart of a peaceful forest. The cabin was devoid of any signs of modern life - no phone, no internet, no television. It was his sanctuary, a place where he could shut out the world and dive deep into his imagination. So, he packed his essentials, manuscripts in tow, and headed to the cabin where no one could disturb him.",B,
197,I am afraid of walking on the streets at night but I will eventually do it one day once I start living alone.,"Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it. My heart pounding in my chest will slowly become a normal rhythm, my fear will turn into a certain caution, and my journey, a routine I follow, unfazed. The darkness won't be a cause for terror anymore. Instead, the quiet streets will make me feel independent and strong.","A. Sam had always been an introverted girl, shying away from social interactions, particularly with unfamiliar people. For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.
B. Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, lived a young artist named Alex. He was full of aspirations, with an insatiable desire for success in his artistic endeavors. One day, he got an offer from a renowned gallery to showcase his works. His old and wise mentor, Robert, was ecstatic to hear this news. 

Seeing the glittering greed in Alex's eyes, Robert cautioned, ""Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you."" He emphasized the gravity of his statement by adding, ""If you negotiate too much they might take the offer back."" Alex, blinded by his greed, dismissed Robert's wise advice as the fear of an old man.

However, his relentless negotiation with the gallery didn't go well. The gallery management, unimpressed with his unabashed greed, withdrew their offer. Alex, left with regret and an invaluable lesson, realized the wisdom in Robert's words: modesty sometimes had its rewards.
C. Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.
D. On a snowy night, in a tiny town on the edge of the world, there was a house so old, every nook and corner echoed stories of time. This house was lit only by the glow of a hundred candles; an extraordinary sight to see from the outside, creating a sparkling mirage against the backdrop of the cold white surroundings. 

However, one day a strong breeze blew through the house, extinguishing all the candles and leaving it in complete darkness. The owners of the house, an elderly couple, did not have any extra candles. ""No light can be found from an unlit candle,"" the old man muttered, feeling around in the darkness. His wife echoed his thoughts, sighing in dismay. 

Despair started to seep in when they thought of the long, cold night that awaited them. However, the old lady remembered a tiny, forgotten candle she had saved for years, tucked away in a corner. With a striking match, the last candle was lit, casting a warm glow in the room. The house had lost its grandeur for the night, but the couple was content, comforted by the small but enduring glow of their solitary candle.",A,s.

Sally had always been the type to avoid strenuous physical activity; she had never stepped foot in a gym. Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears. She finally committed and announced with newfound determination that she would start going to the gym soon.
B. For years, Jeffrey had been known as the night owl of the family. Often, he would find himself engrossed in a book or a movie well past midnight. ""If you don't go to sleep early, you will wake up late,"" his mother warned him constantly. But Jeffrey, engrossed in his activities, would simply nod and continue. 

The impending consequence of his actions was always in the back of his mind, but he never really gave it much importance. However, one day, he received an important job interview that was scheduled for early in the morning. He stayed up late the night before out of excitement and anxiety. 

The next day, as his mother had predicted, he woke up late. He rushed to get ready, but the interview had already started by the time he arrived. Jeffrey learnt the hard way the truth of the old saying: ""As you sow, so shall you reap."" Now, he makes sure to get a good night's rest every day.
C. Max, my pet dog, is an energetic and playful soul. He has a great fondness for games, with his favorite being frisbee. Our routine was the same every day; as soon as I would get back from work, we would head straight to the park. This park, just a few blocks away, was Max's paradise.

Today was no different; we spent the whole day running around, chasing and tossing the frisbee under the warm sun. Max was the star of the park, darting around like a whirlwind with his bright red frisbee. He would leap into the air, trying to snatch the frisbee before it touched the ground, displaying his athleticism and enthusiasm.

As the sun began to set, we started our walk back home. The whole day of energetic play was evident on Max; he was panting hard but had an unmistakable gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Now, after a long day full of fun and games, my pet dog Max is down for the count, snoring softly in his corner, probably dreaming about another day full of frisbee fun.

It was an antique vase passed down in her family for generations, and you had accidentally knocked it off the table while cleaning. Its pieces were now concealed in your closet, hidden beneath piles of old clothes. Each day that passed made you feel more and more guilty about your deceit. 

Your friend, Mike, had been aware of your dilemma since the day of the accident. He insisted you should tell your mother the truth about the vase, as it would relieve you of the stress. He reminded you about how understanding and forgiving your mother usually was. After several days of persuasion, you finally agreed with him.

Whenever the topic of computers or technology came up, he would always wave it off, saying it was too daunting for him. He found the idea of delving into the labyrinth of code to create a functioning computer program particularly intimidating. This avoidance of technology was surprising since Frank was always up for challenges in other areas of his life.

Then, something unusual happened the last time we met. Frank surprised everyone by proclaiming that he was finally ready to conquer his fear of technology. He confidently announced that he would attempt to write his first computer program. The proclamation came out of nowhere, catching everyone, including me, off guard.

We had all gotten used to Frank's refusal to dip his toes in the world of technology, so this sudden shift was undoubtedly unexpected.

C. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
D. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend.

It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.","A. Sam had always been an introverted girl, shying away from social interactions, particularly with unfamiliar people. For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.
B. In this part of town, hidden away behind the bustling city life, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes. These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.
C. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
D. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.",A,"# A

201,"Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.","Sally had always been the type to avoid strenuous physical activity; she had never stepped foot in a gym. Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears. She finally committed and announced with newfound determination that she would start going to the gym soon.","A. Frank, my old buddy from college, has always been somewhat technophobic. Whenever the topic of computers or technology came up, he would always wave it off, saying it was too daunting for him. He found the idea of delving into the labyrinth of code to create a functioning computer program particularly intimidating. This avoidance of technology was surprising since Frank was always up for challenges in other areas of his life.

Then, something unusual happened the last time we met. Frank surprised everyone by proclaiming that he was finally ready to conquer his fear of technology. He confidently announced that he would attempt to write his first computer program. The proclamation came out of nowhere, catching everyone, including me, off guard.

We had all gotten used to Frank's refusal to dip his toes in the world of technology, so this sudden shift was undoubtedly unexpected. However, it was also encouraging to see him willing to step out of his comfort zone. Frank's decision marked a new chapter in his life, and we were all eager to see how this turn of events would unfold.
B. Every evening, as the sun dips below the horizon, a particular ritual unfolds near our home. Many drinkers, drawn to their local sanctuary of libations, converge on a quaint little bar tucked away on the corner of our street. The bar, an inviting oasis of warmth and camaraderie, stands as a beacon for the weary, its neon sign flickering against the encroaching darkness.

You know, there's something almost poetic about the whole thing, the manner in which these like-minded individuals gather. It brings to mind the old adage, ""Birds of a feather flock together."" Perhaps for them, this nightly assembly offers an escape, a familiar comfort in shared experiences and quiet camaraderie.

They laugh, they bicker, they share stories from days long past or hopes of better tomorrows. Each one, despite their diverse backgrounds, connected by an invisible thread of shared comfort and routine. The clinking of glasses, the hum of conversation, it all forms an intoxicating symphony of life in its most raw and unfiltered form.

Yes, every evening, just as surely as the sun retreats to make way for the moon, many drinkers get together in that small bar near our home. Because, after all, birds of a feather really do flock together.
C. John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.
D. In the small town of Baker's Crest, people lived simple lives, mostly untouched by the allure of wealth and luxury. The quiet town was buzzing one day with the news of a travelling merchant who claimed to sell ""real gold"" artifacts. The townspeople gathered at the market square, attracted by the glinting objects displayed on his cart. 

The items glittered under the sunlight, their sheen unmatched, making everyone believe they were indeed made of gold. The merchant, a persuasive man, told captivating tales of the artifacts being lost treasures of ancient kings. An air of greed and desire blew over the town, as everyone wanted a piece of this assumed wealth. They traded their hard-earned savings for the glittering items, believing they had struck a fortune. 

It was not until a wise old man from the town examined the artifacts closely and declared them to be mere brass, cleverly polished to resemble gold. All the glitter had indeed fooled them, reinforcing the adage, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The realization dawned, leaving the townspeople embarrassed, having learned their lesson the hard way.",A,#1234567891011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
202,"When Chris turned forty, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job for his hobbies.","On the day Chris blew out the candles on his 40th birthday cake, he had an epiphany. The monotonous life he was living as a software engineer began to feel too dull for his liking. A life filled with deadlines, alarm clocks, and office politics had left him feeling disillusioned. He yearned for the thrill and spontaneity that he had once enjoyed in his youth. And so, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job to pursue his hobbies.

Motorcycle racing and photography, both long forgotten passions, began to call out to him. The very next day, he handed in his resignation, allowing a sense of liberation to sweep over him. With his savings, he bought a brand new motorcycle and a professional camera. Every day was now an adventure, the open road and the perfect shot his new routine. Amidst the deafening sound of the motorcycle engine and the constant click of his camera, Chris found the joy that he had been searching for, redefining his life's purpose.","A. In the heart of a cozy, rustic kitchen sat a pot-bellied, old-fashioned stove. It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.
B. Every day when she woke up, Jennifer looked through her window and admired her neighbor's home. She thought it was more attractive than her own whenever she turned to look at it. It was a resplendent Victorian mansion with an abundance of gables, a porch that wrapped around the entire front, and immaculate, manicured hedges that lined the driveway. There were vibrantly colored flowers placed expertly throughout the garden, and the white picket fence added an element of charm that she felt her own home lacked.

Jennifer's house, a modest bungalow, was far from unappealing, but paled in comparison to her neighbor's palatial abode. She spent countless hours fussing over her humble garden and undertaking DIY projects to make her home look more like the one across the street. Yet her efforts seemed to fall short every time.

One day, Jennifer struck up a conversation with her neighbor, Ms. Hawthorne. The older woman shared that the upkeep of her lavish home was quite demanding, requiring daily maintenance, considerable expenditure, and constant attention to detail. In that moment, Jennifer realized that while the neighbor's home may have been more attractive, it was certainly more difficult to keep up. She learned to appreciate her own home's charm, realizing its lower maintenance was a blessing in disguise.
C. Once upon a time, there was a woman named Sara who worked tirelessly in a corporate cubicle day in and day out. She had been in the same position for a decade and the monotonous routine of her job had begun to wear her down. Each day was an exact replica of the previous one with the same old meetings, deadlines, and reports. She felt bored and tired, slowly losing her enthusiasm and zest.

One gloomy Monday, she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen, her heart filling with despair. It was then that she decided she couldn't do it anymore. Sara decided to break free from the chains of her dull job and pursue her passion for cooking. She saved her money and quit her job, leaving the corporate world behind.

She pooled all her resources and took a leap of faith to open up her own restaurant. With love, she chose every detail, from the menu to the decor. Finally, in her own bustling restaurant, she found her happiness and sense of fulfillment she had been longing for.
D. Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.",C,"s 3.14. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.

203,"After years of working as a lawyer, Smith decided to quit and open a youtube channel for his singing videos.","After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.","A. In the bustling state capital, politicians fervently debated the latest budget proposal. Part of the state budget, they realized, comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package. This spending package, while beneficial for some areas, sparked controversy nationwide due to its allocation towards controversial projects.

Governor Thompson, a seasoned politician, was troubled by this reality. He was aware of the constituents' growing concerns about accepting funds from a package that many of them fundamentally disagreed with. However, he also understood the dire need for financial resources in several underfunded areas within the state.

During a highly publicized town hall meeting, he addressed the issue head-on. He tried to explain the intricate balance of economics and politics involved in budget decisions. Many left the meeting still disgruntled, but a few seemed to appreciate the governor's honesty.

Thompson knew it was only the beginning of a long journey. Accepting the funds meant the ability to kick start much-needed initiatives in the state, but it also meant negotiating a delicate political landscape. He understood that as a leader, he had to face these difficult decisions, trying to serve his state's best interests amidst a sea of discord.
B. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
C. The much-anticipated Friday afternoon had finally arrived, and to my pleasant surprise, I had no homework assigned for the weekend. I could feel a strange sense of freedom as I stepped off the school bus and took the familiar path to our house. Suddenly, the thought of having nothing to do turned into an exciting idea - I decided I'd devote the whole weekend to annoying my older brother, Jacob. Jacob was the typical older sibling, always bossy and never missing a chance to tease me.

I began crafting a meticulous plan, fueled by previous unsuccessful attempts to get back at him. My mind began to bubble with ideas - switching his toothpaste with mayonnaise, short-sheeting his bed, pretending to sneak up on him with a plastic spider. I carefully spent the entire Saturday preparing everything, secretly grinning to myself.

Sunday morning arrived, and I was all set to implement my genius plan. First, I woke up early and switched his toothpaste, trying my best to suppress my laughter as I imagined his reaction. As the day progressed, I was enjoying each of his bewildered reactions. By the end of the weekend, I had successfully pulled off all my tricks and enjoyed an entire weekend of hilarity at my brother's expense.
D. After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred.

In the heart of the warm, comforting living room, a scene of serenity unfolded. A baby was nestled securely in a plush, patchwork blanket, resting peacefully next to her mother. This was not just any blanket; it was a token from her grandmother, each stitched square telling a unique story of family heritage and love. The baby, despite being unaware of the tales woven into the fabric, felt the warmth and safety it radiated. 

She lay there, her tiny fingers curled up around her mother's shirt, her soft breaths rising and falling rhythmically. She was as snug as a bug in a rug, a picture of innocent bliss.

C. A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.
D. Philip was a dedicated software engineer, a genius in his own right, engrossed in a challenging project. It was a complicated task that required immense concentration and his complete attention. Thus, Philip decided he needed to dedicate an entire day solely to this project, eliminating all potential distractions.

Before plunging into his work, he looked around at his desk cluttered with a multitude of devices, each pinging with notifications and reminders. Aware of their tempting, disruptive potential, he resolved to turn every single one of them off, a decision he rarely made. He powered down his smartphone, tablet, and even his smartwatch, silencing all of his digital diversions. A feeling of silence enveloped him, which was alien yet oddly comforting.

With the distractions abated, Philip found himself entirely in the zone, solving complex coding problems he had previously found insurmountable. The day stretched into evening, and Philip remained engrossed in his work, only pausing for the briefest of breaks. By the time the moon was high in the sky, Philip finally sat back, satisfied.

Every day for weeks, she would wake up before sunrise and go to sleep way past midnight. Her mind constantly buzzed with deadlines, strategies, and implementations. While she loved her work, the intensity of this project started to take a toll on her mental and physical well-being.

Her face became gaunt, dark circles took permanent residency under her eyes, and her once jovem spirit started to feel weary. She could see her performance declining, mistakes slipping in her work that she would have never made before. The realization hit her hard; she was severely exhausted.

Something had to change. Thus, she decided to take a break and prioritize her health. She requested a month off work, packed her favorite books and clothes, and flew to a tropical island for a well-deserved vacation to rejuvenate herself.","A. I'm a firm believer in the importance of a good work-life balance. However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question. But despite the exhaustion, I managed to meet each and every deadline, proving to myself that sometimes, bending the rules of work-life balance is necessary for success.

C. Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.
D. My mother, a renowned psychiatrist, had an important conference to prepare for. The conference was a significant event in her career, an opportunity to showcase her research on ""Effective Mental Health Interventions for Youth."" As much as she loved us, her kids, her dedication to her work and to mental health awareness was resolute. In the coming weeks, her focus was more intense than I had ever seen before.

Ever since our father passed away, my brother and I had unwittingly become a bit too needy. We missed him terribly, and our need for attention often manifested as day to day rants and petty fights. But for the moment, with her conference looming, our mother could not indulge us.

""You boys will have to sort your quarrels out yourselves,"" she said with an apologetic smile, her gaze already back on the piles of research papers.

As she immersed herself in her work, my brother and I, at loose ends, were forced to deal with our feelings on our own. In the process, we discovered we had more in common than we thought, including a shared admiration for our mother’s dedication. Perhaps her refusal to entertain our day to day rants and fights wasn’t such a bad thing after all.",B,"s

206,"Post graduation, Emily decided to not go for any jobs but instead chose to travel and paint for enjoyment.","After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred. She had earned her freedom after years of laborious study and now was the time to enjoy it. The thought of experiencing new cultures and translating them onto her canvas excited Emily more than any high-paying job could ever do.","A. John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence. It is a painful reality that he is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.
B. At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.
C. Sam had always been an introverted girl, shying away from social interactions, particularly with unfamiliar people. For as long as she could remember, she had harbored a fear of speaking to strangers. The mere thought of starting a conversation with someone she didn’t know was enough to make her palms sweat and her heart race.

However, Sam's life had been changing recently. She had started a new job at a bustling multinational firm that frequently required her to interact with unfamiliar faces. She knew that in order to succeed and grow in this environment, she would have to overcome her fear. But the mere thought of it made her stomach knot with anxiety.

One day, she sat quietly in her room, pondering over her dilemma. She knew she had to take a step towards overcoming her fear; she needed to build up the courage and try speaking to strangers. She took a deep breath, straightened her back and decided to start small, perhaps by saying hello to a new colleague at work the next day.

With a new-found determination in her eyes, Sam felt slightly less terrified. She knew it would be a long journey, but she was willing to push her boundaries. Conquering her fears wouldn't be easy, but she was hopeful that with time, she would get better at it.
D. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
207,"When he finally started earning after years of struggle, Alex spent all his money on drinks and parties as he wanted to enjoy his life now.","Alex had always been a hard worker. He had spent most of his adult life working low-paying jobs, scrimping and saving every penny to get by. He would see his friends enjoying their life with grand parties and expensive drinks, but he could only dream of such extravagances. 

One day, he was finally able to secure a high-paying job after years of struggle and dedication. The feeling was surreal, it felt like a weight lifted off his shoulders. For Alex, it was more than just earning money, it was about finally being able to afford the life he wanted. 

As he received his first paycheck, he decided to treat himself. Without wasting any time, he spent all his money on drinks and parties. He invited all his friends and enjoyed to the fullest, living the life he had yearned for so long. Alex wanted to relish this newfound freedom, to enjoy his life now without any restrictions. After all, he felt he had earned it after years of hard work and struggle.","A. John was always one to take risks. His adrenaline-pumping adventures ranged from skydiving to deep-sea diving. Yet, the most thrilling adventure for him was the stock market. The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket."" John took the advice to heart, and rather than rushing into one venture, he wisely decided to spread his investments, realizing the importance of not betting everything on a single possibility.
B. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.
C. Jessica tossed her long, blonde hair over her shoulder, glancing at her friend with a mixture of disbelief and concern. ""How can you expect not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all, Sarah?"" she questioned, eyes wide with worry. Sarah merely shrugged, a casual dismissal that sent a jolt of anxiety through Jessica.

""You're so smart, Jess. I’m sure I can borrow your notes before the test,"" Sarah said nonchalantly, leaning back on the library chair. Jessica stared back at her, the weight of her friend's careless attitude causing a crease between her eyebrows.

She loved Sarah dearly, but her consistent lack of dedication had always been a source of contention between them. ""That's not the point, Sarah."" Jessica replied, a hint of frustration seeping into her voice. ""You need to start taking your studies seriously.""

Sarah simply gave her a dismissive wave, a clear sign that she had no intention of heeding her advice. Jessica sighed deeply, closing her books and looking at her friend with disappointment, unsure of how to make Sarah understand the importance of studying.

208,The baby looks as snug as a bug in a rug next to her mother.,"In the heart of the warm, comforting living room, a scene of serenity unfolded. A baby was nestled securely in a plush, patchwork blanket, resting peacefully next to her mother. This was not just any blanket; it was a token from her grandmother, each stitched square telling a unique story of family heritage and love. The baby, despite being unaware of the tales woven into the fabric, felt the warmth and safety it radiated. 

She lay there, her tiny fingers curled up around her mother's shirt, her soft breaths rising and falling rhythmically. She was as snug as a bug in a rug, a picture of innocent bliss. Her mother gazed down at her with a love so vast it seemed to fill the room. The soft flicker of the fire casting gentle shadows on their peaceful figures. 

The rest of the world ceased to exist for the pair, their world momentarily reduced to this cocoon of warmth and love. This night was a precious moment etched into the canvas of their lives, a symbol of the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child.","A. From the moment I walked into the party that night, I felt an odd tension in the air. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, but something felt amiss. I brushed it off, attributing it to the slight anxiety I always had at social events. It was not until I ran into Nick, a dear friend I had known since grade school, that I realized the source of my discomfort.

We engaged in small talk, but the conversation quickly escalated into an argument, right in the middle of the party. His harsh words resonated throughout the room, the sound of laughter and music fading in the background. I stood there, shocked and humiliated as Nick unleashed a barrage of personal insults on me, for no apparent reason.

Our shared memories and the deep bond we had forged over the years instantly shattered. I felt a cold, heavy feeling settle in my heart as I walked out of the party, leaving behind a room full of murmurs and confused faces. I vowed then and there, that as much as it pained me, I cannot forgive Nick for how he insulted me that day at the party.
B. Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.
C. Harry was a dedicated young athlete with a dream; a dream to win the prestigious city marathon. All his life, he had been waiting for this moment, the moment when he could finally prove his worth to himself and to the world around him. He knew that if he wanted to win, he couldn't leave any stone unturned. He would have to prepare tirelessly for the final race, putting each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Every morning, before the sun dared to peep over the horizon, Harry would lace up his running shoes and head for the trails. He took on steep hills, rough terrains and practiced in every weather condition - rain, sunshine, and snow alike. Every drop of sweat that gushed down his face represented his dedication and hard work, only fueling his determination further. He balanced this strenuous training with a well-disciplined diet and sleep schedule.

On rest days, he visualized himself crossing the finish line first, basking in the glory of his hard work. But it wasn't just about winning anymore; the journey had taught him more about perseverance, patience, and his love for the sport. Regardless of the results, he knew that he would cherish these moments spent preparing for the final race for the rest of his life.
D. For decades, the secret police had instilled fear among the citizens of the city. They were a menacing force, relentless and ruthless, conducting their operations in the shadows. The mere thought of crossing paths with them was a nightmare. Yet, they had an individual on their radar, a man named Peter.

People thought it impossible to escape their relentless pursuit, but Peter was not ordinary. Peter, an unassuming yet resilient man, found himself caught up in their web. He was under constant surveillance, and any wrong move would have dire consequences.

One day, Peter received an anonymous tip-off about a plan to arrest him. It was then that he plotted his daring escape. Relying on his intelligence and quick thinking, Peter successfully managed to escape, narrowly avoiding their traps. The escape was far too close for comfort, giving him several heart-stopping moments, but he managed to slip away nonetheless. 

Word of Peter's daring escape spread among the citizens, igniting hope. While people had always believed it was impossible to escape from the secret police, Peter's audacious feat proved otherwise.",B,"#1 in the world.

209,Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around.,"Sally was usually a shy and introverted person. She preferred solitude to gatherings and found people tiresome. However, there was one person that Sally enjoyed being around. Sharon was her best friend, her confidant, the only person that could bring out the true Sally.

Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around. There was a certain kind of energy that Sharon carried around her; infectious, warm, and welcoming. It was something that she seemed to radiate, and it was impossible not to be drawn towards it. 

Sharon's presence would light up Sally's world, push away the shyness and anxiety. It would replace them with joy, laughter, and a level of comfort that Sally found with no one else. Their bond was a special one, a friendship that Sally would forever cherish and look forward to. It was a friendship that turned Sally's world a little less intimidating, a little less lonely, and a lot more fun.","A. Linda had always been a reserved woman, with her emotions often kept in check and concealed beneath a cordial smile. However, she was different in her own home, especially when she was around her husband, Tom. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around; her stiff exterior softens, her subtle smile widens, and her eyes brighten.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.
B. Once a darling of social media, Cynthia was known for her vivacious pictures and exciting updates. She always had a knack for creating a fascinating virtual life, which drew thousands of followers. One of the most prominent features of her Instagram was her seemingly unshakeable friendship with Mary. Their matching outfits, their Friday night pizza outings, and the signature duo selfies, all painted the perfect image of a loyal bond.

However, the true scenario was a striking contrast to the vibrant pictures posted online. In reality, Cynthia and Mary shared an utterly superficial bond. Their meet-ups were mostly marked by silence, interrupted only by the constant clicking of their phone cameras. Instead of making genuine conversations, they were more involved with capturing the best moments for their Instagram.

Their shared love for social media had somehow eclipsed the need for forming a real bond. Both had fallen prey to the attraction of the digital world, swapping meaningful friendship for a fake image. It was the irony of their bond - known as best friends online, but strangers when the screens were put away.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.
D. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.",A,D.
210,Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.,"Jimmy had spent the last few weeks fretting over his course selection for the next semester. He was a sophomore at the prestigious Canterbury University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. He had a deep interest in his field of study but deciding on what courses to take was proving to be a daunting task. The options were extensive and each course was as appealing as the other.

One afternoon, he decided to seek help and scheduled a meeting with Professor Marks. He was renowned in the University for his excellent teaching and deep knowledge of the field. Armed with a list of courses, Jimmy met with the professor. The professor's deep insight into each course, its prospects and challenges offered Jimmy a clear perspective about his choices.

By the end of the discussion, Jimmy felt less overwhelmed. He was reassured after consulting with the Professor Marks about what courses to take next semester, and he finally felt ready to take on the next step in his educational journey.","A. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.

C. The management of Harris & Smith Corp felt deflated as their rivals, Murray Enterprises, announced prematurely they had won a lucrative contract. They thought they had gained the upper hand with their clever marketing and aggressive pricing. The whispers among our team grew silent; all the work we had done, the countless overtime hours and the sleepless nights, seemed in vain. 

But I, as CEO, refused to surrender so easily. ""They think they’ve won the contract but we’ve still got a couple of ideas to win it back,"" I confidently told my dejected team. Hope sparked in their eyes as they looked at me, waiting for the strategy that could potentially overturn our fortunes. 

Firstly, we decided to emphasize on our proven track record, something Murray Enterprises lacked. We planned to present this convincingly in a last-minute pitch with the client. Secondly, we proposed a unique, value-added service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. No one knew if this would sway the client in our favor, but we were determined to do everything we could, right till the end.
D. Nina was not in the mood for distractions today, as she slipped on her headphones at her desk. Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.",B,"The following is a list of the best ways to learn how to understand how to do and how to do

211,Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.,"Frank had been all around the world, from bustling cities to desolate deserts, in pursuit of his career. A translator by profession, his work took him far and wide, away from the comfort of his small town in New Hampshire. Being a diligent and committed man, Frank invested years in adapting to diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. But, he always yearned for the familiarity and comfort of his hometown. 

One winter, after a decade overseas, Frank decided to return home. He was ecstatic as he packed his bags, each piece of clothing he folded bringing him one step closer to the solace he missed. The journey felt nostalgic as he drove through the sleepy lanes leading to his quaint wooden house. 

Finally, Frank found himself in his old room, staring at the childhood bed that bore witness to his dreams of adventure. The sight of the bed, washed in the soft, warm glow of his old table lamp, invited him with an embrace of familiarity. That night, he crawled under his worn-out quilt, and for the first time in years, Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed, surrounded by the soothing aura of his home country.","A. Garry is a content and humble man. He is employed at a local grocery store where he works diligently. Despite knowing he is underpaid compared to others in similar positions, Garry is not a man of many demands. He doesn't chase after the luxuries of life but rather is satisfied with the simple pleasures it offers. 

The thought that he is underpaid is always somewhere in the corner of his mind. Yet he willingly chooses not to focus on it. His outlook is rather optimistic. To him, having a stable job to pay his bills and live comfortably is a blessing in itself. Moreover, his work brings him a sense of purpose and satisfaction, something he values more than a hefty paycheck. Garry believes in the joy of working and being able to sustain himself, this makes him more than happy to have a job despite being underpaid.
B. In the world of politics, it's no secret that politicians frequently tell lies. This is a practice that's become so commonplace, it's almost accepted as part of the job. Yet, this deceitful behaviour often gets them into serious problems. A little white lie here or there might seem harmless in the moment, but they quickly spiral out of control and become larger scandals.

Take for instance, a fictitious candidate, Thomas Welling. He won his first term based on false promises and cleverly manipulated statistics. However, his reelection campaign was marred by the revelation of these lies. The trust of his constituents eroded and there were calls for his resignation.

The irony is, these politicians could win election after election if they would just be sincere about their aims. Voters appreciate honesty, even when it comes with unpleasant truths. A politician who isn't afraid to state their genuine aims and intentions, even when they may not be popular, tends to garner more respect and support. Authenticity can be the differentiating factor that sets one candidate apart from the others, ensuring their success in the long run. Lies might win you a single election, but sincerity and integrity are what create a lasting political career.
C. Jimmy had spent the last few weeks fretting over his course selection for the next semester. He was a sophomore at the prestigious Canterbury University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. He had a deep interest in his field of study but deciding on what courses to take was proving to be a daunting task. The options were extensive and each course was as appealing as the other.

One afternoon, he decided to seek help and scheduled a meeting with Professor Marks. He was renowned in the University for his excellent teaching and deep knowledge of the field. Armed with a list of courses, Jimmy met with the professor. The professor's deep insight into each course, its prospects and challenges offered Jimmy a clear perspective about his choices.

By the end of the discussion, Jimmy felt less overwhelmed. He was reassured after consulting with the Professor Marks about what courses to take next semester, and he finally felt ready to take on the next step in his educational journey.
D. Lily was the kind of person who was always running around trying to help others. She had an exceptional kind heart, always lending a hand, lending an ear, and giving out pieces of her heart to those in need. Her friends, family, and even sometimes strangers benefited from her tireless dedication to making people's lives better. However, Lily often neglected her own needs. 

One day, her close friend, Maria, noticed the tiredness in Lily's eyes. She was a shadow of her bubbly self, a clear indication she was drained. Maria gently reminded her, ""Lily, you can't pour from an empty cup."" 

Lily looked puzzled, so Maria explained, ""You give so much of yourself, but you can't forget to replenish your own energy."" Maria reminded Lily about the importance of self-care, of setting boundaries and ensuring her own cup was filled before she attempted to fill others. It was a lesson Lily took to heart, finally understanding that she couldn't effectively help others if she herself was running on empty.",C,", 209, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,"
212,Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him.,"Linda had always been a reserved woman, with her emotions often kept in check and concealed beneath a cordial smile. However, she was different in her own home, especially when she was around her husband, Tom. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around; her stiff exterior softens, her subtle smile widens, and her eyes brighten.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.","A. Sally was usually a shy and introverted person. She preferred solitude to gatherings and found people tiresome. However, there was one person that Sally enjoyed being around. Sharon was her best friend, her confidant, the only person that could bring out the true Sally.

Sally always gets so happy and comfortable whenever Sharon is around. There was a certain kind of energy that Sharon carried around her; infectious, warm, and welcoming. It was something that she seemed to radiate, and it was impossible not to be drawn towards it. 

Sharon's presence would light up Sally's world, push away the shyness and anxiety. It would replace them with joy, laughter, and a level of comfort that Sally found with no one else. Their bond was a special one, a friendship that Sally would forever cherish and look forward to. It was a friendship that turned Sally's world a little less intimidating, a little less lonely, and a lot more fun.
B. John was in the middle of the semester break, with time stretched out before him like an endless highway. The TV series he'd followed had ended, the books he'd wanted to read were read, and all his friends were out of town. Alone and bored, he began to stray into the territory of the past. His thoughts kept returning to Emily, his ex-girlfriend.

Emily was his first love, a blond-haired, blue-eyed siren who’d stormed into his life during his sophomore year. Everything about her was captivating - from her passion for Impressionist art to her quirky habit of mismatching socks. Unfortunately, a romantic relationship proved harder to maintain than a shared love for quirky habits, and they eventually broke up.

Despite having parted ways a year ago, he couldn't forget the sparkle in her eyes and her infectious laughter. He spent his idle hours rummaging through old photos and shared memories, reliving their blissful moments. Was he still in love with her, he pondered, or was he simply a prisoner to nostalgia?

His break had turned into an obsession over his previous girlfriend. As the days progressed, he realized he needed to break free from the past and began to look for new hobbies and activities to distract himself. He knew it would take time to move on, but he was determined to make the most of his present without being haunted by his past.
C. Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly. The desire for a peaceful weekend had turned into a week of disgruntled students and additional work.
D. After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.",A,C.
213,Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.,"Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.","A. I have always been one to admire bold, vibrant colours. Deep reds, cobalt blues and vibrant oranges that make a statement, that catch your eye even from afar. You, on the other hand, decided to get a soft muted beige car, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.

""I don’t really like the colour of your car,"" I remember saying to you one sunny afternoon, as we sat on the porch, sipping on homemade lemonade. I even pointed to your car, parked at the curb, as if you didn't know which one I was referring to.

You laughed, a soft chuckle that had me smirking, before setting down your glass on the table. ""I figured as much,"" you responded, a teasing glint in your eyes. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.""

I had to concede, knowing you had a point. After all, you were always drawn to the softer, subtler things in life, that found beauty in simplicity, and it was one of the many reasons I adored you. So although I may not have agreed with your choice of car colour, I could still appreciate why you chose it. It was, after all, very you.
B. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.

At first, Lena thought about confronting him. Yet she knew well enough that he would dismiss her instantly, putting her and her family in financial hardship. Therefore, she decided to play it cool, pretending like she knew nothing, all the while gathering evidence to back her up.

The boss, on the other hand, remained oblivious to her newfound knowledge. He continued conducting his shady business, confident that no one could touch him.

214,"He always argues on the silliest topics, it’s like he can’t see the wood for the trees.","John had always had a habit of arguing on the silliest topics. From the best way to fold socks to the correct angle to cut a sandwich, he always had a contrary opinion. It was as if he simply could not resist engaging in trivial disputes, the pettier the better. One day, his colleagues decided to test just how dedicated he was to his habit, so they began a debate over the color of the paperclips they used in the office.

John immediately entered into a fierce argument, insisting that red paperclips were superior in every way. His colleagues watched in bemusement as he railed on about the psychology of color and how red represented power and determination. Meanwhile, an important deadline was looming and work was piling up around them. They tried to refocus John's attention on the mounting tasks but to no avail. 

It was like he couldn't see the wood for the trees. In his fixation with arguing over insignificant matters, John was losing sight of the bigger picture and the real issues that needed his attention.","A. In the beginning, Thomas wasn't certain of his capabilities in the field of programming. He was fascinated by the world of software development, yet felt intimidated by the intricate complexities that came with it. Algorithms and coding languages seemed like an alien language, filled with cryptic symbols and complicated frameworks.

One day, his mentor told him something that stuck with him: ""By writing simple code first, one can eventually master the art of coding complex algorithms."" Intrigued, Thomas decided to adopt this philosophy and made a gradual approach towards his learning. Instead of jumping straight into the complex coding paradigms, he started off with basic algorithms, writing simple code and familiarizing himself with the programming syntax. 

Over time, as his coding skills improved, Thomas began writing slightly more complicated code. With each passing day, he was becoming more and more adept at coding. Eventually, he found himself tackling complex algorithms with ease, his fear and anxiety replaced by confidence and determination. It turned out his mentor's advice was correct; starting with simple code was the key to eventually mastering the art of complex algorithm coding.
B. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
C. Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack, a highly esteemed entrepreneur in town. He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.
D. Rebecca has always prided herself on her perceptiveness. A gift she inherited from her mom, it was as if she had a sixth sense when it came to reading people. She could discern truth from untruth in a heartbeat. This ability became a source of torment when she met Mark, a charming yet evasive man who had now become her boyfriend. 

From the moment they started dating, Rebecca sensed Mark was a complex puzzle; a man with secrets. She would catch him in small lies, minor details that didn't add up, contradictions in his past experiences, and the most alarming of all, his conveniently forgotten promises. Her instinct was screaming that he was lying to her, but Rebecca was conflicted.

Despite all of it, Rebecca loved Mark; he was sweet, caring, and made her feel cherished. Though she was aware of her boyfriend's deception, she decided to turn a blind eye. She chose to love him for his positives and let the shadows of his dishonesty lurk unnoticed, at least for now.",B,"```

215,The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.,"Congressman Bernard Foster was an ambitious man, driven by his desire to bring about effective change in his beloved state. For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.","A. In the quaint village of Anandpur nestled in the Himalayas, there lived a wise guru named Raghavendra. He was a renowned scholar, known far and wide for his wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual guidance. Word spread about Raghavendra's teachings and soon, students from all over the country began arriving to learn from him. Many students came to study under the guru, looking to gain enlightenment and pursue wisdom.

Among those students was a humble boy named Rohit, who had walked for days from his distant village to reach Anandpur. A thirst for knowledge had driven Rohit to undertake this journey. His village's elders had spoken highly of Raghavendra, painting him as a beacon of wisdom. Intrigued and eager, Rohit was one of the many who sought Raghavendra's tutelage.

These students, including Rohit, would sit attentively around Raghavendra, captivated by his teachings and stories. As they absorbed his wisdom, they started to comprehend the complexities of life. Despite hailing from different walks of life, the students formed a cohesive bond under Raghavendra's stewardship, embarking on a shared journey of spiritual and intellectual growth.

C. Jane, a seasoned executive at the corporate law firm, saw worry etched on the face of Jill, a newly hired intern. Jill had messed up an important client's paperwork and was afraid of the consequences. Jane, noticing Jill's distress, decided to step in and offer her some advice.

""Jill, everyone makes mistakes, it's an inevitable part of growth,"" Jane started, looking at Jill's anxious expression. ""The critical thing is how you handle it afterwards,"" Jane continued, her words slow and thoughtful. Jill seemed to be listening, her intense gaze fixed on Jane.

""Once you own up to your mistake, you'll feel better,"" Jane advised, her voice steady and sure. ""Hiding it or ignoring it will just add to your stress. Plus, taking responsibility reflects your sincerity and dedication.""

D. Ralph has always been a detail-oriented person, but this current project of ours seemed to magnify this trait to an annoying level. We bought this old, dilapidated house on the countryside with the intention of renovating it completely. It was a huge project that required the utmost attention to every room, every nook and cranny. Despite the enormity of the task, his attention was bizarrely drawn to one particular doorknob.

This was not an ordinary doorknob, but an antique, rusted one which was hanging onto the main entrance door of our project house. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture. It confounds me how he can lose himself in the intricacies of the tarnished brass detail while ignoring the bigger tasks at hand. 

Rooms needed painting, floorboards needed replacing, and the roof definitely needed some serious work. Yet here was Ralph, consumed with researching how to restore a singular, century-old doorknob.

When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
B. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.
C. We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.
D. At the monthly corporate meeting, the management sat across a large polished table, their faces stern and resolute. They had assembled to address the employees about the drastic changes about to take place in the company. The air in the room was fraught with tension as the management finally began to speak. 

""We value your dedication and effort,"" they began, ""but the market scenario is drastically changing and we need to adapt."" Their tone was firm, a clear indication of the seriousness of the situation. They continued, ""To survive, we've outlined some new policies which will require significant adjustment from everyone."" 

The employees glanced at each other, uncertainty etched on their faces. The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go. The words hung heavy in the room; the ultimatum had been delivered with a stark finality.

217,"The way the book is written, I get distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice and can't learn anything from it.","Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.","A. As an engineering student, I had gotten used to unexpected challenges and pressure. Yet, I was not prepared for what happened during our final semester. My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.
B. As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.
C. Harry was a dedicated young athlete with a dream; a dream to win the prestigious city marathon. All his life, he had been waiting for this moment, the moment when he could finally prove his worth to himself and to the world around him. He knew that if he wanted to win, he couldn't leave any stone unturned. He would have to prepare tirelessly for the final race, putting each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Every morning, before the sun dared to peep over the horizon, Harry would lace up his running shoes and head for the trails. He took on steep hills, rough terrains and practiced in every weather condition - rain, sunshine, and snow alike. Every drop of sweat that gushed down his face represented his dedication and hard work, only fueling his determination further. He balanced this strenuous training with a well-disciplined diet and sleep schedule.

On rest days, he visualized himself crossing the finish line first, basking in the glory of his hard work. But it wasn't just about winning anymore; the journey had taught him more about perseverance, patience, and his love for the sport. Regardless of the results, he knew that he would cherish these moments spent preparing for the final race for the rest of his life.
D. Congressman Bernard Foster was an ambitious man, driven by his desire to bring about effective change in his beloved state. For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.",D,"#1.

218,He is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.,"John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence. It is a painful reality that he is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.","A. After a seemingly endless week of turbulent storms, the weather finally became pleasant. The gray, heavy clouds that had been hanging low in the sky like an oppressive blanket were replaced with a soft, clean blue expanse. For days, the town had been relentlessly pounded by rain, lightning tearing through the skies with a fury that sent shivers down one's spine. The wind had shrieked, howling like a banshee as it tore through the deserted streets, ripping leaves from the trees.

The townspeople had huddled inside their homes, watching nervously as the rain pelted against the windows, hoping the storm would soon pass. Children had been kept indoors, their laughter and joy missed in the quiet town. It was a week that many thought would never end, yet it did. Finally, the storm retreated, leaving behind a calmness that was almost surreal.

Sunlight poured down from the cloudless sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the town. The streets were filled with laughter and joy once more, as children dashed outside, thrilled to be free of the gloominess. The weather had finally become pleasant following the stormy week, leaving a sense of peace and relief that hung heavy in the air.
B. Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.
C. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
D. Mary had been spending her evenings meticulously browsing through travel websites, picking out destinations she would love to visit. She dreamed of soaking up the sun on an isolated beach, or getting lost in an exotic market in some far-off land. She was just about to book a trip to the Maldives when reality sank in. A big work project was in its peak stage and she was one of the key members in her team.

Her heart sank as she started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done. Mary found herself caught between her job responsibilities and the need to give herself a break. On the one hand, the project held importance, but on the other hand, her yearning for vacation grew more intense by the day.

She hesitated for a moment, her hand hovering over the 'Book Now' button. But her professional integrity pulled her back, knowing her team would struggle without her.

Amy was well-aware of the ticking clock, yet she was still miles away from completing her assigned homework. As the time continued to slip from her hands, she started to feel a surge of panic. Unable to finish the task on time, she pondered over her possible options. Among her choices was an old cliché: the classic ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. She knew it was a bold lie, her pet was an ageing Labrador, Bailey, who barely had the energy to play fetch, let alone eat her paperwork.

Despite her awareness of how false it sounded, Amy decided to pitch this excuse to her professor. She stood in front of him, putting on an expression of sorrow and disappointment. ""Professor,"" she started, ""my dog ate my homework."" 

However, her professor, a seasoned educator with years of experience, was not convinced. He looked at her through his spectacles and decided to penalize her for not only failing to submit the work on time, but also for attempting to deceive him. Amy learned her lesson that day: excuses, especially the ludicrous ones, seldom save the day.

C. The tension between Emma and Ethan was palpable. They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.
D. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.",B,#C

He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.","A.

""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" I suggested to John. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear from him directly.""

John agreed and we both took the short walk to Mr. Thompson's house, a semi-detached property that had seen better days. Knocking on the door, we were greeted by a man in his sixties, seemingly calm despite his ordeal. He invited us in, offering us a weak smile as he served us cups of lukewarm tea.

We sat in his surprisingly orderly living room, full of anticipation. He began sharing his experience, his voice trembling as he remembered the incident. Each detail was more thrilling than the next - from how he discovered his missing possessions, to his first glimpse of the security footage revealing the burglar's masked face. Though we felt empathy for Mr. Thompson's loss, we couldn't hide our excitement at living a real life mystery. It was indeed much more thrilling hearing it from the victim himself.
B. Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it. Larry's keen foresight had paid off, leaving him with not just a house, but a treasure trove.

D. Nestled in the heart of the city was an exquisite Michelin-star restaurant, Le Gourmet, which had developed a reputation for attracting a surprisingly homogeneous clientele. Every evening, the restaurant would be thrumming with an assortment of well-heeled individuals, all seemingly cut from the same cloth. The patrons were so strikingly similar, it was like the restaurant had a dress code and an age restriction.

The majority of them would arrive adorned in the latest designer attire, reflecting their devotion to fashion. The women dripped with pearls and diamonds and the men donned bespoke suits, with signature timepieces ticking away at their wrists. The guests all appeared to be in their late 40s to early 50s, a sea of silver and salt-and-pepper head, exuding an air of sophistication and success.

Curious onlookers would often watch them from a distance, marveling at their uniformity, and speculating about the demographic the restaurant seemed to draw. Conversations on the sidewalk would be peppered with wild theories - ""Perhaps it's a secret society,"" a passerby would joke. Regardless of the reason, the distinctive clientele added a layer of intrigue and elegance to the restaurant's already esteemed reputation.

In the world of gastronomy, where uniqueness is the gold standard, it was ironic that Le Gourmet's patrons appeared remarkably alike.

In this part of town, hidden away behind the bustling city life, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes. These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.
B. John and his wife, Liza, had long awaited the arrival of a little one. Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

Liza would often find him sitting quietly in the room, staring at the beautifully painted walls with a distant look in his eyes. But no matter what the adoption agency's decision turned out to be, John was determined that the room would not go in vain, it would be a sanctuary of hope, a testament to their love and longing for a child.
C. Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.

222,I want to attend the lecture as it will be delivered straight from the pioneer of the subject.,"As an ardent lover of astronomy, the announcement about an upcoming lecture caught my attention immediately. The word that stood out was 'pioneer'. The lecture was going to be delivered by none other than Professor John Abrams, the renowned pioneer in the field of quantum astronomy.

I couldn't believe my luck; Abrams was a living legend! His theories had radically changed the way humanity perceived the universe and our place within it. The chance to listen to him speaking on his most recent research was something I couldn't pass up, and I knew I wanted to attend the lecture.

The thought of him explaining his concepts, straight from his perspective, was thrilling. His insights, his deductions and the way he connected dots across the universe were incredibly unique. I imagined how enriched I would feel after listening to his wisdom, deciphering the universe through his lens.

In my excitement, I promptly set a reminder to buy the tickets first thing in the morning. The opportunity to be a part of an intellectual exchange with the pioneer himself was too enticing. This was not just a lecture, but a chance to delve deeper into the subject I loved, straight from the man who had revolutionized it. I was buzzing with anticipation, eagerly waiting for the day to arrive.","A. Sally, a bubbly and cheerful seven-year-old, owns a pet dog named Buddy. Buddy, a golden retriever, had the most affectionate brown eyes and a fluffy tail that never ceased to wiggle. Ever since Sally's family brought Buddy home, the young girl noticed something peculiar about her pet's behavior. It was Buddy's fondness for her father that intrigued Sally. 

Most days, when Sally's father would arrive home from work, Buddy's joy would be unparalleled. His tail would go into a constant wagging frenzy and he would restlessly wait at the door until Sally's father entered. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Buddy would jump with joy and sit right next to him on the couch, his tail never ceasing its happy dance. 

Sally often felt a twinge of jealousy at how Buddy showed favoritism towards her father. But then she also found it endearing, how her quiet and reserved father seemed to loosen up around Buddy. Nonetheless, it still warmed Sally's heart to see the bond between her father and Buddy; after all, the dog brought happiness into their family, and that was all she could ask for.
B. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.
C. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
D. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.",D,"```

223,Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details.,"James leaned back in his chair, gently gesturing toward Mike, who sat across the room, nursing a cup of coffee. ""Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details,"" he suggested, his eyes flickering with empathy towards his friend. 

Everyone's attention turned to Mike, who was staring blankly into his cup. He looked up, surprised at first but then realizing he had a captive audience. A mild hush fell over the room, the air filled with anticipation and curiosity. 

Drawing a long breath, he began recounting the events of that fateful day. ""I still remember, it was a crisp autumn morning,"" he began, setting the mood, his words echoing in the silent room. His voice quivered slightly as he shared the horrifying experience he had with a home intruder the previous week. 

He described the paralyzing fear, the life-threatening confrontation and the relief when the police finally arrived. The room remained silent as the details unfolded, everyone listening attentively, taking in the raw and honest account of his ordeal. His story filled the room with a palpable tension, the listeners sympathetically sharing his fear, his struggle, and ultimately, his relief.","A. Fred was a crafty man, renowned for his sharp mind and razor-like wit. He was a natural wheeler and dealer, with an uncanny knack for exploiting opportunities. Unfortunately, these opportunities were often at the expense of others, for Fred made his wealth by swindling innocent people out of their hard-earned money.

For years, Fred's empires were built on deceit and treachery, promising wealth and prosperity to those who could hardly afford to lose. He lived lavishly, often seen with the most expensive suits, the fastest cars, and the most beautiful companions. His immense fortune was the talk of the town, admired by many and despised by the ones he tricked.

However, Fred's life took a drastic turn when he became the target of his own game. A man as clever and ruthless as he was approached him with an irresistible business deal. Fred, always hungry for more, didn't notice the glaring red flags and invested his entire wealth into the venture.

But the deal was a sham, designed meticulously to strip Fred of his immense fortune. He lost it all in the blink of an eye, falling victim to the same swindling strategies he had once used. The irony was not lost on those who had suffered at his hands, and Fred was left with nothing, a poignant reminder of his deceptive past.
B. Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack, a highly esteemed entrepreneur in town. He had always taken pride in his local factory, a significant source of his wealth and fame. His factory, producing high-quality textiles, was the heart of the economy in their small town.

One day, he rushed into the local tavern, his usually neat suit covered in soot and his eyes red and welled up. ""Listen to the news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he exclaimed, capturing everyone's attention. His voice trembled as he continued, ""My factory, our lifeline, burned down right in front of my eyes.""

The tavern became silent. The townsfolk exchanged sorrowful glances, knowing full well the devastating implication of Jack's announcement. Each face reflected despair, concern about their future, and sympathy for Jack, who had lost what had once been his pride and joy.

Jack spent that night mourning his loss, feeling the weight of the future of the town on his shoulders. The next morning, he woke with a new resolve. He knew that he must rebuild, for his sake and for the town's. And although this day marked a great tragedy, he also saw it as the beginning of a new chapter.
C. We all begin our lives in the same humble manner, as innocent and inexperienced infants, new to the world and unaware of its complexities. From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.
D. Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire. Meet James Harrison, a self-made millionaire who lives in New York City. He made his fortune in the tech industry but chose to remain humble and unassuming despite his wealth. 

Every morning, he puts on the same attire: a plain black t-shirt, khaki pants, and worn-out sneakers. To the average eye, he appears to be just another face in the crowd. He spends his days not in opulent boardrooms, but rather in quaint cafes, where he is always absorbed in either a novel or his laptop, ever curious and eager to learn. 

James prefers solitude and discretion over the fanfare associated with high society. He believes that true worth isn't measured by the price tag on your clothes but by the richness of your character and the value you bring to society. At the end of the day, James Harrison, in his simple clothes, is far more than a millionaire; he's a millionaire with a purpose.",B,2013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 013 0

He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.

C. The war, which had raged on for several brutal years, had finally reached its conclusion. The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship. The war was over, and the world had chosen peace.
D. John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.",B,"#1 New York Times bestselling author, and the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, Toni Morrison, has died at the age of 88.

Morrison was born in Lorain, Ohio, in 1931, and grew up in the steel town of Lorain, Ohio. She began writing at an early age, and her first novel, ""The Bluest Eye,"" was published in 1970. The novel was a critical and commercial success, and established Morrison as a major voice in American literature.

Throughout her career, Morrison wrote 11 novels, including ""Sula,"" ""Song of Solomon,"" and ""Beloved,"" which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988. She also wrote several non-fiction works, including ""Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination.""

Morrison was known for her powerful and poignant portrayals of the African American experience, and her work often explored themes of race, identity, and the search for self-discovery. She was also a professor at Princeton University and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

225,Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it.,"Our friend group had a long-standing tradition of watching newly released movies every Friday. However, last Friday was different. I was swamped with work, Jason fell sick, and Lisa had an unexpected family gathering, leaving Sam alone for the weekly movie outing.

Despite the unusual circumstances, Sam's enthusiasm for movies was undeterred. She went to watch the latest thriller, a movie we had all been waiting for. The moment she returned, our group chat was abuzz with messages, everyone impatiently waiting for a detailed review of the film.

""Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it,"" said Lisa in the group chat, echoing everyone's anticipation.

We all agreed, quickly setting up a video call so that Sam could relay the story in detail. As she began narrating the plot, her excitement filled the digital room. It was a unique experience, hearing the story directly from Sam, and while we missed being there, we were glad that our Friday movie tradition lived on.","A. The bell rang for the next class but there was no teacher in sight. The students, realizing they were momentarily unsupervised, started acting out. What began as innocent fun quickly escalated into chaos. The normally disciplined class turned into a playground. Papers were thrown across the room like snowballs, markers and pencils became dart missiles and textbooks were used as makeshift footballs. 

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede. The noise reached its crescendo, until suddenly, the door flung open. A shocked silence fell upon the room as the late-arriving teacher stepped in, taking in the spectacle. The students, knowing they were in trouble, quickly scrambled to fix the mess they had created in the class.
B. From the moment the idea was first introduced, I was completely against nationalization. I found it difficult to believe how anyone could view this process as anything but invasive and controlling. The concept of the government taking over privately-owned industries was deeply unsettling to me. It wasn't just a matter of economic principles; it was an assault on individual freedoms.

As a vocal critic, I resisted nationalization wholeheartedly. I wrote articles, gave speeches, and even attended heated political debates. I tried to warn others about the dangers of state ownership, how it discourages innovation, stifles competition, and potentially jeopardizes the rights of workers and consumers.

However, my unpopular stance made me an outsider. My acquaintances viewed my resistance as a lack of patriotism or a result of selfish capitalist views. In the process, I became quite unpopular, isolated from those who once respected me.

However, I chose to stand by my principles. I refused to bend to the popular opinion. I felt it was more important to defend what I believed to be true than to be popular. If anything, the experience hardened my resolve and confirmed to me the importance of holding firm to one's convictions, regardless of the cost.
C. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.

226,This shopkeeper always palms off old stock to the customers.,"In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

The town's elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, regularly visited his store for their weekly groceries. They were often the victims of his ploys, ending up with half-rotten tomatoes and stale bread more often than not. But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business. The residents of the small coastal town continued to buy from him - some out of convenience, others out of habit.","A. Being accepted into the prestigious Hawthorne Institute is not an easy task. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam, a test designed to measure not only the intelligence but the perseverance and determination of the applicants. Not everyone can pass it; every year, out of hundreds of candidates, only a handful of the brightest and most determined scholars make it through.

Take the case of Amelia Jenkins, a determined and passionate student who had her eyes set on the Institute since her early childhood. Day in and day out, she would immerse herself in her studies, foregoing social events and other recreational activities. She understood that casual leisure was a luxury she couldn't afford at the moment. 

Yet, even with such intense determination and unwavering focus, Amelia found herself struggling with some of the complex problems in the entrance exam. She realized that merely studying hard would not guarantee her success; she needed to study smart as well. Adopting new strategies and methods, she started approaching the problems from a different perspective. Eventually, with her relentless effort, she managed to clear the exam, proving that while the task was indeed challenging, it was not impossible. It merely required an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, and a smart approach to problem-solving.
B. Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.
C. It's hard to love with a broken heart. Mary knew this all too well as she looked at her own reflection in the mirror. The lines of sadness etched in her face, her eyes dull and lifeless. It was as though her very soul had been shattered into pieces. She had once been vibrant and full of life, but now she was just a husk of her former self.

Her heart, once whole and filled with love, had been broken by the man she loved more than anything in the world. Betrayal had taken its toll, transforming her from a carefree woman in love to a broken shell, mistrustful and afraid to love again. She turned away from the mirror, her heart aching at the sight of her broken self. 

Every day was a struggle to get out of bed, to face the world with a false smile while her heart was bleeding. It was hard to love with a broken heart, indeed, but Mary knew that she needed to find a way to heal, to love again, for her own sanity and happiness.
D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics, seeing it merely as a jumble of numbers and variables that are not relatable to everyday life. Often, they regard math as a complicated series of equations and formulas to memorize. However, this perspective does not do justice to the richness and depth of this discipline. To me, mathematics is the most meaningful subject.

From an early age, I've always been fascinated by the harmony and precision found in mathematical concepts. The pure logic and absolute certainty captured in mathematical proofs provide a sense of satisfaction and comfort that no other subject can offer. As I manipulate figures and calculate equations, I feel a connection with the universe's fundamental laws and principles.

Every formula and theorem in mathematics reveals something profound about our world. It expresses abstract ideas like infinity and simplicity with an elegant language of numbers and symbols. Despite its complexity, the beauty of mathematics lies in its simplicity, consistency, and its ability to describe the world with absolute precision.

The process of solving a mathematical problem is like an exciting journey of discovery. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving a complex equation is unparalleled. This is the beauty I find in mathematics, making it, for me, the most meaningful subject.",B,"```

227,She tried to hand over the hardest part of the assignment on me so she doesn't have to do it.,"I had always known Miranda to be a crafty girl, but it wasn't until we were paired up for a history project that I saw just how sneaky she could be. The project was to create a detailed timeline on the events of the Revolutionary War, clearly not an easy task. We agreed to share the work equally, to make the workload lighter for both of us. However, I soon noticed Miranda's work ethic didn't quite match mine.

One day, while we were brainstorming in the library, Miranda suggested we divide the tasks. To my surprise, she offered to take over the easy part, compiling the list of dates and events. She then suggested I take up the responsibility of researching each event in depth, crafting detailed descriptions, and designing the physical timeline; the hardest part of the assignment.

Miranda said it so sweetly, with a harmless smile and an innocent tilt of her head. But I immediately saw through her. She was trying to hand over the hardest part of the assignment to me so she doesn't have to do it. Realizing her cunning intentions, I decided to negotiate the division of tasks more fairly, refusing to let her escape her fair share of the work.","A. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.

But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business. The residents of the small coastal town continued to buy from him - some out of convenience, others out of habit.
C. I have always been one to admire bold, vibrant colours. Deep reds, cobalt blues and vibrant oranges that make a statement, that catch your eye even from afar. You, on the other hand, decided to get a soft muted beige car, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.

""I don’t really like the colour of your car,"" I remember saying to you one sunny afternoon, as we sat on the porch, sipping on homemade lemonade. I even pointed to your car, parked at the curb, as if you didn't know which one I was referring to.

You laughed, a soft chuckle that had me smirking, before setting down your glass on the table. ""I figured as much,"" you responded, a teasing glint in your eyes. ""But then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.""

I had to concede, knowing you had a point. After all, you were always drawn to the softer, subtler things in life, that found beauty in simplicity, and it was one of the many reasons I adored you. So although I may not have agreed with your choice of car colour, I could still appreciate why you chose it. It was, after all, very you.
D. We all begin our lives in the same humble manner, as innocent and inexperienced infants, new to the world and unaware of its complexities. From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.",B,", the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"

These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.","A. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.
B. Jimmy had spent the last few weeks fretting over his course selection for the next semester. He was a sophomore at the prestigious Canterbury University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. He had a deep interest in his field of study but deciding on what courses to take was proving to be a daunting task. The options were extensive and each course was as appealing as the other.

One afternoon, he decided to seek help and scheduled a meeting with Professor Marks. He was renowned in the University for his excellent teaching and deep knowledge of the field. Armed with a list of courses, Jimmy met with the professor. The professor's deep insight into each course, its prospects and challenges offered Jimmy a clear perspective about his choices.

By the end of the discussion, Jimmy felt less overwhelmed. He was reassured after consulting with the Professor Marks about what courses to take next semester, and he finally felt ready to take on the next step in his educational journey.
C. In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

D. John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence.

229,Victor from school is always trying to sell old coins to me saying they are rare and valuable.,"Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.","A. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.
B. Mary had been spending her evenings meticulously browsing through travel websites, picking out destinations she would love to visit. She dreamed of soaking up the sun on an isolated beach, or getting lost in an exotic market in some far-off land. She was just about to book a trip to the Maldives when reality sank in. A big work project was in its peak stage and she was one of the key members in her team.

Her heart sank as she started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done. Mary found herself caught between her job responsibilities and the need to give herself a break. On the one hand, the project held importance, but on the other hand, her yearning for vacation grew more intense by the day.

She hesitated for a moment, her hand hovering over the 'Book Now' button. But her professional integrity pulled her back, knowing her team would struggle without her. She sighed and closed the tab, making a mental note to reward herself with the trip once the project was successfully completed.

D. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.",C,16.12.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
230,The music producer selects a less liked song from his collection for his least favorite client.,"In the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, Dan Murphy, a renowned music producer, was hard at work in his state-of-the-art recording studio. Amid the collection of records, tracks, and albums strewn about his desk, one particular task was causing him more distress than any other. It involved his least favorite client, a pompous pop star named Jimmy Sparkle who had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way.

Dan sifted through his vast collection of yet-to-be-released songs, attempting to find one suitable for his demanding client. He chuckled cynically, deciding to choose a tune that wasn't well-received in initial listening sessions. It was a less liked song, one that was penned for an indie artist but somehow didn't make the cut. He remembered the honest lyrics and quirky melody that was met with mixed responses - not all songs can please everyone, he thought.

Feeling a twisted satisfaction, Dan selected the track for Jimmy, the epitome of mainstream pop, a stark contrast to the spirit of the song. He burned the track onto a CD, the words 'New Single - Jimmy Sparkle' etched into it, then packed it away to send to the insufferable pop star. Perhaps, he thought, this could be an awakening for Jimmy, an opportunity for him to make something meaningful instead of his usual cookie-cutter pop. Or perhaps, it would be a disastrous mismatch that would humble him, either way, Dan felt it was a win-win situation for himself.","A.

B. Ron had always been the free spirit in his family, having no major responsibilities or commitments to worry about. Unlike his older siblings, who were all burdened with jobs, education, and family commitments, Ron's lifestyle seemed to be worry-free. His family and friends saw him as an amusing diversion from their own responsibilities, and his lack of any real obligations became a sort of running joke. 

Amid the laughter and banter, Ron realized that he was relegated to the role of the family clown, making others laugh but never given the chance to prove himself otherwise. He felt that his capability to handle complex situations was overlooked, unappreciated even. Thus, he decided to prove his ability in a rather unconventional manner - pranks.

Ron began devising detailed and complex pranks that required a lot of planning and execution. He wanted these pranks to reflect his creativity and strategic thinking, a demonstration of his potential if given actual responsibilities. Each prank, meticulously planned, and well-executed, started to earn him notoriety amongst his friends and family.

Eventually, people began to notice the complexity and detail behind his pranks, starting to appreciate the potential Ron was aiming to showcase. Through his unconventional approach, Ron had managed to turn his lack of responsibilities into a platform to illustrate his capabilities in managing complex tasks.
C. Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words. The multinational company soon realized they had made the wrong choice, and that the flashy CEO's charm and charisma had blinded them to his real lack of substance.
D. On a typical weekday morning, Tom woke up and thought of a new challenge - he decided to drive to his office for the first time. Having only recently acquired his driving license, Tom was eager to flaunt his new skill. Looking out the window, he saw the bustle of the city roads, and naively thought, ""It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic."" 

As he got into his car, a sense of determination flooded him. He started his journey, but very soon was submerged into the chaotic labyrinth of urban traffic. Cars of all sizes were trying to outsmart each other, trying to find any room possible to pass through. The honking horns and the frequent brake lights turned his simple morning drive into a nerve-racking test. 

An hour passed in what seemed like an eternity, and Tom found himself only halfway to his destination. He then realized the truth of the common saying, ""Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos."" Wiping the sweat off his brow, Tom quietly admired those who braved these roads daily. He understood that driving wasn't just about controlling the steering wheel, but it also required adaptability and a lot of patience. He decided then and there that he needed more practice before he could join the ranks of those seasoned drivers.",A,D.
231,The chef picks out a dish from his list of simpler recipies for the less adventurous customer.,"Chef Marco, an experienced professional with a taste for adventure, scanned his kitchen bustling with activity. He was used to a clientele that was more daring in their culinary tastes, always willing to try something new and exciting. Today, however, he found himself serving a less adventurous customer, someone who had no particular desire to explore the exotic and unusual dishes that were Chef Marco's specialty. He had no wish to force his culinary philosophy on anyone who was not willing to accept it.

With a sigh, Chef Marco took a step back, consulting his list of simpler recipes reserved for such instances. His eyes quickly scanned over the list, finally settling on the perfect dish - a classic beef stew with roasted vegetables, a comforting dish that was sure to satisfy. His hands started to move with an assured fluidity, expertly cutting the beef and vegetables into equal sizes, then browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables. 

He simmered everything in a robust broth, letting the aroma fill his kitchen. He knew this dish was a world away from his typical experimental recipes, but he also knew that sometimes, simplicity has its own charm. As he served the customer, he did so with the same level of pride, knowing that even with less adventurous dishes, his skills as a chef could still shine.","A. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.

C. Frank had been all around the world, from bustling cities to desolate deserts, in pursuit of his career. A translator by profession, his work took him far and wide, away from the comfort of his small town in New Hampshire. Being a diligent and committed man, Frank invested years in adapting to diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. But, he always yearned for the familiarity and comfort of his hometown. 

One winter, after a decade overseas, Frank decided to return home. He was ecstatic as he packed his bags, each piece of clothing he folded bringing him one step closer to the solace he missed. The journey felt nostalgic as he drove through the sleepy lanes leading to his quaint wooden house. 

Finally, Frank found himself in his old room, staring at the childhood bed that bore witness to his dreams of adventure. The sight of the bed, washed in the soft, warm glow of his old table lamp, invited him with an embrace of familiarity. That night, he crawled under his worn-out quilt, and for the first time in years, Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed, surrounded by the soothing aura of his home country.

Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.","A. As the sun began to fade behind the mountains, the chill in the air became more profound. ""Let's make-do with the cold and build a fire instead of waiting for the weather to warm up,"" Sarah suggested, rubbing her hands together for warmth. Her three friends agreed, gathering around the idea like moths drawn to a flame.

Jack and Emily quickly started collecting dry twigs and leaves, their breath visible in the freezing air. Meanwhile, Sarah and Luke began to dig a pit in the snow where they could safely contain the fire. The cooperation between the four friends was seamless, their collective desire for warmth surpassing the fatigue of their mountain hike.

By the time the moon had crept up the sky, the fire was blazing, its warmth bathing the four friends. They sat around it, passing around a thermos of hot cocoa, and shared tales of past adventures. As the night wore on, they found comfort in the fire, in their friendship, and in making do with what nature provided. Instead of yearning for warmer weather, they embraced the cold, for it was a part of their memorable journey.
B. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention. This was a tradition established long ago during our university days. Tom was the president of the student council, responsible for organizing most of the major events on campus. He had a unique method for ensuring each event's success, isolating himself from the rest of us to focus completely.

Before every major event, Tom would retreat into solitude for days at a time. He would sit in his room, surrounded by piles of papers, charts, and notes, tirelessly working to iron out the minutest details of the event. Every element of the event, from the decor to the itinerary, was meticulously planned by him.

We often joked about Tom's obsessive planning habits. Yet, no one could deny the spectacular results he achieved. His dedication and focus always ensured an extraordinary event, much to the delight of everyone involved. As unusual as his methods were, Tom’s ability to deliver a successful event was unparalleled.
C. When I first started the training program, I was brimming with confidence. I was certain that I would breeze through it in the estimated one year. Unfortunately, life had other plans, and I faced unexpected challenges that made it impossible for me to complete it within the suggested timeframe. My mother's sudden illness required me to return home and take over the family business.

I remember thinking that I had failed, that I wouldn't get the chance to complete my training. Yet, I didn't let that deter me completely. I continued the program while juggling responsibilities at home. It took me twice as long as most of my peers, extending my training into three years instead of the projected one. There were times I wanted to give up, but I held on, fueled by sheer determination. The journey took longer than expected, but at least I have the credential now, proving that endurance and resilience can overcome the toughest of circumstances.
D. Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.",B,s 20196. 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0

Before every major event, Tom would retreat into solitude for days at a time. He would sit in his room, surrounded by piles of papers, charts, and notes, tirelessly working to iron out the minutest details of the event. Every element of the event, from the decor to the itinerary, was meticulously planned by him.

We often joked about Tom's obsessive planning habits. Yet, no one could deny the spectacular results he achieved. His dedication and focus always ensured an extraordinary event, much to the delight of everyone involved. As unusual as his methods were, Tom’s ability to deliver a successful event was unparalleled.","A. Dr. Stevenson, a renowned neurosurgeon, had an important surgery scheduled the next day, a complex brain procedure that required his full concentration and skill. Aware of the gravity of the operation, he decided to dedicate the entire day before to preparing both mentally and physically. In order to do this, he needed an environment free from any distractions, no matter how insignificant they might seem.

He called a brief meeting with his staff, comprised of dedicated nurses, young eager interns, and experienced assistants. The doctor explained the nature of the surgery, a meticulous procedure that could significantly change his patient's life. He expressed his need for quiet and uninterrupted focus for his preparation.

""Tomorrow's operation is a challenging one,"" Dr. Stevenson told his team, his voice steady and commanding respect. ""I would like to ask you not to interrupt me with any minor tasks today, unless it is a critical issue."" 

The staff listened intently and understood the seriousness of his request. They promised to uphold their roles efficiently so the doctor could fully concentrate on the impending procedure. Dr. Stevenson nodded, pleased with his team's commitment, and retired to his office to start his comprehensive preparation for the critical surgery.
B. After weeks of hunting for a place to stay, I finally found a modest apartment. The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.
C. Steve attended yet another networking event, hoping to gain a deeper insight into the startup scene in Silicon Valley. Amidst a sea of burgeoning companies, one in particular managed to catch his attention - a green tech startup aiming to revolutionize renewable energy. Over the last few weeks, he had been exposed to the company through aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns. The buzzwords and slogans, while catchy, felt hollow. They gave him a surface-level understanding but lacked depth.

Today, however, he got a chance to hear their business pitch in person. The startup's CEO passionately presented the business model, clearly explaining how they intended to generate renewable energy more efficiently and affordably. He talked about potential market penetration strategies, discussed revenue models, and answered challenging questions from the audience with ease.

To Steve, hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising. Through the pitch, he gained a comprehensive understanding of the startup, and it instilled confidence in him to consider investing.
D. John had always been the type to ignore minor problems, allowing them to fester until they became significant issues. One morning, he noticed his car making an odd, grumbling noise. It was a small thing, but a clear sign of something potentially amiss under the hood. ""Don’t ignore the sudden malfunctioning of your car, just go to the garage,"" his wife, Martha, had admonished him countless times. 

But John, ever the procrastinator, chose to put it off. He was busy with work, and besides, the car seemed to be running fine. His mother's old adage echoed in his ears, ""A stitch in time saves nine,"" but he brushed it off, thinking it could wait.

Three days later, the grumbling noise became a horrendous clanging and the engine gave out halfway to work. John ended up stranded in the middle of a busy highway during peak rush hour. He then had to arrange for a tow, miss an important meeting, and pay a heavy repair bill, all of which could have been avoided if he’d listened to his wife and mother. So, he learned the hard way, ignoring the problem only made it worse.",A,"s and the other day.

234,"Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, so he went to the cabin where no one could disturb him.","Ramos was a well-established author known for his profound and thought-provoking novels. Over the past months, he had been painstakingly piecing together his latest literary masterpiece. Yet, every time he tried to find the quiet focus he needed to finish his project, a string of disturbances impeded his progress.

He was unable to concentrate with the hustle and bustle of city life that invaded his quiet work space. Between the phone ringing off the hook and constant knocks at his door, peace was a luxury he couldn't afford. His patience waning, Ramos decided to finish writing the novel over the weekend, far away from these distractions. 

He knew of an old rustic cabin located in the heart of a peaceful forest. The cabin was devoid of any signs of modern life - no phone, no internet, no television. It was his sanctuary, a place where he could shut out the world and dive deep into his imagination. So, he packed his essentials, manuscripts in tow, and headed to the cabin where no one could disturb him.","A. My heart skips a beat every time I imagine myself skydiving. The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. My mother, a renowned psychiatrist, had an important conference to prepare for. The conference was a significant event in her career, an opportunity to showcase her research on ""Effective Mental Health Interventions for Youth."" As much as she loved us, her kids, her dedication to her work and to mental health awareness was resolute. In the coming weeks, her focus was more intense than I had ever seen before.

Ever since our father passed away, my brother and I had unwittingly become a bit too needy. We missed him terribly, and our need for attention often manifested as day to day rants and petty fights. But for the moment, with her conference looming, our mother could not indulge us.

""You boys will have to sort your quarrels out yourselves,"" she said with an apologetic smile, her gaze already back on the piles of research papers.

As she immersed herself in her work, my brother and I, at loose ends, were forced to deal with our feelings on our own. In the process, we discovered we had more in common than we thought, including a shared admiration for our mother’s dedication. Perhaps her refusal to entertain our day to day rants and fights wasn’t such a bad thing after all.
C. John had always been a hard worker. He'd arrive at the office before everyone else and would be the last to leave, ensuring that all his assignments were done promptly and correctly. His dedication was unshakeable, and it didn't go unnoticed. 

Recently, management had held a meeting, discussing the various improvements in company processes. John's name was mentioned frequently, many complimenting his diligence and commitment to his job. The executives were impressed by his accomplishments and his ability to inspire his colleagues. The decision was then made, a vote unanimous in favor of acknowledging John's efforts.

When the announcement came, John was taken aback. His superiors congratulated him, thanking him for his tireless work and positive influence on the team. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion, a well-deserved reward for his relentless determination and commitment to the company.
D. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.",B,"s and the 20s and the 3s and the 4s and the 5s and the 6s.

Nina was not in the mood for distractions today, as she slipped on her headphones at her desk. Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.
B. Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal. 

Laura is a dedicated artist, consumed by her work and often forgetting to take a break. Today was no different. She had started her marathon early in the morning. The sun had barely risen when she set up her easel and palette. Now, as the last rays of the setting sun seeped through the studio window, she lay exhausted on the floor.

Despite my insistence, she refused to get up for several minutes. The artistic satisfaction coursing through her veins seemed to outweigh the physical fatigue. I admired her dedication, as Laura proved yet again, that for her, art wasn't just a hobby but a way of life.
C. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages. It was a sight that reminded Rory of the powerful bond of family, no matter how far apart they might be physically.
D. Dr. Smith, the chemistry professor at Northwood University, sat quietly in his office preparing to deliver some unfortunate news. He had been grading papers all morning when he'd noticed a peculiar mistake in his register. One of his top students, Anna, had been marked as having scored an A in Chemistry. Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.",A,s and the 190s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the
236,Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.,"Philip was a dedicated software engineer, a genius in his own right, engrossed in a challenging project. It was a complicated task that required immense concentration and his complete attention. Thus, Philip decided he needed to dedicate an entire day solely to this project, eliminating all potential distractions.

Before plunging into his work, he looked around at his desk cluttered with a multitude of devices, each pinging with notifications and reminders. Aware of their tempting, disruptive potential, he resolved to turn every single one of them off, a decision he rarely made. He powered down his smartphone, tablet, and even his smartwatch, silencing all of his digital diversions. A feeling of silence enveloped him, which was alien yet oddly comforting.

With the distractions abated, Philip found himself entirely in the zone, solving complex coding problems he had previously found insurmountable. The day stretched into evening, and Philip remained engrossed in his work, only pausing for the briefest of breaks. By the time the moon was high in the sky, Philip finally sat back, satisfied. His day of intense focus had paid off, he had completed his project, proving to himself the power of undisturbed concentration.","A. Peter had always been the practical one in their relationship, a trait that his wife, Amanda, both admired and occasionally got frustrated with. One evening, they sat together in their cozy living room, meticulously planning their upcoming vacation. Amanda was filled with excitement, bubbling with ideas about exploring the tropical islands of Hawaii, each suggestion more vibrant and adventurous than the last. 

Peter watched his wife with a soft smile, her excitement was infectious and normally he'd be just as enthusiastic. But this time, his face was clouded with worry, the responsibility of a problem he was trying to figure out how to communicate. Taking a deep breath, he finally decided to bring up the issue. 

He told his wife that he didn’t want to rain on her parade, but they had to shift their vacation dates. A work project had suddenly come up, clashing with their holiday. Amanda's excitement immediately faltered, but she could see the stress in Peter's eyes and knew there was no other choice. They would adjust the dates, understanding that while they both loved to vacation, the reality of life sometimes called for unplanned changes and flexibility.
B. Kate had always been a hardworking and dedicated employee, until one day, she was unjustly fired from her job. The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively. She started looking for a new job, determined to move on from the past and prove her worth elsewhere.
C. My brother and I share a love for music, but our tastes can be worlds apart. His music tastes lean more towards pop and R&B, while I am more of a hard rock and alternative enthusiast. There is one particular singer that has captured my brother's admiration, someone whose vocals and techniques seem to utterly enchant him. Although this artist isn't my favorite singer, my brother absolutely adores his vocals and techniques.

He would spend countless hours singing along to his songs and watching his concerts on YouTube. The singer's delicate control over his voice, how he subtly transitioned from soft and mellow to high and powerful notes, seemed to mesmerize my brother. He'd even taken to practicing the same techniques, humming the singer's songs in the shower or when he was alone in his room.

Yet for me, his music was a little too slow and didn't carry the energy and angst I preferred. I tried to appreciate it, for the sake of my brother, but it didn't quite resonate with me. But even though this singer wasn't my favorite, I respected his talent and more importantly, the joy he brought to my brother.

His cool, calm, collected exterior masked the thrill rushing through his veins. After hours of mediocre hands, this was the one he'd been waiting for - a straight flush in spades. The corners of his lips tilted upwards in a barely visible smile. 

Across the table, his opponents, a tough group of poker regulars, continued their tactical bluffing, unaware of Derek's excitement. He matched their bets without hesitation, his confident eyes never wavering. Round after round, he kept calling, his pile of chips dwindling steadily. 

Finally, the last round arrived and with a deep breath, Derek pushed his remaining chips into the center. He had staked all his money, leaving his fate at the mercy of the cards. The room held its breath, waiting for the reveal, intrigued to see whether Derek's confidence was well-founded or misplaced.
B. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
C. As an avid movie lover, I've always appreciated the beauty of cinema more than literature. A couple of weeks ago, my friend, a passionate reader, recommended an epic fantasy series to me. She exclaimed, ""You just have to read these books. The story is enchanting!"" However, the thought of reading five massive volumes was daunting. Each book, she said, was a thousand pages of intricate world-building, nuanced character development, and twisting plotlines. The time commitment alone was overwhelming. 

With some research, I discovered that a film adaptation had been made of the entire series. It intrigued me more than the prospects of wading through stacks of books. So, I decided to spare myself the cumbersome task of reading the novels and simply watch the adaptation. ""I can just watch the adaptation instead of reading the 5 massive books the adaptation was based on,"" I informed her, much to her horror and my relief.
D. Whenever Tom had an important event to plan for, he would not meet with any of us and work on that plan with full attention. This was a tradition established long ago during our university days.

238,"Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.","Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick. To sell his story, he even shared details of a make-believe doctor's visit and incessantly discussed his fictional symptoms. This charade continued for an entire week while his boss unknowingly covered his workload. 

Upon his return, Andy confidently strolled into the office, expecting his little ruse to have gone undetected. However, his boss, Mrs. Thompson, had been contacted by a mutual friend who had spotted Andy lounging on a beach during his supposed sick leave. In a short, tense meeting, Mrs. Thompson voiced her disappointment and warned Andy about his position in the company, reminding him that trustworthiness was critical.

Andy, realizing the severity of his actions, found himself teetering on very thin ice. His boss's rebuke had made clear that another transgression could cost him his job. Determined to make amends, Andy began formulating a plan to regain Mrs. Thompson's trust and save his reputation at work.","A. As an avid hiker, I have trekked through these woods countless times. I've crunched over the fallen leaves, clambered over moss-covered stones, and seen the sunlight fracture through the canopy above. Although I'm pretty familiar with this part of the woods and don't need a map, I still brought one with me in case I got lost during the hike. Old habits die hard and I was always a firm believer in being prepared for anything.

As I walked along the well-trodden path, I noted the familiar landmarks, an ancient gnarled tree, a babbling brook, and a large, flat-topped rock that served as an excellent resting place. But there's always an element of change in nature. A heavy storm could easily alter the landscape, causing fallen trees or creating new streams.

Hence, I always carried a map to navigate, should nature pull a surprise. And it has proven to be a lifesaver a few times when I've underestimated the wild's ability to transform. Regardless of how well I knew these woods, the map was my safety net; a comfort in the midst of the unpredictable wilderness. Even with my familiarity with these parts, I knew it wasn't wise to trek through the woods overconfidently, especially when navigating alone.
B. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey. Our minds are constantly preoccupied with the finish line, so much that we fail to savor the sights, sounds, and experiences along the way. Jake was no exception to this common human habit. He was a hardworking businessman who hardly ever enjoyed the pleasures life offered.

One day, on a train ride to an important meeting, Jake looked out of the window instead of his paperwork. For the first time, he noticed the various landscapes that his train crossed. He saw the lush fields streaked with golden sunlight, the rustic charm of the countryside, and children playing by the railway tracks, their laughter echoing as the train rushed past.

For a moment, he forgot about his destination, his meeting, and let himself be absorbed in the delightful scenes that unfolded. The train ride, which he always considered a monotonous part of his journey, seemed different, more meaningful. He realized then, that the journey to the destination could be as exciting and rewarding as the destination itself. This revelation changed Jake's perspective of life and made him appreciate his journeys more, irrespective of the destinations they led him to.
C. Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.
D. Philip was notorious for his clever excuses and sly tricks to dodge chores. His parents, especially his mother, were growing weary of this routine. The time had come when Philip had to understand the importance of work, no matter how trivial it seemed. One day, Philip adopted his tried and tested method of avoiding chores again. He started pretending to be immensely busy with his schoolwork. He was hoping this tactic would continue to serve him as it always had.

But his mother, observing him closely, started to sense that something was not right. After a little investigation, she found out he had no pending work from school. Seeing his lack of sincerity, his mother decided to teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget. She commanded Philip to take over the chores not just for that day, but for the entire week, forcing him to step into the reality of responsibility.",D,s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the 2013s and the
239,The manager saw that Silvy was passing on her clients for hair appointments to other professionals but was showing up for tips; she decided to fire her the next time.,"In the bustling city of New York, nestled among high rise buildings, there was a small upscale hair salon run by a strict manager named Theresa. She had a keen eye for detail and a firm belief in fairness and a strong work ethic. One of her hairstylists, Silvy, was a talented professional with a knack for creating the most fashionable haircuts. However, Theresa noticed a worrying trend in Silvy’s behavior.

She observed that Silvy, despite having a large client base due to her outstanding skills, was passing on her clients to other professionals in the salon. Yet, at the end of each session, Silvy would show up with a friendly smile to the customers, seeking tips for the appointments she hadn’t personally serviced. Theresa found this act not only unethical, but it also threatened to disrupt the harmony within the team.

Given Silvy’s popularity with the clients, Theresa initially hesitated, thinking about the potential revenue loss. But she valued her principles more than the temporary profits, and she decided that she wouldn’t tolerate such a practice. Therefore, she resolved to fire Silvy the next time she witnessed such behavior, thereby reinforcing her commitment to fair practice and integrity in her business.","A. At the starting line of the annual city marathon, I can see the intense determination in the eyes of my opponents. They stretch and jog in place, eager to claim the victory. What they don't understand, however, is that I possess a unique advantage. My greatest asset, largely hidden from their view, is my exceptional stamina. 

I've trained for years to build and maintain it, running countless miles in the dead of night when the world was fast asleep. I pushed my body beyond its limits, my legs aching and lungs gasping for breath. The strenuous workouts and tedious diet plans were all part of my secret strategy, ensuring a reserve of energy that won't easily dissipate. This strength allows me to keep going when others are gasping for breath, to maintain a steady pace when others begin to falter. 

I look at my opponents again, their faces filled with anticipation and nervous excitement. Little do they know that they stand no chance at all, for they are unaware of my greatest asset.
B. Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick. To sell his story, he even shared details of a make-believe doctor's visit and incessantly discussed his fictional symptoms. This charade continued for an entire week while his boss unknowingly covered his workload. 

Upon his return, Andy confidently strolled into the office, expecting his little ruse to have gone undetected. However, his boss, Mrs. Thompson, had been contacted by a mutual friend who had spotted Andy lounging on a beach during his supposed sick leave. In a short, tense meeting, Mrs. Thompson voiced her disappointment and warned Andy about his position in the company, reminding him that trustworthiness was critical.

Andy, realizing the severity of his actions, found himself teetering on very thin ice. His boss's rebuke had made clear that another transgression could cost him his job. Determined to make amends, Andy began formulating a plan to regain Mrs. Thompson's trust and save his reputation at work.
C. Sally had always been aware of her circumstances with Scott. In fact, she had thought through it again and again, turning it over in her mind like a coin inspecting all of its facets. She knew perfectly well that their situation was a complicated one; rife with obstacles that most would find insurmountable. Scott was married, he had children, he was also her boss.

Despite these reasons, there was an inexplicable connection that drew her towards him. Their mutual feelings for each other were undeniable, and while they made their relationship more complicated, they also made it more valuable. She saw the way he looked at her, the subtle signs of love and affection that were there for anyone observant enough to notice. 

Choosing to be with him wasn't an easy decision; it was a conscious choice she made, knowing full well the potential consequences. Sally wasn't clueless nor naive about what she was getting into. She simply decided that, for her, love was worth risking the circumstances.
D. Juli had always been fond of a particular towering oak tree in their backyard. It had been her favorite spot to read, and she had spent countless hours nestled in its sturdy branches. Then one day, a violent storm swept through their town, uprooting the mighty tree Juli loved so much. When Juli saw the tree in its fallen state, her heart ached with a sorrow that she could not put into words.

Understanding her sorrow, her father, who was a gifted artist, decided to immortalize the tree in a way only he could. He spent days working tirelessly, capturing every detail from the gnarled roots to the endless branches that had once reached towards the heavens. When he was done, he presented the painting to Juli with an apologetic smile.

He told her, ""There's nothing else we could do, Juli,"" his words full of empathy for his daughter's loss. The painting was a spectacular rendition of her favorite tree, standing tall and mighty just like how she remembered it. Juli found solace in her father's gift and realized that even though the tree had physically vanished from their backyard, it would forever remain alive in her heart and her father's masterpiece.",B,
240,"Soon after, Garry realized that Hannah was avoiding making the presentation by pretending to be occupied by personal issues, he planned to approach her about it if she repeated it again.","Garry had always admired Hannah's skills as an analyst, but he couldn't ignore the recent change in her behavior. She had always been the one to volunteer for presentations and company seminars, her confidence and eloquence leaving everyone impressed. But the past few weeks had been different. Her regular enthusiasm seemed to be drained, her willing participation turning into subtle avoidance.

One day, Garry overheard Hannah speaking on the phone in hushed tones, expressing her anxiety about an upcoming presentation to a friend. From that moment, he realized her avoidance wasn't just mere coincidence. It seemed as if Hannah was avoiding making the presentation by pretending to be occupied by personal issues.

Garry understood that everyone had their highs and lows, but he did not want Hannah to use this as a scapegoat to escape her responsibilities. He decided that if she continued with this behavior, he would have to have a word with her. He planned to approach her about it, hoping that some form of a solution could be worked out, if indeed, she was going through a tough time.","A. Amy was well-aware of the ticking clock, yet she was still miles away from completing her assigned homework. As the time continued to slip from her hands, she started to feel a surge of panic. Unable to finish the task on time, she pondered over her possible options. Among her choices was an old cliché: the classic ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. She knew it was a bold lie, her pet was an ageing Labrador, Bailey, who barely had the energy to play fetch, let alone eat her paperwork.

Despite her awareness of how false it sounded, Amy decided to pitch this excuse to her professor. She stood in front of him, putting on an expression of sorrow and disappointment. ""Professor,"" she started, ""my dog ate my homework."" 

However, her professor, a seasoned educator with years of experience, was not convinced. He looked at her through his spectacles and decided to penalize her for not only failing to submit the work on time, but also for attempting to deceive him. Amy learned her lesson that day: excuses, especially the ludicrous ones, seldom save the day.
B. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.
C. When some people see my Instagram feed, the beautiful snapshots of foreign landscapes and exotic food, they always say, ""It looks like fun."" And yes, there are moments that are incredibly exciting and fulfilling. But there's an untold reality to this adventurous facade that often gets overlooked. In reality, it is a struggle to move to a different country. 

It’s not just about adjusting to the new scenery or getting lost in translation. It's the deep-rooted homesickness that never seems to go away. It's missing your family's comfort, your friends' laughter, and the familiarity of your home. It’s the feeling of alienation while trying to fit in a culture so different from your own. 

So while you may look at my life and see an unending vacation, remember to count your blessings. The stability, comfort, and sense of belonging that comes with being home is a privilege not everyone enjoys. Cherishing that is more important than any far-flung adventure.
D. The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage.

She was the talk of the town, spinning outrageous stories about everyone, giving them enough reasons to loathe her presence. She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.

C. Philip was a dedicated software engineer, a genius in his own right, engrossed in a challenging project. It was a complicated task that required immense concentration and his complete attention. Thus, Philip decided he needed to dedicate an entire day solely to this project, eliminating all potential distractions.

Before plunging into his work, he looked around at his desk cluttered with a multitude of devices, each pinging with notifications and reminders. Aware of their tempting, disruptive potential, he resolved to turn every single one of them off, a decision he rarely made. He powered down his smartphone, tablet, and even his smartwatch, silencing all of his digital diversions. A feeling of silence enveloped him, which was alien yet oddly comforting.

With the distractions abated, Philip found himself entirely in the zone, solving complex coding problems he had previously found insurmountable. The day stretched into evening, and Philip remained engrossed in his work, only pausing for the briefest of breaks. By the time the moon was high in the sky, Philip finally sat back, satisfied. His day of intense focus had paid off, he had completed his project, proving to himself the power of undisturbed concentration.
D. Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer.

242,"The group had lied about one of them being out of town to avoid the meeting, but the professor discerned the truth and decided to deduct marks on the project.","At the prestigious Bellington University, a group of four science students were assigned a complex project that was to be presented in front of the entire class. Two weeks before the presentation, one member of the team, Jason, received news that his grandmother was critically ill. Despite his personal issues, Jason continued to contribute to the project to the best of his abilities. To ease Jason's stress, the group decided to concoct a small lie, stating that Jason was out of town visiting ailing relatives. They hoped this would exempt them from the presentation, allowing them to simply turn in the paper instead.

On the day of the meeting, one of the group members casually informed their professor, Dr. Sanders, about Jason's unexpected absence. However, Dr. Sanders, with his years of experience and knack for reading his students, discerned the fib. Coincidentally, he had seen Jason at the library earlier that day, working on the project. With the truth in sight, Dr. Sanders decided not to confront the group about their deception. Instead, he made the choice to deduct marks on their project, teaching them a valuable lesson about honesty and integrity in academia.","A.

B. Amelia Davis was a hard-hitting political figure known throughout the Golden State. A vibrant and charismatic woman, she had a knack for captivating anyone with her words and was always at the forefront of the political scene. In short, she was a renowned representative of California. But as she walked into the bustling coffee shop one rainy Tuesday morning, she noticed that no one gave her a second glance.

Her friend, John, a visiting politician from Arizona, was bewildered by this. He had expected some form of recognition, a nod of acknowledgment at the very least. He turned to the barista and exclaimed in disbelief, ""She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?""

The barista, a teenager with pink hair and numerous piercings, simply shrugged. ""Sorry, man, I just moved here from Ohio,"" she said, already turning to take the next customer's order. John was dumbfounded; Amelia merely chuckled at the welcome anonymity.
C. My sister, Emily, has a deeply ingrained fear of the dark that traces back to our childhood. As children, we would share ghost stories late at night, and Emily would always end up shaken, her imagination running wild. She was so petrified that she always left the hallway light on before going to sleep, casting a faint glow into her room. It was her way of dealing with the fear of what lurked in the darkness. 

But as we grew older, Emily decided that she could no longer allow her fear to dictate her life. She often spoke of her desire to one day sleep in a completely dark room, without the safety of the light from the hallway. It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.
D. Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between hills, a young boy named Max lived with his parents. He was a clever lad, always curious about the world around him. One day, his best friend, Danny, came to him with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. He suggested they steal apples from Mr. Johnson's orchard, as many other kids had done it before.

Max felt a rush of excitement at the idea, but at the same time, he knew it was wrong. He thought back to the lessons his parents had always taught him about right and wrong. He remembered them telling him, ""It is not acceptable to do a bad thing just because someone else has done it."" 

With his parents' words echoing in his mind, Max looked at Danny and shook his head. He explained to Danny that stealing was wrong, no matter how many others were doing it.

Dressed in crisp, expensive suits, they filled the room with an air of unspoken competition. Upon arrival, they had collected their name badges, exchanged courteous nods and pleasantries, and found their seats. 

As the seminar progressed, they listened intently to the speakers, taking meticulous notes and absorbing every new piece of information. The seminar was filled with informative sessions about business law, the evolving business environment, and how lawyers could adapt to these changes.

During the breaks, they began to form little clusters, engaging in heated discussions about the subjects at hand. The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves, dissecting the new strategies and theories presented. Opinions were shared, a healthy debate ensued, and insights were gained. 

The interactions at the seminar led to new connections and strengthened old ones. By the time the business seminar concluded, it was evident that the attending lawyers had not just learnt from the speakers, but also from each other.
B. Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.

244,"He told his wife that he doesn’t want to rain on her parade, but they had to shift their vacation dates.","Peter had always been the practical one in their relationship, a trait that his wife, Amanda, both admired and occasionally got frustrated with. One evening, they sat together in their cozy living room, meticulously planning their upcoming vacation. Amanda was filled with excitement, bubbling with ideas about exploring the tropical islands of Hawaii, each suggestion more vibrant and adventurous than the last. 

Peter watched his wife with a soft smile, her excitement was infectious and normally he'd be just as enthusiastic. But this time, his face was clouded with worry, the responsibility of a problem he was trying to figure out how to communicate. Taking a deep breath, he finally decided to bring up the issue. 

He told his wife that he didn’t want to rain on her parade, but they had to shift their vacation dates. A work project had suddenly come up, clashing with their holiday. Amanda's excitement immediately faltered, but she could see the stress in Peter's eyes and knew there was no other choice. They would adjust the dates, understanding that while they both loved to vacation, the reality of life sometimes called for unplanned changes and flexibility.","A. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages. It was a sight that reminded Rory of the powerful bond of family, no matter how far apart they might be physically.
B. Alena was a quiet and introverted girl in her senior year of high school. She was consistently seen in the library or the laboratory, completely immersed in her books. She was never a part of the overly flamboyant crowd, the ones who enjoyed boasting about their intelligence, their latest scores, and achievements. In contrast to them, Alena had a calm, poised demeanor.

People often underestimated her due to her unassuming personality. Even her teachers were unaware of the prodigy that hid beneath her humble exterior. Her friends, however, knew about her dedication, about the late-night study sessions and countless revisions she put into her preparation for the board exams.

The result day arrived, and everyone held their breath in anticipation. The school's top rank was taken by the usual, boastful scholar. However, when Alena's name was announced for the second position, the hall echoed with surprise and admiration. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams.

C. I could sense the excitement in your eyes when you suggested the idea of spending the entire day together. We had been planning this day out for a while and I was really looking forward to it. Just as I was about to express my enthusiasm, my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen; it was my sister calling. She hardly ever rings me during the day unless it's something urgent.

She told me that she had an emergency at work and needed me to babysit her son, my nephew, for the day. I sighed, knowing that our long-awaited day out was going to be postponed once again. I turned to you, taking a deep breath before speaking. ""I do not want to spoil your mood but I have to babysit my nephew today,"" I said with a tone of regret. I could see the disappointment flash across your face, but you quickly masked it with an understanding smile.
D. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.",C,s and the 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2021 2021 2020 2021 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 2 there 20 21 there 21 there 21 there
245,I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.,"Dr. Smith, the chemistry professor at Northwood University, sat quietly in his office preparing to deliver some unfortunate news. He had been grading papers all morning when he'd noticed a peculiar mistake in his register. One of his top students, Anna, had been marked as having scored an A in Chemistry. Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.","A. As the team leader for an advertising agency, I had always valued the contribution of each member. Hence, when one of my subordinates, Mike, came to me requesting early vacation, I was initially tempted to agree. Mike had always been hardworking and it seemed fair to let him have his break. However, there was one issue. Mike had not yet presented his work on our current project for review.

I looked at him, sighed deeply, and said, ""I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation."" His face fell as he realized the impending delay in his plans. 

I explained to him that we needed his report to move forward with the project and that his break could be detrimental to our progress. Mike understood, nodded, and agreed to work on his presentation immediately. While I wished I could have granted his request immediately, I knew the hard truth of our profession: our work had to come first before personal pursuits.
B. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.
C. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.
D. Jeremy had known Rick for years, ever since they were young boys playing football on the neighborhood streets. Their friendship had always been rocky, filled with competitive banter and rivalry. Over time, Jeremy realized Rick's friendship wasn't as genuine as it seemed. Rick was more inclined towards the glitz of wealth and constantly pursued money. He was the kind of person who'd turn his back on his friends if it meant getting a bigger piece of the pie. 

Despite this, Jeremy didn't cut ties with Rick. He was aware that Rick's intentions were shallow and centered around his own self-interest. Nonetheless, Jeremy decided to continue his friendship with Rick, albeit with more caution and less trust. He figured he could manage to get along with him for the time being, at least until the dynamics of their relationship changed. It was a harsh reality to accept but Jeremy found comfort in the knowledge that he understood Rick's motives and could navigate their relationship accordingly.",A,and the 20.20 2018. 2010 18 0 1. 0. 1. 1. 2. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

""I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you're not allowed in this party anymore. You're on the blocklist!""

Just a week ago, Matt had caused a scene by picking a fight with another club patron. Alcohol fuelled his arrogance and disregard for the night's merriment, which in turn led to his banishment. It wasn't the first time Matt had behaved in such a manner, but it was the last straw for the club's management.

Matt tried to argue, claiming he had changed, but the bouncer merely shook his head. A lesson had to be learned, and this party, the grandest of the year, was off-limits for him. Disappointed and crestfallen, Matt turned around and walked away, the loud beats of the party echoing behind him.","A.

B. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.
C. John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence. It is a painful reality that he is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.
D. Philip was notorious for his clever excuses and sly tricks to dodge chores. His parents, especially his mother, were growing weary of this routine. The time had come when Philip had to understand the importance of work, no matter how trivial it seemed. One day, Philip adopted his tried and tested method of avoiding chores again. He started pretending to be immensely busy with his schoolwork. He was hoping this tactic would continue to serve him as it always had.

But his mother, observing him closely, started to sense that something was not right. After a little investigation, she found out he had no pending work from school. Seeing his lack of sincerity, his mother decided to teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget. She commanded Philip to take over the chores not just for that day, but for the entire week, forcing him to step into the reality of responsibility.",A,

Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.

C. Liam, a boy with a burning desire for knowledge, couldn't resist the urge to attend the prestigious St. Veron High School. However, he lived outside the school's strict catchment area. Determined to bypass this roadblock, Liam lied about his address to get into the school; Lary, his next-door neighbor and best friend, did not. He lived just inside the catchment, making him eligible to attend St. Veron without any extra measures.

Despite the excitement of his acceptance, Liam soon found himself overwhelmed. He had a difficult time trying to hide the deception he had weaved. He lived in constant fear of being found out, struggling to keep his story straight, always on edge whenever school district officials were mentioned. 

In contrast, Lary attended the same school but without the added stress of a lie hovering over him. Since he was rightfully a part of the institution, he had no need to worry about anything else. His focus was entirely on his academic progression and making the most out of the opportunities that St. Veron High School provided. As a result of his peace of mind and stress-free situation, Lary had a terrific time, excelling both in his studies and social activities.
D. Alena was a quiet and introverted girl in her senior year of high school. She was consistently seen in the library or the laboratory, completely immersed in her books. She was never a part of the overly flamboyant crowd, the ones who enjoyed boasting about their intelligence, their latest scores, and achievements.

248,The company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees.,"Peachwood Technologies, a mid-sized tech firm, had always boasted about its stable financial standing. However, this year had been turbulent and the company had taken a considerable financial hit due to unforeseen market conditions. As a result, the board was faced with a difficult decision when it came to the annual holiday bonus for its employees. 

The CEO, Martha, called for a company-wide virtual meeting to deliver the sobering news. In her heartfelt speech, she announced that the company was apologetic for not being able to pay the holiday bonus to employees. She explained that the decision was a tough one and was taken only after exhausting all other cost-cutting alternatives. The announcement was met with disappointment, but Martha's honesty and transparency also earned her the respect of her employees. 

To soften the blow, Martha promised that the company would make up for the loss as soon as the financial situation improved. Despite the news, the employees took it in stride, understanding the difficulties faced by the company in these challenging times. The incident, although unfortunate, created a deeper bond among the employees and reinforced their commitment to the company.","A. From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.
B. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
C. For the past four years, I have had an exceptional journey at the university, a time characterized by thrilling encounters, rigorous studies, profound self-discovery, and formation of enduring friendships. My journey in college has been more than just an academic pursuit. It was a period of intense personal growth where I learned to celebrate victories, nurse failures, question norms, and seek knowledge beyond the confines of textbooks.

Tomorrow, however, marks a significant milestone in my life as I prepare for my graduation. It is a bittersweet moment as I reminisce on the camaraderie built with my peers during late-night study sessions and the exhilarating cheers from the crowd during inter-college sports events. I fondly recall the deep discussions with my professors that moulded my thoughts, the laughter that echoed through the dorm rooms, and even the stress of meeting assignment deadlines which taught me resilience and time management.

However, as I prepare to bid goodbye to this familiar space, the realization sets in that the journey was not just about reaching the destination, but more importantly, it was about the experiences gathered along the way. As I step out of college, I feel well-equipped to navigate the next chapter of my life with the lessons I have learned, the values I have developed and the dreams I have nurtured within these walls.

Our friend group had a long-standing tradition of watching newly released movies every Friday. However, last Friday was different. I was swamped with work, Jason fell sick, and Lisa had an unexpected family gathering, leaving Sam alone for the weekly movie outing.

Despite the unusual circumstances, Sam's enthusiasm for movies was undeterred. She went to watch the latest thriller, a movie we had all been waiting for. The moment she returned, our group chat was abuzz with messages, everyone impatiently waiting for a detailed review of the film.

""Let Sam share the story of the movie herself as she was the one who went to watch it,"" said Lisa in the group chat, echoing everyone's anticipation.

We all agreed, quickly setting up a video call so that Sam could relay the story in detail. As she began narrating the plot, her excitement filled the digital room. It was a unique experience, hearing the story directly from Sam, and while we missed being there, we were glad that our Friday movie tradition lived on.
B. John and his wife, Liza, had long awaited the arrival of a little one. Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

Liza would often find him sitting quietly in the room, staring at the beautifully painted walls with a distant look in his eyes. But no matter what the adoption agency's decision turned out to be, John was determined that the room would not go in vain, it would be a sanctuary of hope, a testament to their love and longing for a child.

Mike understood, nodded, and agreed to work on his presentation immediately. While I wished I could have granted his request immediately, I knew the hard truth of our profession: our work had to come first before personal pursuits.
D. Dr. Stevenson, a renowned neurosurgeon, had an important surgery scheduled the next day, a complex brain procedure that required his full concentration and skill. Aware of the gravity of the operation, he decided to dedicate the entire day before to preparing both mentally and physically. In order to do this, he needed an environment free from any distractions, no matter how insignificant they might seem.

He called a brief meeting with his staff, comprised of dedicated nurses, young eager interns, and experienced assistants. The doctor explained the nature of the surgery, a meticulous procedure that could significantly change his patient's life. He expressed his need for quiet and uninterrupted focus for his preparation.

""Tomorrow's operation is a challenging one,"" Dr. Stevenson told his team, his voice steady and commanding respect. ""I would like to ask you not to interrupt me with any minor tasks today, unless it is a critical issue."" 

The staff listened intently and understood the seriousness of his request. They promised to uphold their roles efficiently so the doctor could fully concentrate on the impending procedure. Dr. Stevenson nodded, pleased with his team's commitment, and retired to his office to start his comprehensive preparation for the critical surgery.",C,"s.

250,She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?.,"Amelia Davis was a hard-hitting political figure known throughout the Golden State. A vibrant and charismatic woman, she had a knack for captivating anyone with her words and was always at the forefront of the political scene. In short, she was a renowned representative of California. But as she walked into the bustling coffee shop one rainy Tuesday morning, she noticed that no one gave her a second glance.

Her friend, John, a visiting politician from Arizona, was bewildered by this. He had expected some form of recognition, a nod of acknowledgment at the very least. He turned to the barista and exclaimed in disbelief, ""She's a representative of California for crying out loud! How do you not recognize her?""

The barista, a teenager with pink hair and numerous piercings, simply shrugged. ""Sorry, man, I just moved here from Ohio,"" she said, already turning to take the next customer's order. John was dumbfounded; Amelia merely chuckled at the welcome anonymity.","A. Once, in a small town on the outskirts of Ohio, there lived a scruffy old man named Albert. Everyone in town considered him a poor, miserable tramp based on his shaggy appearance. They would often mock him and disregard any words of wisdom that came from him, believing that someone looking like him couldn't possibly have anything valuable to share.

Meanwhile, a charismatic man named Steve moved into town. He had an attractive appearance, always dressed in expensive suits, and drove a flashy sports car. Naturally, people flocked to Steve, assuming his good looks and wealthy demeanor meant he was a successful, intelligent, and trustworthy person.

However, this outward disparity could not have been more deceptive. For beneath Albert's rugged appearance lay a heart of gold and a mind brimming with experience and wisdom. Steve, on the other hand, was a swindler who manipulated people with his good looks, charming away their savings.

This tale served as a stark reminder to the townsfolk: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can indeed be deceptive.
B. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide.

C. Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.
D. Gary had always been passionate about nurturing things, which gradually led to a love for gardening. As a professional baseball player, he had little time to indulge in this passion of his during the active seasons. It was during the off season, he decided to invest both his time and money into creating a small garden for himself.

Gary purchased various seeds, gardening tools and started laboring in his backyard, tirelessly. Over time, his backyard began to reflect his hard work. A neat little garden with budding greens started taking shape, bringing him immense joy.

But as the winter months began to roll in, he noticed that his garden was not faring as well as he had imagined. The lack of ample sunlight and warmth was affecting the growth of his plants. It was at that point that Gary felt a pang of regret.

He wished he had started planning and working on his garden during the spring and summer seasons when the plants would have enjoyed optimal conditions for growth. The plants would have been more visible, lush, and healthy. Despite the regret, Gary was not disheartened. He was now better prepared for the next season and eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to enhance his garden.",B,C.
251,Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.,"Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.","A. George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.
B. Jacob sat down next to me at our favorite local café, an anxious look stretched across his face. He was contemplating a big decision - an opportunity to move across the country for a new job. I looked at him, sipping my coffee, and said, ""You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.""

He looked puzzled, not fully understanding what I meant. I explained further, ""Think about it, Jacob. Here, you know the market, you have your network, and the comfort of your home. This familiarity provides you with more options and opportunities."" 

Suddenly, his anxious look eased a bit. He knew the decision wouldn't be easy, but the wisdom behind the advice resonated with him. Jacob decided to dedicate himself to the opportunities at hand, vowing to work harder and seize every chance before making the big move. He understood then that once he moved, everything would change, and he needed to prepare for that inevitability.
C. In the heart of the bustling city of Washington D.C, a young and ambitious senator, John, received an urgent call. His assistant, Martha, breathlessly told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate."" John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward. When he finally arrived at the Senate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had heeded Martha's advice and left immediately.
D. ""I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is!"" I exclaimed, incredulous that my American cousin, Ben, didn't recognize such a prominent name. Ben, having been raised on American football, had only a passing acquaintance with the world of soccer. 

""He is one of the greatest football players alive,"" I told him, trying to impress upon him the importance of Ronaldo. Ben shrugged, appearing only mildly interested. ""Football, as in soccer?"" he asked, and I nodded, astonished at his lack of knowledge.

""Let me paint a picture for you,"" I started, desperately trying to bridge the cultural gap between us. ""Ronaldo is to football what Michael Jordan is to basketball. He's a phenomenon, a once-in-a-generation player, who has taken the sport to new levels with his skill, athleticism, and sheer determination.""

""His speed, his agility, his ability to control the ball as if it was an extension of his own body, is unmatched,"" I continued. ""And that’s why he is considered a legend.""

The thought of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane sends a shiver down my spine. I've always had an intense fear of heights and losing control, so the idea of skydiving brings both of my fears together in an adrenaline-fueled free fall. My palms start to sweat just thinking about the wind roaring in my ears as the ground quickly approaches.

Despite my terror, there is a small, stubborn part of me that is oddly intrigued. It speaks to me about courage, about a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and most of all, the adrenaline rush that would undoubtedly overshadow any other feeling. This curiosity, this yearning for an unforgettable adventure, has me seriously contemplating facing my fear head-on.

I never thought I'd seriously consider it, yet now I find myself continually drawn to the idea. The appeal of pushing my boundaries, overcoming my fears, and experiencing the ultimate thrill is slowly getting stronger than my fear. I am absolutely terrified of skydiviving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.
B. Every day I would tell my roommate, Jimmy, ""Show some respect to your professor! He is a legend in his field."" However, Jimmy, always nonchalant, continued to slack off in Professor Thompson's literature class. Professor Thompson was a man of great intellect and was highly regarded in the world of English literature. He had authored several critically acclaimed books and countless research papers. 

Yet, Jimmy would often miss his class, ignoring the profundity of the knowledge that the professor imparted. One day, after Jimmy received another failing grade, I arranged a meeting with Professor Thompson. He explained that he had been trying to reach out to Jimmy, concerned about his performance. I revealed to him Jimmy's disinterest, to which he simply sighed and said, ""I just want him to respect the opportunity to learn. We have to value those willing to share their knowledge.""

From then, I did my best to make Jimmy understand. I shared stories of the professor's achievements, his fame, and how lucky we were to have such a person teaching us. It took a while, but one day, Jimmy finally decided to attend Professor Thompson's class with a newfound respect.
C. From the outside looking in, the life of royals seems absolutely enchanting. The lavish parties, glamorous clothing, and adoring public give off an impression of a fairy-tale existence. Yet, behind the golden palace gates and beneath the jewel-encrusted crowns, the reality is far from this romantic image.

In truth, the daily life of a royal is dictated by endless duties and responsibilities. They are constantly under public scrutiny, with every action dissected and discussed by media across the globe. Personal privacy is a luxury they cannot afford, and the pressures can be truly crippling.

At times, the royal life is a lonely one. It is not often that they can form genuine, trusting relationships outside of their royal circles, as they never know who might exploit their status for personal gain. The constant need to appear perfect, composed, and graceful can also weigh heavily on their minds, potentially leading to deep-seated issues of self-doubt and insecurity.

This is the stark reality of royal life: while it appears to be all luxury and glamour from afar, it is not always as happy and fun as it may seem.
D. Over the past few weeks, the city was riveted by the high-profile case of a business mogul accused of fraud. It wasn't just another legal case, this was something that had held everyone's interest, given the stature of the individual involved. Word had been floating around that the mogul's defense was falling apart. But today, whispers filled the courtroom with a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown. It wasn't just a rumor, the buzz was everywhere - the coffee shops, the corridors of the courthouse, and even on live television reports. The news was intriguing - an unexpected turn in a case that seemed almost closed.

A hush fell over the courtroom as the defense lawyer rose, his face etched with a cryptic smile. He called upon the surprise eyewitness, who entered the room with a confident stride. With the appearance of this unexpected character, it seemed like the course of the trial was about to change drastically, adding a completely new dimension to the narrative. Everyone was on edge, wondering what revelations this newfound witness would unfold.",B,"# 1. The first step in creating a successful landing page is to define your target audience.

Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.
B. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.

D. Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick. To sell his story, he even shared details of a make-believe doctor's visit and incessantly discussed his fictional symptoms. This charade continued for an entire week while his boss unknowingly covered his workload. 

Upon his return, Andy confidently strolled into the office, expecting his little ruse to have gone undetected.

In a short, tense meeting, Mrs. Thompson voiced her disappointment and warned Andy about his position in the company, reminding him that trustworthiness was critical.

Living with a roommate can be challenging, especially when it comes to housekeeping responsibilities. Jeremy found this out the hard way when he moved in with Mark. Just because his roommate, Mark, never cleaned up after himself, didn't mean Jeremy should too. Jeremy was raised with strong values of cleanliness and organisation.

At first, he tried to cope with the mess, hoping Mark would eventually pick up his clothes, wash his dishes, and take out the garbage. But as time went by, Jeremy realized that this change was unlikely to happen. Mark's careless attitude towards cleanliness was beginning to irk him. He decided not to let his roommate's bad habits influence him, he didn't want to lower his standards.

One day, he took it upon himself to discuss the situation with Mark, expressing his feelings about the ongoing mess. After a lengthy discussion, Mark agreed to make more of an effort, promising that their shared space would be more livable, which showed Jeremy that standing up for cleanliness was indeed the right decision.
B. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.

A life filled with deadlines, alarm clocks, and office politics had left him feeling disillusioned. He yearned for the thrill and spontaneity that he had once enjoyed in his youth. And so, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job to pursue his hobbies.

Motorcycle racing and photography, both long forgotten passions, began to call out to him. The very next day, he handed in his resignation, allowing a sense of liberation to sweep over him. With his savings, he bought a brand new motorcycle and a professional camera. Every day was now an adventure, the open road and the perfect shot his new routine. Amidst the deafening sound of the motorcycle engine and the constant click of his camera, Chris found the joy that he had been searching for, redefining his life's purpose.

The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
255,Do you know who you're facing? That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!.,"""Excuse me, sir,"" a small voice spoke out, trembling and filled with anxiety. The audience turned their heads to the stage, trying to locate the source of the interruption. A slender young man stood there, nervously shifting from foot to foot. His eyes were wide and filled with fear as he focused his gaze on the towering figure before him. 

""Do you know who you're facing?"" the young man's coach hastily whispered from the sidelines, panic coursing through his veins. He pointed a shaky finger at the person towering over his student. ""That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!"" His voice was filled with a mix of awe and fear, as he gave a sidelong glance to his student.

The young man's heart pounded fiercely in his chest but he stood his ground, now aware of the gravity of the situation. The world champion or not, he was not going to back down without a fight. His mentor's warning words echoed in his head as he walked forward, stepping into the spotlight to face the world champion, prepared to give his all, to fight the greatest battle of his life.","A. Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.
B. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
C. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.
D. We had planned our day perfectly, every minute accounted for, so we could explore the city most efficiently. The main attraction was the city's renowned historical museum, and our excitement was palpable. We hustled in the morning, picking up our breakfast sandwiches and swiftly wolfing them down, darting to the bus stop with seconds to spare. Yet, despite our best efforts, we watched the bus pull away just as we rounded the corner. We missed the bus.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and frustration, we stood there panting, staring at the retreating bus. But my friend, always the optimist, broke the silence. ""Look, it serves no use to be angry about it right now, so let's walk,"" he suggested. He pointed at the map indicating it wasn't too far. It wasn't our plan, but we took this in our stride, turning the walk into an adventure of its own, exploring the streets and enjoying the unplanned detour in our otherwise well-scheduled day.",B,"```

256,"She knows he's lying to her, but she's choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation.","Rebecca has always prided herself on her perceptiveness. A gift she inherited from her mom, it was as if she had a sixth sense when it came to reading people. She could discern truth from untruth in a heartbeat. This ability became a source of torment when she met Mark, a charming yet evasive man who had now become her boyfriend. 

From the moment they started dating, Rebecca sensed Mark was a complex puzzle; a man with secrets. She would catch him in small lies, minor details that didn't add up, contradictions in his past experiences, and the most alarming of all, his conveniently forgotten promises. Her instinct was screaming that he was lying to her, but Rebecca was conflicted.

Despite all of it, Rebecca loved Mark; he was sweet, caring, and made her feel cherished. Though she was aware of her boyfriend's deception, she decided to turn a blind eye. She chose to love him for his positives and let the shadows of his dishonesty lurk unnoticed, at least for now.","A. Walter sat in the library, the daunting exam paper in front of him. His palms were sweaty, his mind in a whirlwind. Despite his best efforts, when the scores came back, he found that he'd failed his crucial exam. He had studied days and nights, given up on his football matches, sacrificed his social life, all in hopes of acing this test. 

His heart pounding in his chest, he trudged home, dreading the moment he had to reveal his failure to his father. Upon his arrival, he steeled himself and blurted out his poor results. Instead of the feared outrage, his father calmly listened, looked him in the eyes, and finally said, ""Son, don't cry over spilt milk."" 

Walter looked at his father in astonishment, expecting more reprimand. But his father just patted his shoulder with a gentle smile, and he understood - it was just a failed exam, not the end of his life. His father's simple words and composed reaction taught Walter the significant life lesson that there is no point in being upset over things that have already happened and cannot be changed.
B. Sally had always been aware of her circumstances with Scott. In fact, she had thought through it again and again, turning it over in her mind like a coin inspecting all of its facets. She knew perfectly well that their situation was a complicated one; rife with obstacles that most would find insurmountable. Scott was married, he had children, he was also her boss.

Despite these reasons, there was an inexplicable connection that drew her towards him. Their mutual feelings for each other were undeniable, and while they made their relationship more complicated, they also made it more valuable. She saw the way he looked at her, the subtle signs of love and affection that were there for anyone observant enough to notice. 

Choosing to be with him wasn't an easy decision; it was a conscious choice she made, knowing full well the potential consequences. Sally wasn't clueless nor naive about what she was getting into. She simply decided that, for her, love was worth risking the circumstances.
C. Mary had a fond affection for dogs and had adopted two, Charlie and Lucy. Charlie was a large, energetic labrador while Lucy was a playful, medium-sized collie. Together, they brought a lot of joy and sometimes chaos to Mary's life. However, one thing that bothered Mary was that her dear pets did not have a proper place to rest or shelter.

She had been dreaming of a comfortable and spacious dog house for them, an oasis where they could retreat in the middle of their fun-filled day. However, building a large dog house was not something within Peter's financial capacity. He had been working hard but money seemed to just slip out of his hands like sand. Yet, he knew how much it meant for Mary to give Charlie and Lucy a cozy home.

With a spark of an idea, Mary decided not to rely on Peter's wallet, but on her creativity and resourcefulness. With a bunch of old cardboard boxes she had kept from moving in, Mary set to work, designing and building a large, multi-roomed dog house for Charlie and Lucy, making the best out of what they had at their disposal.
D. For as long as they had known each other, Sam had been supportive, understanding, and incredibly patient with Peter. They shared many moments together, both good and bad, which had made them close friends. Despite the ups and downs in their friendship, Sam had always tried to be a good friend to Peter. She was willing to look past Peter's idiosyncrasies, as that's what friends do.

However, one day, Peter crossed a line. During one of their usual chats, he started making fun of Sam's insecurities. Sam had confided in him about her fears and self-doubts, trusting him not to use them against her. But Peter decided to poke fun at them, laughing at her apprehensions while completely disregarding her feelings.

The hurtful incident made Sam reassess their friendship. She decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore, realizing that a true friend would not use her vulnerabilities as a source of amusement. From then on, Sam distanced herself from Peter, deciding to surround herself with people who respected her feelings and insecurities.",B,"```

257,"Garry knows he is underpaid, but he chooses not to focus on it as he is more than happy to have a job.","Garry is a content and humble man. He is employed at a local grocery store where he works diligently. Despite knowing he is underpaid compared to others in similar positions, Garry is not a man of many demands. He doesn't chase after the luxuries of life but rather is satisfied with the simple pleasures it offers. 

The thought that he is underpaid is always somewhere in the corner of his mind. Yet he willingly chooses not to focus on it. His outlook is rather optimistic. To him, having a stable job to pay his bills and live comfortably is a blessing in itself. Moreover, his work brings him a sense of purpose and satisfaction, something he values more than a hefty paycheck. Garry believes in the joy of working and being able to sustain himself, this makes him more than happy to have a job despite being underpaid.","A. Jessica tossed her long, blonde hair over her shoulder, glancing at her friend with a mixture of disbelief and concern. ""How can you expect not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all, Sarah?"" she questioned, eyes wide with worry. Sarah merely shrugged, a casual dismissal that sent a jolt of anxiety through Jessica.

""You're so smart, Jess. I’m sure I can borrow your notes before the test,"" Sarah said nonchalantly, leaning back on the library chair. Jessica stared back at her, the weight of her friend's careless attitude causing a crease between her eyebrows.

She loved Sarah dearly, but her consistent lack of dedication had always been a source of contention between them. ""That's not the point, Sarah."" Jessica replied, a hint of frustration seeping into her voice. ""You need to start taking your studies seriously.""

Sarah simply gave her a dismissive wave, a clear sign that she had no intention of heeding her advice. Jessica sighed deeply, closing her books and looking at her friend with disappointment, unsure of how to make Sarah understand the importance of studying.
B. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
C. Professor Johnson sat at his desk, flipping through the pile of homework assignments that had been submitted. As he glanced through them, he noticed a striking similarity amongst them; it was as if the students had all copied from one another. He knew he had a reputation as a strict professor, but he also prided himself on being fair and understanding.

One particular sentence kept reappearing in the assignments, word for word. It was an obscure quote from a lesser-known scientist that he mentioned briefly in one of his lectures. He recognized this as a sign that the majority of students had collaborated in doing their homework.

The normal procedure would be to report the incident to the academic integrity board of the university, but Professor Johnson decided against it. He felt that it was an indication that the students were under intense pressure and perhaps they needed to be encouraged rather than punished.

Instead of penalizing the students, he decided to use the situation as a teaching moment. The next day, he brought up the copied sentence in class, discussed the ethics and implications of plagiarism, and gave the students an opportunity to redo the assignment. While he wished to maintain academic integrity, he also understood that everyone deserved a second chance.
D. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.",C,"```

It wasn't just another legal case, this was something that had held everyone's interest, given the stature of the individual involved. Word had been floating around that the mogul's defense was falling apart. But today, whispers filled the courtroom with a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

I've heard that the defense lawyer has a fresh eyewitness who was previously unknown. It wasn't just a rumor, the buzz was everywhere - the coffee shops, the corridors of the courthouse, and even on live television reports. The news was intriguing - an unexpected turn in a case that seemed almost closed.

A hush fell over the courtroom as the defense lawyer rose, his face etched with a cryptic smile. He called upon the surprise eyewitness, who entered the room with a confident stride. With the appearance of this unexpected character, it seemed like the course of the trial was about to change drastically, adding a completely new dimension to the narrative. Everyone was on edge, wondering what revelations this newfound witness would unfold.
B. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
C. After four long, grueling years of pursuing her degree, Emily finally graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. However, unlike her peers who immediately started their hunt for jobs, Emily made a choice that left many puzzled. She decided she was not going to put herself through the stress of job hunting. Emily had been an exceptional student and certainly had the credentials for any high paying job in her field. However, her heart was set on something different; something that many considered risky and unconventional. 

Emily chose to put her career on hold and decided to invest her time in traveling and painting. She longed for the freedom of a bohemian life, exploring new places and capturing the beauty of the world on her canvas. Her decision was met with skepticism by many, but Emily was undeterred. She had earned her freedom after years of laborious study and now was the time to enjoy it. The thought of experiencing new cultures and translating them onto her canvas excited Emily more than any high-paying job could ever do.

Their friendship had always been rocky, filled with competitive banter and rivalry. Over time, Jeremy realized Rick's friendship wasn't as genuine as it seemed. Rick was more inclined towards the glitz of wealth and constantly pursued money. He was the kind of person who'd turn his back on his friends if it meant getting a bigger piece of the pie. 

Despite this, Jeremy didn't cut ties with Rick. He was aware that Rick's intentions were shallow and centered around his own self-interest. Nonetheless, Jeremy decided to continue his friendship with Rick, albeit with more caution and less trust. He figured he could manage to get along with him for the time being, at least until the dynamics of their relationship changed. It was a harsh reality to accept but Jeremy found comfort in the knowledge that he understood Rick's motives and could navigate their relationship accordingly.","A. John had amassed a fortune beyond anyone's wildest dreams. His sumptuous mansion in the heart of the city was more than a sight to behold, exhibiting his abundance to the world. People looked on with mouths agape, their minds brewing a storm of envy. They whispered about his luxury cars and the expensive, handcrafted watches that always adorned his wrist. Expensive holidays and lavish parties were a normal part of John's life, further fueling the envy that others harbored.

However, amidst his riches and opulence, John was steeped in solitude. His grand mansion echoed with loneliness, the spaces too big to be filled by materialistic belongings. He dined alone, traveled alone, and the only laughter that filled his house was from the television shows he watched. His heart ached for companionship, for someone to share his success and wealth with. For all his money and material possessions, he had nobody to share the small, mundane joys of life; making him realize that wealth without companionship is just as bad as poverty.

C. For as long as I can remember, my family has always opted for the safe choices. We frequented the same restaurants, purchased the same brands of clothing, and even vacationed at the same locations year after year. When it came to sweets, the story was no different. We always bought the same caramel candies that we had been accustomed to, never daring to venture beyond the familiar taste.

One day, while grocery shopping, I noticed a new range of sweets displayed prominently on the shelf. They boasted exotic flavors and vibrant packaging, promising a better and richer taste. For a moment, I was tempted to try them. However, the old adage echoed in my mind: ""Better to buy the sweets we are accustomed to than to try the new ones that might taste better.""

I smiled and reached out for our usual pack of caramel candies, resisting the alluring temptation. This was our tradition, our comfort, and while the unknown held the promise of something potentially better, I realized it was the familiarity and memories associated with our regular sweets that made them truly special.
D. Your best friend, Lilly, had a bad habit of procrastinating her schoolwork. Today, she texted you excitedly, saying she was heading to the luxury spa downtown instead of dealing with her mounting pile of assignments. You stared at her message, considering the possibility of joining her for a much-needed stress relief session. However, your own stack of homework caught your attention.

You remembered your mom's stern words from before, ""Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too."" You knew she was right, but the idea of ditching your homework for a moment of relaxation tempted you. You found yourself battling internally, a part of you yearning for the spa's tranquility and another part reminding you of your responsibilities.

You decided to reply to Lilly, wishing her a fun spa day and letting her know that you wouldn't be able to make it. As you settled down to your homework, you felt a strange sense of satisfaction, knowing that you were doing what was right for you. And while the spa could offer temporary comfort, finishing your homework would ultimately lead to long-term success and peace of mind.",B,".

The normal procedure would be to report the incident to the academic integrity board of the university, but Professor Johnson decided against it. He felt that it was an indication that the students were under intense pressure and perhaps they needed to be encouraged rather than punished.

Instead of penalizing the students, he decided to use the situation as a teaching moment. The next day, he brought up the copied sentence in class, discussed the ethics and implications of plagiarism, and gave the students an opportunity to redo the assignment. While he wished to maintain academic integrity, he also understood that everyone deserved a second chance.","A. Rebecca has always prided herself on her perceptiveness. A gift she inherited from her mom, it was as if she had a sixth sense when it came to reading people. She could discern truth from untruth in a heartbeat. This ability became a source of torment when she met Mark, a charming yet evasive man who had now become her boyfriend. 

From the moment they started dating, Rebecca sensed Mark was a complex puzzle; a man with secrets. She would catch him in small lies, minor details that didn't add up, contradictions in his past experiences, and the most alarming of all, his conveniently forgotten promises. Her instinct was screaming that he was lying to her, but Rebecca was conflicted.

Despite all of it, Rebecca loved Mark; he was sweet, caring, and made her feel cherished. Though she was aware of her boyfriend's deception, she decided to turn a blind eye. She chose to love him for his positives and let the shadows of his dishonesty lurk unnoticed, at least for now.
B. Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it. My heart pounding in my chest will slowly become a normal rhythm, my fear will turn into a certain caution, and my journey, a routine I follow, unfazed. The darkness won't be a cause for terror anymore. Instead, the quiet streets will make me feel independent and strong.
C. Linda had always been a reserved woman, with her emotions often kept in check and concealed beneath a cordial smile. However, she was different in her own home, especially when she was around her husband, Tom. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around; her stiff exterior softens, her subtle smile widens, and her eyes brighten.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.
D. Living in the small northern town of Kjørnes, Norway, the residents understood the value of sunlight more than anyone else. It's a stark difference between the sunny days of summer and the fleeting daylight of the harsh winter. Hence, they were always thankful for the sunshine that graced their town during the brief but beautiful summer. The phrase, ""Be thankful for the sunshine this summer because it only appears briefly during the winter,"" echoed in every gathering, reminding everyone to soak in as much sun as they possibly could.

This summer was no exception. As the sun rose in the bright blue sky, children would rush out of their homes to play, their laughter ringing through the peaceful town. The adults spent their time gardening, enjoying the feeling of warmth on their skin. Barbecues, picnics, and sunbathing became the town's pastime, bringing a vibrant energy that only came with the summer sunshine.

However, as the days began to shorten, a sense of urgency hung in the air. They knew that they needed to cherish every sunbeam, every light-filled day, as they would soon retreat to a world of ice and darkness. Regardless, they remained resilient, embracing the inevitable winter, while always looking forward to the next summer’s sunshine.",A,#B
261,"Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.","Lisa loved her books like they were her own children. She had a dedicated room filled with shelves stacked with every kind of book imaginable. From classic literature to edgy, contemporary novels, her library was her personal sanctuary.

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation. This incident made Lisa realize that she had to set boundaries for her library, even with her closest friends.","A. She had been working tirelessly on a high-profile project for her company. Every day for weeks, she would wake up before sunrise and go to sleep way past midnight. Her mind constantly buzzed with deadlines, strategies, and implementations. While she loved her work, the intensity of this project started to take a toll on her mental and physical well-being.

Her face became gaunt, dark circles took permanent residency under her eyes, and her once jovem spirit started to feel weary. She could see her performance declining, mistakes slipping in her work that she would have never made before. The realization hit her hard; she was severely exhausted.

Something had to change. Thus, she decided to take a break and prioritize her health. She requested a month off work, packed her favorite books and clothes, and flew to a tropical island for a well-deserved vacation to rejuvenate herself.
B. There once was a mischievous boy, living in a small village nestled against a foreboding forest, who took great delight in tricking his fellow villagers. To pass the time, he would call out, ""Wolf! Wolf!"", feigning distress, causing the hard-working villagers to drop everything to come to his aid. He would then laugh, and his laughter echoed throughout the peaceful valley, disrupting the quiet serenity that usually prevailed. This happened time and time again, until the villagers started to lose patience with the little boy's pranks. 

One cold winter day, the boy, emboldened by past success, repeated his false cry. But this time, nobody hurried to his rescue, weary of his previous false alarms. Unbeknownst to them, however, this time, the cry was authentic. A pack of starving wolves had strayed from the forest, drawn by the scent of the village's livestock. The boy was terrified as the fierce creatures came closer and closer, his desperate cries for help fading into the chilling wind. Ultimately, the boy who cried wolf learned a grave and costly lesson, earning his comeuppance the day the wolves really came.
C. Jeremy had known Rick for years, ever since they were young boys playing football on the neighborhood streets. Their friendship had always been rocky, filled with competitive banter and rivalry. Over time, Jeremy realized Rick's friendship wasn't as genuine as it seemed. Rick was more inclined towards the glitz of wealth and constantly pursued money. He was the kind of person who'd turn his back on his friends if it meant getting a bigger piece of the pie. 

Despite this, Jeremy didn't cut ties with Rick. He was aware that Rick's intentions were shallow and centered around his own self-interest. Nonetheless, Jeremy decided to continue his friendship with Rick, albeit with more caution and less trust. He figured he could manage to get along with him for the time being, at least until the dynamics of their relationship changed. It was a harsh reality to accept but Jeremy found comfort in the knowledge that he understood Rick's motives and could navigate their relationship accordingly.
D. John was always an adventurous soul, constantly in search of new thrills. This time, he had decided to conquer the steep, rocky terrain of the Rocky Mountains. It was a bright sunny day and the conditions seemed perfect for his climbing expedition.

He had almost reached the top when his foot slipped on a loose piece of rock. Just at the edge of the cliff, he found himself teetering precariously, his heart pounding against his chest. Panic threatened to seize him as he felt the rocky ground crumble beneath his grip. 

But in an act of quick thinking, he managed to hold on to a sturdy rock protruding from the edge. His fingers ached from the pressure as he struggled to pull himself up. Just as his strength was about to give out, a strong hand reached out, clutching him securely. It was his friend, Mike, who had reached the top first and was now saving John in the nick of time. It was a close call, a brush with death, but John was saved, left with an adrenaline rush and a newfound respect for the mountains.",C,s 20120202020202020202020202020202202020200202000
262,"She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","Alena was a quiet and introverted girl in her senior year of high school. She was consistently seen in the library or the laboratory, completely immersed in her books. She was never a part of the overly flamboyant crowd, the ones who enjoyed boasting about their intelligence, their latest scores, and achievements. In contrast to them, Alena had a calm, poised demeanor.

People often underestimated her due to her unassuming personality. Even her teachers were unaware of the prodigy that hid beneath her humble exterior. Her friends, however, knew about her dedication, about the late-night study sessions and countless revisions she put into her preparation for the board exams.

The result day arrived, and everyone held their breath in anticipation. The school's top rank was taken by the usual, boastful scholar. However, when Alena's name was announced for the second position, the hall echoed with surprise and admiration. She never bragged about her grades but secured the second position in the board exams. Truly, actions speak louder than words.","A. Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.
B. My daughter, Sophia, is the apple of my eye but has a tendency to stir up some mischief, particularly in the afternoons when she has no specific tasks or activities to keep her occupied. If she has nothing else to do, she invariably ends up creating problems for my mom. I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.
C. Ever since I can remember, I've yearned for a place to call my own. The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize. 

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

However, I've come to terms with my situation, understanding that this is just a stepping stone towards achieving my dream. I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate.
D. Once upon a time, I lived next to a somewhat eccentric individual named Bob. Now, Bob had this colossal oak tree that leaned precariously towards my property, dropping leaves and acorns on my freshly mowed lawn, which clearly ruffled my feathers. One day, I decided to approach Bob about this minor annoyance, advising him to trim his tree. Bob, being somewhat stubborn, refused. I knew I had a few choices, but I felt it was better to compromise with my neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball. 

So, I proposed a compromise where we could split the cost of a professional tree service to get the tree trimmed. Initially, Bob was reluctant but he soon agreed when I explained how this would not only benefit me but also prevent potential damage to his property. To my relief, this proposition settled the friction between us. In the end, both of our properties looked better and I learned the invaluable lesson of compromise. Through that, Bob and I even became quite friendly, proving that even the most trying circumstances can result in unexpectedly positive outcomes.",A,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions.

George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.
B. Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.
C. Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.
D. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.",B,s 2012016 2016 2018 2016 2018 2016 2016 2016 2016 2016 2016 2016 216 21 21 21111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
264,She posted a lot about her friendship with Mary on Instagram. But in reality they hardly had any bond as they were constantly on their phones when together.,"Once a darling of social media, Cynthia was known for her vivacious pictures and exciting updates. She always had a knack for creating a fascinating virtual life, which drew thousands of followers. One of the most prominent features of her Instagram was her seemingly unshakeable friendship with Mary. Their matching outfits, their Friday night pizza outings, and the signature duo selfies, all painted the perfect image of a loyal bond.

However, the true scenario was a striking contrast to the vibrant pictures posted online. In reality, Cynthia and Mary shared an utterly superficial bond. Their meet-ups were mostly marked by silence, interrupted only by the constant clicking of their phone cameras. Instead of making genuine conversations, they were more involved with capturing the best moments for their Instagram.

Their shared love for social media had somehow eclipsed the need for forming a real bond. Both had fallen prey to the attraction of the digital world, swapping meaningful friendship for a fake image. It was the irony of their bond - known as best friends online, but strangers when the screens were put away.","A. Even though it took me two weeks, I at least sent the letter. This wasn't just any letter, it was a letter of apology that took me countless drafts and revisions to get just right. I'd been wrestling with my feelings for so long, knowing I had wronged a dear friend and not knowing how to mend the damage.

Night after night, I poured my thoughts and remorse onto paper, only to crumple it up and throw it away. The words never seemed to adequately express my regret. The sense of shame and guilt gnawed at my conscience every day. I was on edge, wondering if the friendship I had ruined would ever be salvaged.

Finally, after two grueling weeks, I had a version I was somewhat satisfied with. I remember walking to the post office with a trembling hand, slipping the envelope into the mailbox, feeling a strange sense of relief mixed with apprehension. I knew I had done my part in seeking forgiveness, and all that was left was to hope my friend would understand.
B. After a long day at work, Sam staggered out of his office towards the parking lot. He unlocked his car, throwing his briefcase onto the backseat before sinking into the driver's seat. However, when he inserted his keys and turned on the ignition, all he heard was a sputtering noise. He tried again, but the car refused to come to life, only giving out faint, distressed sounds.

With a sinking feeling, he glanced at the fuel gauge. It was on empty. A frustrated groan escaped his lips as he remembered passing the gas station earlier, opting not to stop, thinking he had enough fuel to last the trip home. He now realized how wrong he was. ""I guess I've learned the hard way,"" he muttered, reaching for his phone to call a tow truck. ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""
C. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.

B. John and Sarah had been married for five years. The initial honeymoon phase faded away, and they started noticing each other's flaws and quirks. Small issues like not putting the toilet seat down or forgetting to pick up groceries on the way home, which used to go unnoticed, were now turning into a cause of frequent squabbles.

One day, their mutual friend Mike noticed the tension between them. He advised them to address and resolve these small issues before they grow into bigger problems. Mike reminded them of the love they shared and suggested focusing on open communication to understand each other's perspective.

Taking Mike's advice to heart, John and Sarah started resolving each small issue immediately instead of letting it fester. They openly discussed their expectations, frustrations, and found ways to compromise. Over time, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their relationship. This made them realize that resolving small issues immediately indeed prevented bigger troubles down the road.
C. Professor Johnson sat at his desk, flipping through the pile of homework assignments that had been submitted. As he glanced through them, he noticed a striking similarity amongst them; it was as if the students had all copied from one another. He knew he had a reputation as a strict professor, but he also prided himself on being fair and understanding.

One particular sentence kept reappearing in the assignments, word for word. It was an obscure quote from a lesser-known scientist that he mentioned briefly in one of his lectures. He recognized this as a sign that the majority of students had collaborated in doing their homework.

The normal procedure would be to report the incident to the academic integrity board of the university, but Professor Johnson decided against it. He felt that it was an indication that the students were under intense pressure and perhaps they needed to be encouraged rather than punished.

Instead of penalizing the students, he decided to use the situation as a teaching moment. The next day, he brought up the copied sentence in class, discussed the ethics and implications of plagiarism, and gave the students an opportunity to redo the assignment. While he wished to maintain academic integrity, he also understood that everyone deserved a second chance.
D. Jacob sat down next to me at our favorite local café, an anxious look stretched across his face. He was contemplating a big decision - an opportunity to move across the country for a new job. I looked at him, sipping my coffee, and said, ""You wouldn't have these options once you move across the country, so work hard while you are here.""

He looked puzzled, not fully understanding what I meant. I explained further, ""Think about it, Jacob. Here, you know the market, you have your network, and the comfort of your home. This familiarity provides you with more options and opportunities."" 

Suddenly, his anxious look eased a bit. He knew the decision wouldn't be easy, but the wisdom behind the advice resonated with him. Jacob decided to dedicate himself to the opportunities at hand, vowing to work harder and seize every chance before making the big move.

Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.","A. Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.
B. Sharon and Mark were once a picture-perfect couple, deeply in love, admired by everyone around them for their romantic bond. But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce, learning every day that love and understanding always have the power to conquer even the toughest situations.
C. For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me. I had done it; I had conquered the spreadsheets, and most importantly, my fear of numbers.
D. Laura was a budding indie artist, preparing to release her much-anticipated debut album. She had spent countless hours crafting the perfect melodies and lyrics, pouring her heart and soul into each song. Critics and fans alike were waiting with bated breath, convinced that Laura's album would be nothing short of a masterpiece.

The album was a collection of fourteen songs, each one a poignant story, a tiny fragment of Laura's life converted into beautiful melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The first thirteen songs were nothing short of spectacular. They resonated with the listeners, reverberating with the collective human experiences of love, loss, and healing. Every note, every strum, and every beat filled the air with an irrefutable magic, making the audience sway and sing along.

But when the last song played, a distinct discomfort filled the room. It was an upbeat pop song, a stark contrast from the beautiful melancholic tunes that characterized the rest of the album. It felt out of place and jarring, breaking the emotive spell the album had cast. All the songs on her album were amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,#DearSoul #Motivation #Inspiration #LifeQuotes #QuoteOfTheDay #QuotesForSuccess #SuccessQuotes #MotivationMonday #MondayMotivation #MondayMotivationQuotes #MondayMotivation101 #MondayMotivationQuotes #MotivationalQuotes #MotivationalMonday #MotivationalMondayQuotes #MotivationalMonday101 #MotivationalMondayQuotes #InspirationalQuotes #InspirationalMonday #InspirationalMondayQuotes #InspirationalMonday101 #InspirationalMondayQuotes #SuccessMotivation #SuccessQuotes #SuccessMotivationQuotes #SuccessMonday #SuccessMondayQuotes #SuccessMonday101 #SuccessMondayQuotes

Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.
B. Jake, a friend of mine, had been trapped in the 12th grade for the last five years. His academic journey had been a rollercoaster ride, filled with numerous obstacles and failures. It seemed like the universe was conspiring to prevent Jake from achieving his dream of graduating high school. Every year, he would start the academic term with a fervor, attending classes, participating actively, and submitting all his assignments on time. 

However, as the school year wore on, he would lose his momentum, often finding himself unable to keep up with his classmates. This became a recurring pattern, earning him the dubious honor of being the oldest student in our grade. His spirit was dampened, but his determination to pass was unwavering. He enlisted tutors, spent countless hours studying and sought advice from previous graduates.

Finally, in his sixth attempt, the persistent efforts of Jake bore fruit. With a weary yet triumphant smile, Jake held up his high school diploma, finally succeeding to pass the 12th grade, proof that persistence and dedication can overcome even the toughest of hurdles.
C. Andy was an average, hardworking employee at a bustling IT firm. One day, he decided to play hooky from work, pretending he was sick. To sell his story, he even shared details of a make-believe doctor's visit and incessantly discussed his fictional symptoms. This charade continued for an entire week while his boss unknowingly covered his workload. 

Upon his return, Andy confidently strolled into the office, expecting his little ruse to have gone undetected. However, his boss, Mrs. Thompson, had been contacted by a mutual friend who had spotted Andy lounging on a beach during his supposed sick leave. In a short, tense meeting, Mrs. Thompson voiced her disappointment and warned Andy about his position in the company, reminding him that trustworthiness was critical.

Andy, realizing the severity of his actions, found himself teetering on very thin ice. His boss's rebuke had made clear that another transgression could cost him his job. Determined to make amends, Andy began formulating a plan to regain Mrs. Thompson's trust and save his reputation at work.
D. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.",D,"s of the world.

268,A forest grew near the river.,"Once upon a time, in a peaceful little valley, a thick forest grew near the meandering river. This was no ordinary forest; it was an enchanting mix of towering pines, emerald oaks, and myriad colorful wildflowers that danced in the wind. The river, a sparkling ribbon of blue, wound its way lazily through the forest, nourishing it with its life-giving water. Each morning, a shimmering mist would rise from the river and blanket the forest in a gentle, silvery haze.

Wildlife thrived in the forest, making the environment even more vibrant. Deer moved elegantly amongst the trees while the birds filled the air with their melodious songs. As night fell, the nocturnal creatures took over, filling the forest with their whispered conversations and soft scurrying. 

Just beyond the river, a small, picturesque village lay, inhabited by people who revered the forest and considered it a sacred entity. The villagers would often come to the river's edge to collect water, fish or simply marvel at the forest's tranquil beauty. Thus, life existed harmoniously in the quaint valley where the magical forest grew near the river.","A. Upon the release of the school's basketball team list, Tim was devastated to find his name absent from the roster. His hopes had been high, his dreams of playing as a power forward crashing down as reality set in - he hadn't made the cut. As he stood there in front of the gym, the basketball in his hand felt like a weight. His friends, other aspiring athletes, tried to console him, but their words were like hollow echoes in his disappointed mind. 

Barry, an older and wise friend who had graduated two years prior, happened to be visiting the school that day. He noticed Tim's gloomy expression and inquired about his sorrow. After hearing Tim's story, he shared his sympathetic understanding. However, Barry also offered him words of encouragement and wisdom. He advised Tim to stray away from his emotions, to not let this setback define him but instead to use it as motivation to work harder. Barry instilled hope in Tim, reminding him that there was always next year's tryout and an opportunity to come back stronger than ever.
B. George was an avid gardener, spending countless hours cultivating his beloved collection of rare flowers. Every morning, he would wake up at the crack of dawn to start his gardening routine. A vital part of this routine was ensuring that his garden got its daily supply of water, irrespective of the weather predictions. 

One day, the local news announced that there was rain in the forecast. George's neighbour, a novice gardener named Joe, decided to skip watering his garden that day, thinking the rain would be enough. He saw George watering his own garden and advised him to do the same, believing it was unnecessary given the upcoming downpour. 

But George, with a gentle smile, told Joe, ""Even if rain is on the forecast, keep watering your garden"". True enough, the rain that day was a mere drizzle, hardly enough to quench the thirsty plants. Joe's garden ended up suffering because of his decision to rely on the rain. Meanwhile, George's garden continued to thrive, teaching Joe a valuable lesson about the importance of consistent care.
C. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
D. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.",D,"#1. The first thing you need to know about the #2.

269,Many students came to study under the guru.,"In the quaint village of Anandpur nestled in the Himalayas, there lived a wise guru named Raghavendra. He was a renowned scholar, known far and wide for his wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual guidance. Word spread about Raghavendra's teachings and soon, students from all over the country began arriving to learn from him. Many students came to study under the guru, looking to gain enlightenment and pursue wisdom.

Among those students was a humble boy named Rohit, who had walked for days from his distant village to reach Anandpur. A thirst for knowledge had driven Rohit to undertake this journey. His village's elders had spoken highly of Raghavendra, painting him as a beacon of wisdom. Intrigued and eager, Rohit was one of the many who sought Raghavendra's tutelage.

B. During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.
C. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.
D. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.",D,D

In this part of town, hidden away behind the bustling city life, there are always guys trying to deceitfully pass off cheap watches as authentic Rolexes. These men, with their oil-slick smiles and flashy jackets, lurk in the darker corners of the street, peddling their phony goods to unsuspecting victims. Their spiel is always the same, promising a genuine luxury timepiece at a fraction of the typical retail price. They prey on the naive and the hopeful, those who dream of owning a piece of the high life but lack the financial means.

Over time, it became an unfortunate norm for locals and tourists alike, seeing people fall into this deceitful trap. There was one elderly man in particular, Mr. Brooks, a retired school teacher who had long admired the refined elegance of Rolex watches. His modest pension did not allow such extravagant purchases, but his desire for a Rolex never waned.

One day, a man in a cheap suit approached Mr. Brooks, presenting an opportunity that seemed too good to be true. In his trembling hands, he held a watch, claiming it to be a genuine Rolex, selling for an obscenely low price. Sadly, like many before him, Mr. Brooks fell for the deception, exchanging his hard-earned money for a watch that, in the harsh light of day, would prove to be nothing more than a cleverly designed forgery.

C. The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage. 

Despite the diversity of their subjects, a sense of camaraderie marked each group. United by shared interests, they were all part of the dynamic world of technology, bridging gaps and paving the way for a shared future.
D. Juli had always been fond of a particular towering oak tree in their backyard. It had been her favorite spot to read, and she had spent countless hours nestled in its sturdy branches. Then one day, a violent storm swept through their town, uprooting the mighty tree Juli loved so much. When Juli saw the tree in its fallen state, her heart ached with a sorrow that she could not put into words.

Understanding her sorrow, her father, who was a gifted artist, decided to immortalize the tree in a way only he could. He spent days working tirelessly, capturing every detail from the gnarled roots to the endless branches that had once reached towards the heavens. When he was done, he presented the painting to Juli with an apologetic smile.

He told her, ""There's nothing else we could do, Juli,"" his words full of empathy for his daughter's loss. The painting was a spectacular rendition of her favorite tree, standing tall and mighty just like how she remembered it. Juli found solace in her father's gift and realized that even though the tree had physically vanished from their backyard, it would forever remain alive in her heart and her father's masterpiece.",B,"A.

271,Mary collected so many books over the years that she eventually had enough to make her own library.,"Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.","A. Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
B. I had a particular craving for Italian food that evening. The rich taste of pasta tossed in the savory tomato sauce and the enticing aroma of the herbs was something I wanted to treat myself with. I checked my wallet and felt my heart sink. 

It was nearly empty, devoid of the cash I needed for such an expensive indulgence. The disappointment was overwhelming, but I tried to console myself with the thought that at least I had something to eat at home. As I opened the fridge, I saw it. A small container with left-over rice from last night's dinner was sitting there, patiently waiting for me.

I sighed, the contrast between my wishful thinking and reality was indeed harsh. With a heavy heart, I heated up the rice and sat down to eat. I kept dreaming about Italian food, but I had to make do with what I had. I made a promise to myself, one day I would be able to afford that dinner without worrying about my wallet.
C. James leaned back in his chair, gently gesturing toward Mike, who sat across the room, nursing a cup of coffee. ""Let Mike share the incident with you as he is the one who went through it and will be able to give enough details,"" he suggested, his eyes flickering with empathy towards his friend. 

Everyone's attention turned to Mike, who was staring blankly into his cup. He looked up, surprised at first but then realizing he had a captive audience. A mild hush fell over the room, the air filled with anticipation and curiosity. 

Drawing a long breath, he began recounting the events of that fateful day. ""I still remember, it was a crisp autumn morning,"" he began, setting the mood, his words echoing in the silent room. His voice quivered slightly as he shared the horrifying experience he had with a home intruder the previous week. 

He described the paralyzing fear, the life-threatening confrontation and the relief when the police finally arrived. The room remained silent as the details unfolded, everyone listening attentively, taking in the raw and honest account of his ordeal. His story filled the room with a palpable tension, the listeners sympathetically sharing his fear, his struggle, and ultimately, his relief.
D. Jeremy was a man of few words, especially when it came to expressing his emotions. Even though he had developed feelings for his coworker, Anna, he was unable to convey them to her verbally. He kept his feelings hidden deep within himself, yet, they couldn't be concealed completely.

Every time he met her, his actions reflected his internal emotions. He was caring towards her, in ways he wasn't with anyone else. He would bring her coffee when she looked tired, offer to help with her workload, and always showed concern about her wellbeing. 

Anna found his actions perplexing but never thought much about it. She considered him a good friend and appreciated his kindness. Despite Jeremy’s silent battle, he continued his routine, unsure of the impact of his actions. And with every passing day, his feelings for her grew stronger, yet, he still kept them locked away, veiled by his caring demeanor.",A,"**ly

272,Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.,"As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.","A. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.
B. For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.
C. John was always an adventurous soul, constantly in search of new thrills. This time, he had decided to conquer the steep, rocky terrain of the Rocky Mountains. It was a bright sunny day and the conditions seemed perfect for his climbing expedition.

He had almost reached the top when his foot slipped on a loose piece of rock. Just at the edge of the cliff, he found himself teetering precariously, his heart pounding against his chest. Panic threatened to seize him as he felt the rocky ground crumble beneath his grip. 

But in an act of quick thinking, he managed to hold on to a sturdy rock protruding from the edge. His fingers ached from the pressure as he struggled to pull himself up. Just as his strength was about to give out, a strong hand reached out, clutching him securely. It was his friend, Mike, who had reached the top first and was now saving John in the nick of time. It was a close call, a brush with death, but John was saved, left with an adrenaline rush and a newfound respect for the mountains.
D. Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.",A,s.
273,A large suburban community has developed outside the city center over the past few decades.,"Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.","A. Once upon a time, in a peaceful little valley, a thick forest grew near the meandering river. This was no ordinary forest; it was an enchanting mix of towering pines, emerald oaks, and myriad colorful wildflowers that danced in the wind. The river, a sparkling ribbon of blue, wound its way lazily through the forest, nourishing it with its life-giving water. Each morning, a shimmering mist would rise from the river and blanket the forest in a gentle, silvery haze.

Wildlife thrived in the forest, making the environment even more vibrant. Deer moved elegantly amongst the trees while the birds filled the air with their melodious songs. As night fell, the nocturnal creatures took over, filling the forest with their whispered conversations and soft scurrying. 

Just beyond the river, a small, picturesque village lay, inhabited by people who revered the forest and considered it a sacred entity. The villagers would often come to the river's edge to collect water, fish or simply marvel at the forest's tranquil beauty. Thus, life existed harmoniously in the quaint valley where the magical forest grew near the river.
B. Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.
C. In the heart of a bustling diner, David, the incharge, was managing the chaos of the rush hour. David was a stern man, a stickler for cleanliness who loved order in his diner. Lately, he had been grappling with the recurring issue of a slippery floor. 

Just a week ago, a new hire, a young man named Jake, had joined their small team. Jake, like a breath of fresh air, brought a refreshing dedication to the monotonous tasks. He took David’s concerns about the slippery floor seriously and promised to remedy it. 

Today, as David walked around inspecting the diner, he couldn't help but notice the sparkly clean floor. His shoes made no squeaking noise, and he felt no slip under his soles. The stern lines on David's face dissolved into a broad smile, filling him with overjoying pride for his new hire. The floor had finally been cleaned properly and was no longer a potential hazard to anyone.
D. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.",A,
274,Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet.,"We moved gingerly through the open field under the caress of the mid-summer sun. The park, normally a lush green carpet, had turned into a dry, bristling field. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet. Every step we took, it felt as though we were walking over a bed of stiff needles. 

The painful pricking only intensified our resolve to reach the patch of lilies at the far end of the field. We had always marvelled at their vibrancy from afar, but had never approached them before. Today was different. Our determination to experience their beauty close up was stronger than our fear of the prickling grass beneath our feet.

Finally, when we reached our destination, we were rewarded with a breathtaking view of the flowerbed. The sight was a testament that not all beauty comes without pain, making the journey through the stinging blades of grass worth every step.","A. Desperate to get to work on time, I resorted to asking Joe for help. It was an unusual request - to borrow his bicycle - but my car was in the shop and the buses were running late. With an amused glint in his eyes, Joe agreed to my plea. ""I got just the thing,"" he said, disappearing into the cluttered confines of his garage.

After a few moments of suspense, the clattering sound of metal against concrete echoed from within. He emerged, rolling out a bicycle that looked like it was on the brink of retirement. Its age was visible in every rusty speck, the faded blue paint was chipping, and the tires were balding, yet it still stood as a symbol of a bygone era. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was left with no other option. 

Gathering my resolve, I thanked Joe and wheeled the old bicycle down the road. The journey ahead would be challenging, yet somewhere within me, I was excited about my adventure on this ancient two-wheeler.
B. Once upon a time, there was a woman named Sara who worked tirelessly in a corporate cubicle day in and day out. She had been in the same position for a decade and the monotonous routine of her job had begun to wear her down. Each day was an exact replica of the previous one with the same old meetings, deadlines, and reports. She felt bored and tired, slowly losing her enthusiasm and zest.

One gloomy Monday, she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen, her heart filling with despair. It was then that she decided she couldn't do it anymore. Sara decided to break free from the chains of her dull job and pursue her passion for cooking. She saved her money and quit her job, leaving the corporate world behind.

She pooled all her resources and took a leap of faith to open up her own restaurant. With love, she chose every detail, from the menu to the decor. Finally, in her own bustling restaurant, she found her happiness and sense of fulfillment she had been longing for.
C. Vanessa had initially planned to cook her famous rosemary chicken for the birthday party. It was a recipe that had been passed down through generations in her family. Whenever she cooked it, the succulent taste of the chicken would leave everyone licking their fingers and asking for more.

However, when she went shopping for ingredients, she found that the supermarket was out of fresh chicken. It was a dilemma, indeed. She pondered over it, deciding what she could cook instead that would be just as impressive and satisfy all the birthday guests. 

After a moment of contemplation, she decided to prepare her grandmother's traditional Italian pasta recipe. As she got home, she swiftly began to cook, her kitchen soon filling up with the savory aromas of garlic and oregano.

As it turned out, the pasta was the star of the party. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made. Her unexpected dish not only won over the guests but also made for a memorable party everyone talked about for weeks.
D. Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.",D,"s Newmarket for the best2 best2ctions.

275,Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.,"Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.","A. Lisa loved her books like they were her own children. She had a dedicated room filled with shelves stacked with every kind of book imaginable. From classic literature to edgy, contemporary novels, her library was her personal sanctuary.

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation. This incident made Lisa realize that she had to set boundaries for her library, even with her closest friends.
B. Sophie had always taken pride in her own ideas, often revelging in the praise her original thinking received. She was known for her imagination, her perspectives that wove a different narrative, an unusual point of view. However, one day, she stumbled upon a series of novels that came highly recommended from her mentor. With anticipation, she turned the first page of the book, unaware of how significantly her mindset was about to shift. 

Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book, each page containing a point of view or analysis that clashed with her previous understanding. The characters and the settings were not the only elements that intrigued her, the ideologies and the morals it portrayed made her question her own beliefs. It wasn't a gentle nudge to her psyche but rather a startling shove, compelling her to step back and reconsider what she thought she knew. 

She wrestled with these new notions, her mind constantly consumed by the storm of thoughts. Gradually, as she engaged more with these texts, she realized the importance of constantly challenging one's beliefs. The books opened her up to a realm of understanding and acceptance, and Sophie learned that no idea is absolute, every thought and belief is meant to be questioned and understood deeply.
C. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.
D. Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.",B,"s M.

276,He attacked every point in my argument.,"During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.","A. Annie was always more of a visual learner. When it came to finding her way around, she preferred the bigger picture a map offered over the specific detail of written directions. She was excited to attend a new music festival in the town nearby, but was not familiar with the location. The festival organizers had sent out an email with written instructions on how to arrive at the event. But Annie couldn't quite follow the sequence of turns and intersections mentioned in the email. 

Deciding to stick to her comfort zone, she picked up a map of the town and started charting out her journey. With the help of her trusted map, she could clearly see the main roads, landmarks, and the distance between each turn. She marked her route in red and made a note of significant markers along the way. Using the map instead of the confusing instructions made her feel more confident and prepared for her journey to the festival. In the end, she reached the event smoothly, proving once again that it is better to use a map with directions than reading the instructions on how to arrive at an event.
B. It was a peaceful Sunday afternoon when Tom decided to undertake a home improvement project. He had been contemplating for a while about hanging a vintage painting he'd bought from a local garage sale. It was a fascinating piece of art, adding a warm charm to the simple ambiance of his living room. So, he decided it was time to showcase it on the main wall. 

He rummaged through his toolbox, retrieved a heavy-duty hammer and a strong, shiny nail. Holding the nail against the wall, he carefully positioned it to ensure the painting would hang perfectly. Raising the hammer, he skillfully swung it back and forth, steadily driving the nail deeper into the wall. Each strike resonated in the quiet room, announcing the start of the transformation process. 

He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer until it was perfectly placed, ready to hold the weight of the antique frame. Finally, satisfied with his efforts, he gently hung the painting, turning his living room wall into an exhibition of elegance and class.
C. Upon the release of the school's basketball team list, Tim was devastated to find his name absent from the roster. His hopes had been high, his dreams of playing as a power forward crashing down as reality set in - he hadn't made the cut. As he stood there in front of the gym, the basketball in his hand felt like a weight. His friends, other aspiring athletes, tried to console him, but their words were like hollow echoes in his disappointed mind. 

Barry, an older and wise friend who had graduated two years prior, happened to be visiting the school that day. He noticed Tim's gloomy expression and inquired about his sorrow. After hearing Tim's story, he shared his sympathetic understanding. However, Barry also offered him words of encouragement and wisdom. He advised Tim to stray away from his emotions, to not let this setback define him but instead to use it as motivation to work harder. Barry instilled hope in Tim, reminding him that there was always next year's tryout and an opportunity to come back stronger than ever.
D. Having spent an entire day immersed in a painting marathon, my friend Laura was now completely drained. She was sprawled out on her art studio's hardwood floor, an array of oil colors, paint brushes, and half-finished canvases scattered around her. Her body was worn out but her eyes sparkled with satisfaction. She had challenged herself to complete ten paintings in one day and she had achieved her goal. 

Laura is a dedicated artist, consumed by her work and often forgetting to take a break. Today was no different. She had started her marathon early in the morning. The sun had barely risen when she set up her easel and palette. Now, as the last rays of the setting sun seeped through the studio window, she lay exhausted on the floor.

Despite my insistence, she refused to get up for several minutes. The artistic satisfaction coursing through her veins seemed to outweigh the physical fatigue. I admired her dedication, as Laura proved yet again, that for her, art wasn't just a hobby but a way of life.",B,"s.

277,The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower.,"A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.","A. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.
B. Chef Marco, an experienced professional with a taste for adventure, scanned his kitchen bustling with activity. He was used to a clientele that was more daring in their culinary tastes, always willing to try something new and exciting. Today, however, he found himself serving a less adventurous customer, someone who had no particular desire to explore the exotic and unusual dishes that were Chef Marco's specialty. He had no wish to force his culinary philosophy on anyone who was not willing to accept it.

With a sigh, Chef Marco took a step back, consulting his list of simpler recipes reserved for such instances. His eyes quickly scanned over the list, finally settling on the perfect dish - a classic beef stew with roasted vegetables, a comforting dish that was sure to satisfy. His hands started to move with an assured fluidity, expertly cutting the beef and vegetables into equal sizes, then browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables. 

He simmered everything in a robust broth, letting the aroma fill his kitchen. He knew this dish was a world away from his typical experimental recipes, but he also knew that sometimes, simplicity has its own charm. As he served the customer, he did so with the same level of pride, knowing that even with less adventurous dishes, his skills as a chef could still shine.
C. She had been working tirelessly on a high-profile project for her company. Every day for weeks, she would wake up before sunrise and go to sleep way past midnight. Her mind constantly buzzed with deadlines, strategies, and implementations. While she loved her work, the intensity of this project started to take a toll on her mental and physical well-being.

Her face became gaunt, dark circles took permanent residency under her eyes, and her once jovem spirit started to feel weary. She could see her performance declining, mistakes slipping in her work that she would have never made before. The realization hit her hard; she was severely exhausted.

Something had to change. Thus, she decided to take a break and prioritize her health. She requested a month off work, packed her favorite books and clothes, and flew to a tropical island for a well-deserved vacation to rejuvenate herself.
D. Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.",A,"s x D story story S story PEN childrenME other new .

278,A succession of waves battered the rock.,"A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.","A. Dr. Smith, the chemistry professor at Northwood University, sat quietly in his office preparing to deliver some unfortunate news. He had been grading papers all morning when he'd noticed a peculiar mistake in his register. One of his top students, Anna, had been marked as having scored an A in Chemistry. Dr. Smith remembered her hard work and dedication, but he also remembered that her final score wasn't that high.

One afternoon, Dr. Smith had Anna stop by his office after class. With a hesitant voice, he said, ""I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error."" Anna's eyes widened, and her heart dropped. She had worked tirelessly all semester, and she thought her efforts had finally paid off. 

Dr. Smith saw the disappointment in Anna's eyes and immediately regretted having to be the one to tell her. He wished there had been another way to handle the situation, but honesty was a principle he believed in strongly. Despite the error in the final grade, Anna's determination and commitment were unaffected, promising not only to excel in chemistry but also in all other academic endeavours.
B. Nina was not in the mood for distractions today, as she slipped on her headphones at her desk. Over the past two weeks, her days had been consumed by endless, often unnecessary, phone calls from clients. Today was different though. ""Please don't bother me today with any calls,"" she whispered to her officemate, Sarah, a mild pleading in her eyes. 

She wasn't in the mood for the regular squabbles over minor contract errors or small budget adjustments. Today, she had bigger fish to fry. Today was the day she planned to tackle the company's largest client, who had been expressing concerns over recent services provided. This was no ordinary phone call; it was a rescue mission. It was about saving a business relationship that the company had spent years building and nurturing. 

If she succeeded in solving the client's issues, she could potentially save the company. Thus, for Nina, this was not just any ordinary day at the office, but a day that could make or break her career.
C. Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.
D. The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage. 

Despite the diversity of their subjects, a sense of camaraderie marked each group. United by shared interests, they were all part of the dynamic world of technology, bridging gaps and paving the way for a shared future.",C,
279,A string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play.,"The highly anticipated opening of the local theater's newest play, ""Murder in the Manor,"" was approaching. Everything had been planned meticulously, from the intricate set designs to the finely tailored costumes. However, a string of unfortunate events had plagued the production of the play, threatening its ultimate success.

First, the star actor, known for his melodramatic portrayal of the villain, fell ill with laryngitis. His unique voice was a trademark of his performances, and without it, the play was off to a rocky start. Next, a critical prop, the ornate dagger for the climactic murder scene, was mysteriously lost. The team had searched everywhere but to no avail. 

As if matters couldn't get worse, a fire broke out in the costume room, causing damage to several important pieces. Then, the heavy, antique chandelier, a vital part of the set, crashed onto the stage during a rehearsal, narrowly missing the stand-ins. Furthermore, incessant rainfall led to a leak in the theatre's roof, flooding the orchestra pit.

Despite these setbacks, the determined cast and crew soldiered on, refusing to let their hard work go to waste. Their resilience in the face of adversity was a testament to their passion for the theater. After all, the show must go on.","A. When people asked him about his guitar skills, he often downplayed his ability. He was humble to a fault, uncomfortable with praise, and often used self-deprecating humor to change the subject. He laughed and brushed off the compliments, saying he was still learning, still trying to get the hang of the instrument.

However, all modesty fell away when he picked up his guitar. As soon as his fingers touched the strings, it was like a transformation had occurred. His fingers moved effortlessly over the strings, each note ringing out clear and true. His rhythm was steady, his melodies enchanting. Even to the untrained ear, it was evident that the music he produced was no fluke.

Every second he spent practicing, every moment of struggle and achievement, was revealed in the soulful tunes that resonated in the room. Though he spoke of his guitar skills poorly, when he played, his hard work reverberated through the music he produced. He was indeed a true musician, letting his work speak louder than his words.
B. During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.
C. John had always been a hard worker. He'd arrive at the office before everyone else and would be the last to leave, ensuring that all his assignments were done promptly and correctly. His dedication was unshakeable, and it didn't go unnoticed. 

Recently, management had held a meeting, discussing the various improvements in company processes. John's name was mentioned frequently, many complimenting his diligence and commitment to his job. The executives were impressed by his accomplishments and his ability to inspire his colleagues. The decision was then made, a vote unanimous in favor of acknowledging John's efforts.

When the announcement came, John was taken aback. His superiors congratulated him, thanking him for his tireless work and positive influence on the team. Having received recognition from the management for his diligence, he got the promotion, a well-deserved reward for his relentless determination and commitment to the company.
D. Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.",B,s.

280,The economic depression was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies.,"The economic depression that began to grip the nation was not a sudden event. In fact, it was the combined result of several risky fiscal policies that had been implemented over a period of years. The government, in a bid to stimulate economic growth, had begun to invest heavily in risky ventures.

Early on, the nation had seen a surge in economic activity. It seemed for a while that the risky policies were actually paying off. Yet, a keen observer would have noticed the unsustainable trajectory of this growth. Many companies, fueled by reckless investments, were expanding at a rate far beyond their means.

However, the bubble burst when these companies began defaulting on their loans. Banks, suddenly faced with massive losses, began to tighten their loan policies. As credit began to dry up, businesses started to fold, leading to layoffs and the economic depression. Therefore, it can be seen that this depression was not a random event, but a consequence of several risky fiscal policies.","A. Larry sat alone in his dark room, still feeling upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. The pain of the separation seemed to linger around him, his room echoing with emptiness and gloom. He had shared unforgettable moments with Samantha, and her sudden exit from his life had left him crippled emotionally.

Mary, his caring sister, was very concerned about Larry's prolonged melancholy. She had observed him wallow in despair for a little too long. One day, she decided to intervene, in hopes to help him move past his pain. She ventured into his room, finding him lost in thought, staring at a picture of Samantha.

""Larry,"" Mary began gently, ""there is no point in dwelling over the breakup any longer."" She paused, letting her words sink in before she proceeded, ""Samantha has moved on, and so should you."" She hoped her words would evoke some realization within her brother.

She left the room, leaving Larry to contemplate her advice. He needed to move on, she was right. He couldn't continue to let his past overshadow his present and future. Samantha was now a part of his history; a history which Larry must use as a stepping stone towards a happier future, and not as a stumbling block.
B. After months of grueling hard work, countless rallies, speeches, and debates, a sense of relief enveloped the politician. He had all but secured the election. The numbers were on his side and the public had warmed up to him. 

He started his campaign as a dark horse. His opponents were well-known figures in politics. They underestimated his power, seeing him as little more than a nuisance. But, his constant perseverance and the distinct integrity he possessed caught the public's attention.

The tide began to turn halfway through the campaign. His popularity soared after a powerful speech about the importance of honesty and transparency in politics. He spoke sincerely, without any hidden agenda, making sure his words reached the heart of the common man. 

His campaign team worked tirelessly to make him a prominent figure in the political landscape. The intense campaigning paid off; it was clear the politician had won over the public. The election night was expected to be a mere formality, marking the beginning of his term in the office. He felt content and hopeful about his future as a leader, grateful that his months of relentless campaigning had not been in vain.
C. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
D. It was a peaceful Sunday afternoon when Tom decided to undertake a home improvement project. He had been contemplating for a while about hanging a vintage painting he'd bought from a local garage sale. It was a fascinating piece of art, adding a warm charm to the simple ambiance of his living room. So, he decided it was time to showcase it on the main wall. 

He rummaged through his toolbox, retrieved a heavy-duty hammer and a strong, shiny nail. Holding the nail against the wall, he carefully positioned it to ensure the painting would hang perfectly. Raising the hammer, he skillfully swung it back and forth, steadily driving the nail deeper into the wall. Each strike resonated in the quiet room, announcing the start of the transformation process. 

He knocked the nail into the wall with a hammer until it was perfectly placed, ready to hold the weight of the antique frame. Finally, satisfied with his efforts, he gently hung the painting, turning his living room wall into an exhibition of elegance and class.",D,#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Robert had always been a casual smoker, he enjoyed the occasional puff with his coffee or after a heavy meal. He never thought about the consequences of it. One day, his best friend, Samuel, warned him, ""Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health."" He mentioned how the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can lead to serious health conditions, including lung cancer. 

Robert brushed off his concerns, claiming that it was a stress-reliever for him. But Samuel was relentless. He introduced him to an ex-smoker, named Jeff, who had narrowly escaped lung cancer. Jeff vividly described his ordeals, the grueling chemotherapy sessions, and the fear of living with cancer. 

This struck a chord with Robert. After some contemplation, he finally made the decision to quit smoking, realizing the threat it posed to his health.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, with her constantly changing hair color and an inexplicable love for oversized, flashy accessories, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met. Her quirky appearance always manages to take people by surprise when she voices her thoughts. We first crossed paths at a local café, where Lexi was wearing a sunflower crown and sporting a bright blue hair. I remember overhearing her conversation with the elderly man at the next table, about the geopolitical ramifications of a recent election.

Even though her flashy appearance said otherwise, her intellect and insight were evident in her every word. Lexi's wisdom extends beyond politics. She can, in one moment, discuss the finer points of classical literature, then easily switch to explaining the complexities of quantum physics or debating the abstract philosophies of life. 

Being around her, I began to understand the depth of her knowledge and the breadth of her understanding. It was a lesson to not judge someone by their appearance, because here was Lexi, vibrant and quirky, yet full of wisdom that could put the wisest of scholars to shame. Despite her exterior portraying her as an airhead, Lexi has, and continues to be, a paragon of wisdom and intellect to me.
C. Vanessa had initially planned to cook her famous rosemary chicken for the birthday party. It was a recipe that had been passed down through generations in her family. Whenever she cooked it, the succulent taste of the chicken would leave everyone licking their fingers and asking for more.

However, when she went shopping for ingredients, she found that the supermarket was out of fresh chicken. It was a dilemma, indeed. She pondered over it, deciding what she could cook instead that would be just as impressive and satisfy all the birthday guests. 

After a moment of contemplation, she decided to prepare her grandmother's traditional Italian pasta recipe. As she got home, she swiftly began to cook, her kitchen soon filling up with the savory aromas of garlic and oregano.

As it turned out, the pasta was the star of the party. Had she brought the chicken for the birthday party as planned, we wouldn't have got the chance to taste the delicious pasta she made. Her unexpected dish not only won over the guests but also made for a memorable party everyone talked about for weeks.
D. Harry was a dedicated young athlete with a dream; a dream to win the prestigious city marathon. All his life, he had been waiting for this moment, the moment when he could finally prove his worth to himself and to the world around him. He knew that if he wanted to win, he couldn't leave any stone unturned. He would have to prepare tirelessly for the final race, putting each and every ounce of energy he had into the training.

Every morning, before the sun dared to peep over the horizon, Harry would lace up his running shoes and head for the trails. He took on steep hills, rough terrains and practiced in every weather condition - rain, sunshine, and snow alike. Every drop of sweat that gushed down his face represented his dedication and hard work, only fueling his determination further. He balanced this strenuous training with a well-disciplined diet and sleep schedule.

On rest days, he visualized himself crossing the finish line first, basking in the glory of his hard work. But it wasn't just about winning anymore; the journey had taught him more about perseverance, patience, and his love for the sport.

His adrenaline-pumping adventures ranged from skydiving to deep-sea diving. Yet, the most thrilling adventure for him was the stock market. The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket.""

C. After a seemingly endless week of turbulent storms, the weather finally became pleasant. The gray, heavy clouds that had been hanging low in the sky like an oppressive blanket were replaced with a soft, clean blue expanse. For days, the town had been relentlessly pounded by rain, lightning tearing through the skies with a fury that sent shivers down one's spine. The wind had shrieked, howling like a banshee as it tore through the deserted streets, ripping leaves from the trees.

The townspeople had huddled inside their homes, watching nervously as the rain pelted against the windows, hoping the storm would soon pass. Children had been kept indoors, their laughter and joy missed in the quiet town. It was a week that many thought would never end, yet it did. Finally, the storm retreated, leaving behind a calmness that was almost surreal.

Sunlight poured down from the cloudless sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the town. The streets were filled with laughter and joy once more, as children dashed outside, thrilled to be free of the gloominess. The weather had finally become pleasant following the stormy week, leaving a sense of peace and relief that hung heavy in the air.
D. Sally had always been aware of her circumstances with Scott. In fact, she had thought through it again and again, turning it over in her mind like a coin inspecting all of its facets. She knew perfectly well that their situation was a complicated one; rife with obstacles that most would find insurmountable. Scott was married, he had children, he was also her boss.

Despite these reasons, there was an inexplicable connection that drew her towards him. Their mutual feelings for each other were undeniable, and while they made their relationship more complicated, they also made it more valuable. She saw the way he looked at her, the subtle signs of love and affection that were there for anyone observant enough to notice.

She was known for her imagination, her perspectives that wove a different narrative, an unusual point of view. However, one day, she stumbled upon a series of novels that came highly recommended from her mentor. With anticipation, she turned the first page of the book, unaware of how significantly her mindset was about to shift. 

Her ideas were challenged as she read book after book, each page containing a point of view or analysis that clashed with her previous understanding. The characters and the settings were not the only elements that intrigued her, the ideologies and the morals it portrayed made her question her own beliefs. It wasn't a gentle nudge to her psyche but rather a startling shove, compelling her to step back and reconsider what she thought she knew. 

She wrestled with these new notions, her mind constantly consumed by the storm of thoughts. Gradually, as she engaged more with these texts, she realized the importance of constantly challenging one's beliefs. The books opened her up to a realm of understanding and acceptance, and Sophie learned that no idea is absolute, every thought and belief is meant to be questioned and understood deeply.","A. A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.
B. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.
C. When I first started the training program, I was brimming with confidence. I was certain that I would breeze through it in the estimated one year. Unfortunately, life had other plans, and I faced unexpected challenges that made it impossible for me to complete it within the suggested timeframe. My mother's sudden illness required me to return home and take over the family business.

I remember thinking that I had failed, that I wouldn't get the chance to complete my training. Yet, I didn't let that deter me completely. I continued the program while juggling responsibilities at home. It took me twice as long as most of my peers, extending my training into three years instead of the projected one. There were times I wanted to give up, but I held on, fueled by sheer determination. The journey took longer than expected, but at least I have the credential now, proving that endurance and resilience can overcome the toughest of circumstances.
D. Samantha had always been a frugal young woman. The amount she had in her savings account was the result of years of careful spending and diligent saving. It was a security blanket, a nest egg for future endeavors, and possibly emergencies. And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue. She figured it was better to wait a few months when the rush of holiday travelers would die down, and prices would drop. By then, she would still have a substantial amount left in her savings after purchasing a ticket, and could even have extra money for her trip. In this way, Samantha was ensuring that she would not only have a memorable trip but also a financially secure future.",A,s and the 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2038 2039 20 be 20 be 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 200 200 200 20 200 20 200 200 200 000 200 200
284,It's hard to love with a broken heart.,"It's hard to love with a broken heart. Mary knew this all too well as she looked at her own reflection in the mirror. The lines of sadness etched in her face, her eyes dull and lifeless. It was as though her very soul had been shattered into pieces. She had once been vibrant and full of life, but now she was just a husk of her former self.

Her heart, once whole and filled with love, had been broken by the man she loved more than anything in the world. Betrayal had taken its toll, transforming her from a carefree woman in love to a broken shell, mistrustful and afraid to love again. She turned away from the mirror, her heart aching at the sight of her broken self. 

Every day was a struggle to get out of bed, to face the world with a false smile while her heart was bleeding. It was hard to love with a broken heart, indeed, but Mary knew that she needed to find a way to heal, to love again, for her own sanity and happiness.","A. John and I had always been obsessed with mysteries and true crime stories. When we heard about the recent robbery in our quiet neighborhood, we knew we needed to investigate. ""Let's meet him and ask about the robbery,"" I suggested to John. ""Since he is the one who was robbed, it would be much more thrilling to hear from him directly.""

John agreed and we both took the short walk to Mr. Thompson's house, a semi-detached property that had seen better days. Knocking on the door, we were greeted by a man in his sixties, seemingly calm despite his ordeal. He invited us in, offering us a weak smile as he served us cups of lukewarm tea.

We sat in his surprisingly orderly living room, full of anticipation. He began sharing his experience, his voice trembling as he remembered the incident. Each detail was more thrilling than the next - from how he discovered his missing possessions, to his first glimpse of the security footage revealing the burglar's masked face. Though we felt empathy for Mr. Thompson's loss, we couldn't hide our excitement at living a real life mystery. It was indeed much more thrilling hearing it from the victim himself.
B. Lisa loved her books like they were her own children. She had a dedicated room filled with shelves stacked with every kind of book imaginable. From classic literature to edgy, contemporary novels, her library was her personal sanctuary.

Her neighbour, Mark, often borrowed her books, usually asking her first. They had bonded over their shared love of literature, and she was always more than willing to share her treasures with him. But last week, Mark had taken one of her most prized possessions, an antique first-edition book, without her permission.

Lisa had immediately noticed the absence of her precious novel from the spot she always kept it. It was just the kind of book that Mark loved, so she instinctively knew he was the culprit. However, instead of confronting him, she decided to let it slide.

She hoped that he would soon realize his mistake, and return her book without the need for an awkward confrontation. This incident made Lisa realize that she had to set boundaries for her library, even with her closest friends.
C. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
D. After a long day at work, Sam staggered out of his office towards the parking lot. He unlocked his car, throwing his briefcase onto the backseat before sinking into the driver's seat. However, when he inserted his keys and turned on the ignition, all he heard was a sputtering noise. He tried again, but the car refused to come to life, only giving out faint, distressed sounds.

With a sinking feeling, he glanced at the fuel gauge. It was on empty. A frustrated groan escaped his lips as he remembered passing the gas station earlier, opting not to stop, thinking he had enough fuel to last the trip home. He now realized how wrong he was. ""I guess I've learned the hard way,"" he muttered, reaching for his phone to call a tow truck. ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""",D,s and the 20s and the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"Tom's morning started in a terrible fashion; the clumsy knock of his elbow had sent his favorite mug, filled with fresh brewed coffee, plummeting to the floor. He watched, in a frozen moment of horror, as the ceramic cup shattered into fragments, splattering the dark liquid in all directions. A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee, and his tiled kitchen floor served as a bitter testament to that fact.

Staring blankly at the mess, he sighed, a combination of frustration and aching tiredness. His bare feet inched around the shards and coffee pools as he walked slowly to the sink, pulling out a mop from under it. This wasn't the first time he had broken a cup, and probably wouldn't be the last, but this time it felt different.

The cup had been a cherished gift from his grandmother, a memento from his childhood. His fingers traced the edge of a ceramic piece, a sentimental reminder of sweet, simpler times. As he began to mop the floor, he decided he would pick up the broken pieces and try to restore it.

After all, even a broken cup can sometimes be mended, he thought, and with a semblance of a smile, he began his quest to make the best out of the worst start to his morning.","A. I'm a firm believer in the importance of a good work-life balance. However, this principle was severely challenged last week when I found myself in a uniquely stressful situation. Unusually, I had five crucial project deadlines staring me right in the face. Each one was equally important to my team and could not afford to be overlooked or delayed.

As a result, last week was unlike any other. Instead of my typical eight-hour work days, I found myself putting in twelve to fourteen hours instead. My desk became my dining table as meals were hastily consumed between conference calls and piles of paperwork.

At nights, sleep became a luxury, something I could only afford after all urgent tasks had been dealt with. Needless to say, leisure and relaxation were completely out of the question. But despite the exhaustion, I managed to meet each and every deadline, proving to myself that sometimes, bending the rules of work-life balance is necessary for success.
B. Sachin Tendulkar, an Indian cricketer, was widely recognized as the best cricketer in the world. His ability to manipulate the cricket ball with his bat, his speed between the wickets, and his defensive techniques have astonished spectators and opponents alike. From the pitches of Mumbai to the renowned cricketing grounds of Lords in England, Sachin's performances had built him a reputation unparalleled in modern cricketing history. 

Every cricket enthusiast, whether from India or not, admired Sachin's artistry and skill. Cricket connoisseurs often say that watching Sachin on the field was like watching poetry in motion. Sachin was not just a player; he was an emotion that united a billion people in India, making them forget their worries and differences every time he walked onto the pitch.

However, like every other player, Sachin also had to face the inevitable twilight of his career. Despite holding numerous records and accolades under his belt, time spares no one. The day of his retirement from cricket was considered a dark day for the sport. Nevertheless, the legend of Sachin still lives on in the hearts of millions, proving that while players retire, their legacy remains forever.
C. John, the dedicated host of the evening, was a vision of efficiency as he brought out one exquisite dish after another onto the large dining room table. His actions were measured, each movement practiced and precise. The tantalizing aroma of the roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and fresh cranberry sauce wafted through the air, filling the house with the inviting scent of the holiday season.

As the final dish - a delectable apple pie - was set down, he wiped his hands on the apron draped around his waist and turned to survey his handiwork. The ornately decorated table was groaning under the weight of the holiday feast, each dish reflecting his prowess and passion for cooking.

At the sound of cutlery clattering against porcelain, he looked up to find his guests beginning to congregate around the table. Their faces were lit with anticipation and their mouths watered at the sight of the magnificent spread. The delighted ""Oohs"" and ""Ahhs"" of his guests were music to his ears, their expressions of wonder and awe the validation he'd been craving.

With a smile, he bid his guests to sit and help themselves to the feast. Laughter echoed through the room as everyone took their seats, a harmonious scene of gratitude and togetherness. John couldn't help but feel content, for he knew that his elaborate feast had succeeded in bringing joy and unity to his friends and family.
D. Once upon a time, a man named Henry lived in a tiny, worn-out house. He was a man of humble means and owned very little. Among his scant possessions was a single china plate that he used for all his meals. One afternoon, as he was cleaning his plate, it slipped from his hands and shattered into a dozen pieces. Henry stared at the fragments in disbelief. 

""No,"" he murmured to himself. ""One can't eat from a broken plate."" His mind raced as he tried to come up with a solution. With a sigh, he realized he would have to save up to buy a new one. Until then, he would eat directly from the pot, reminding himself that even in adversity, life goes on.",D,#1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
286,You can't pour from an empty cup.,"Lily was the kind of person who was always running around trying to help others. She had an exceptional kind heart, always lending a hand, lending an ear, and giving out pieces of her heart to those in need. Her friends, family, and even sometimes strangers benefited from her tireless dedication to making people's lives better. However, Lily often neglected her own needs. 

One day, her close friend, Maria, noticed the tiredness in Lily's eyes. She was a shadow of her bubbly self, a clear indication she was drained. Maria gently reminded her, ""Lily, you can't pour from an empty cup."" 

Lily looked puzzled, so Maria explained, ""You give so much of yourself, but you can't forget to replenish your own energy."" Maria reminded Lily about the importance of self-care, of setting boundaries and ensuring her own cup was filled before she attempted to fill others. It was a lesson Lily took to heart, finally understanding that she couldn't effectively help others if she herself was running on empty.","A. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.
B. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.
C. Sally was an independent woman, living in a bustling city when she received the news that changed her life forever. Her younger brother, Mike, whom she adored dearly, had been in a fatal car accident. His sudden demise shook Sally's entire world and the void he left behind seemed impossible to fill. Despite the overwhelming grief, she realized that her aged parents were in much worse shape. 

Their world revolved around their two children, and now, they had lost one of them. Sally knew that she had to step up and comfort them despite grappling with her own pain. She had to gather the strength to be the pillar of support for her parents when her only sibling passed away. With determination in her heart and tears in her eyes, she traveled back to her hometown to be by their side. 

Over time, Sally took over the responsibility of comforting her parents and helping them find hope in their darkest hour. Although the pain of their loss never truly diminished, Sally's resilience and emotional support eventually brought them a sense of peace. Her unwavering strength became the light guiding her parents through their darkest times.

287,A fallen tree cannot provide shade.,"Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest adorned with lush green trees, there stood a magnificent oak tree, the oldest and tallest among them. Its grandeur and magnificent aura provided shade and shelter to countless creatures. One fateful night, a storm ravaged the forest, severely damaging many of the trees. The relentless winds managed to fell the grand oak tree, it's mighty fall echoed throughout the forest. 

Come the morning, the woodland inhabitants were in for a shock. The vast expanse that once thrived under the shade of the grand oak was now exposed to the scorching sun. A fallen tree, it was realized, cannot provide shade, a sentiment that echoed through every creature's heart. The squirrels, the birds, the insects, all missed the comforting shade they once called home. 

This realization marked a turning point in the lives of the forest dwellers. Despite the loss of their beloved tree, they understood the power of change, even if it was painful. And in the grand oak's memory, they grew stronger, embracing the sunlight with resilience, and learned to adapt to their new environment.","A. The A team was known throughout the league as the undeniable powerhouse, the top dog. It boasted of players who could dribble with finesse, shoot with pinpoint accuracy, and defend with relentless intensity. The swift and deadly forwards were matched by the relentless backfield, each player a vital piece in a well-oiled machine. There was Johnny, the swift point guard, and Billy, the towering center, both indispensable members of the team. With them leading the way, their opponents were often left awestruck.

However, there was one player who stood out for all the wrong reasons. His name was Ron. Despite possessing the physical attributes of a great player, Ron had a knack for making poor decisions at crucial moments in the game. He would frequently lose focus, his mind drifting off during team strategies, and he seemed utterly oblivious to the damage he was causing.

His lack of discipline and teamwork often undermined the combined efforts of the team, leading to crucial losses. The other players were growing frustrated with his irresponsible attitude. The A team, despite having the best players, found their glory tarnished by the one player who refused to be a team player.

C. ""I cannot believe you don't know who Cristiano Ronaldo is!"" I exclaimed, incredulous that my American cousin, Ben, didn't recognize such a prominent name. Ben, having been raised on American football, had only a passing acquaintance with the world of soccer. 

""He is one of the greatest football players alive,"" I told him, trying to impress upon him the importance of Ronaldo. Ben shrugged, appearing only mildly interested. ""Football, as in soccer?"" he asked, and I nodded, astonished at his lack of knowledge.

""Let me paint a picture for you,"" I started, desperately trying to bridge the cultural gap between us. ""Ronaldo is to football what Michael Jordan is to basketball. He's a phenomenon, a once-in-a-generation player, who has taken the sport to new levels with his skill, athleticism, and sheer determination.""

""His speed, his agility, his ability to control the ball as if it was an extension of his own body, is unmatched,"" I continued. ""And that’s why he is considered a legend."" After hearing all this, Ben seemed to grasp the significance of Ronaldo a little bit more. He promised to check out some of Ronaldo's matches on the internet, signaling the small victory of international sports exchange.
D. John had been working as a software engineer for nearly a decade and developed a knack for understanding and fixing technical glitches. Because of his expertise, friends often approached him with their tech problems. One day, his friend, Lisa, approached him with a desperate expression on her face. Her laptop, which contained all her work and personal data, was refusing to boot up.

""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" John told her regretfully, ""it would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" He explained that the problem was a corrupt operating system. If it had been caught early on, he could have potentially restored the system or saved her data. However, the damage was now too extensive, and the system irreparable.

288,No light can be found from an unlit candle.,"On a snowy night, in a tiny town on the edge of the world, there was a house so old, every nook and corner echoed stories of time. This house was lit only by the glow of a hundred candles; an extraordinary sight to see from the outside, creating a sparkling mirage against the backdrop of the cold white surroundings. 

However, one day a strong breeze blew through the house, extinguishing all the candles and leaving it in complete darkness. The owners of the house, an elderly couple, did not have any extra candles. ""No light can be found from an unlit candle,"" the old man muttered, feeling around in the darkness. His wife echoed his thoughts, sighing in dismay. 

Despair started to seep in when they thought of the long, cold night that awaited them. However, the old lady remembered a tiny, forgotten candle she had saved for years, tucked away in a corner. With a striking match, the last candle was lit, casting a warm glow in the room. The house had lost its grandeur for the night, but the couple was content, comforted by the small but enduring glow of their solitary candle.","A.

B. Ever since I can remember, I've yearned for a place to call my own. The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize. 

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

However, I've come to terms with my situation, understanding that this is just a stepping stone towards achieving my dream. I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate.
C. Kate had always been a hardworking and dedicated employee, until one day, she was unjustly fired from her job. The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively. She started looking for a new job, determined to move on from the past and prove her worth elsewhere.
D. Danielle, deeply saddened by the recent demise of her beloved grandfather, had cried the entire night. Tears flowed like a river as memories of the warm, loving man who raised her flooded in, sorrow engulfing her like a dark cloud. The gentle whisper of his wisdom in her ears felt painfully sweet, leaving a longing ache in her heart. She held his old, worn-out scarf close to her heart, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne, in a desperate attempt to keep her emotions at bay. 

However, with the first glimpse of the sunrise, she made a powerful resolution. She decided to not let her sorrow affect those around her, to not let it shadow the start of their new day. And so, summoning all her strength and inner resilience, she wiped her tears and put on a brave smile. She greeted everyone in the morning like sunshine, spreading warmth and positivity. Her eyes, although misty with unshed tears, shone with an undeniable spark of hope. Danielle, in her own poignant way, had decided to keep her grandfather's legacy of joy and love alive, even in the face of her own heartbreak.",A,"B.

The vision of a small cottage nestled in the countryside, with a tranquil garden where I could read, relax, or simply be at peace, often came to my mind. I yearned for the independence and privacy that came along with having my own house. Unfortunately, my financial circumstances have not allowed this dream to materialize.

It wasn't by choice that I ended up living in a small apartment, sharing it with two other people. The rent was all I could afford at the time and beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. My roommates are decent enough, but it's not the same as having a space to call your own. Noise, mess, and lack of privacy often disrupt my peace.

However, I've come to terms with my situation, understanding that this is just a stepping stone towards achieving my dream. I still hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be able to afford a house of my own, instead of being a mere renter and a flatmate."

It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal.

During the university debate competition, I was up against John, known for his exceptional debating skills. Every opponent he ever faced had an unfortunate fate and today it was my turn. As the judges announced the topic, my confidence heightened. Little did I know what was about to come.

I presented my argument with the utmost passion and detail, trying to cover every possible aspect. However, as I concluded, I looked at John, his face smug and his eyes brimming with confidence. As he rose to speak, I could sense a sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. He opened his mouth and eloquently began to critique my argument.

With an almost brutal precision, he attacked every point in my argument. From the examples I quoted to the theories I cited, nothing remained unscathed. His words flowed smoothly as he questioned my logic, interpretation, and even my facts. Despite being on the receiving end, I was in awe of his skills. 

The room filled with a deathly silence once he concluded. As I stood there, trying to fathom what had just happened, I realized he had torn apart my argument piece by piece. There was nothing left for me to salvage; my argument lay in ruins. However, there was a newfound respect for John in my heart. I may have lost the debate that day, but I had gained a priceless lesson in the art of argument.
B. It's hard to love with a broken heart. Mary knew this all too well as she looked at her own reflection in the mirror. The lines of sadness etched in her face, her eyes dull and lifeless. It was as though her very soul had been shattered into pieces. She had once been vibrant and full of life, but now she was just a husk of her former self.

Her heart, once whole and filled with love, had been broken by the man she loved more than anything in the world. Betrayal had taken its toll, transforming her from a carefree woman in love to a broken shell, mistrustful and afraid to love again. She turned away from the mirror, her heart aching at the sight of her broken self. 

Every day was a struggle to get out of bed, to face the world with a false smile while her heart was bleeding. It was hard to love with a broken heart, indeed, but Mary knew that she needed to find a way to heal, to love again, for her own sanity and happiness.
C. We moved gingerly through the open field under the caress of the mid-summer sun. The park, normally a lush green carpet, had turned into a dry, bristling field. Each blade of grass was a bayonet pointed firmly at our bare feet. Every step we took, it felt as though we were walking over a bed of stiff needles. 

The painful pricking only intensified our resolve to reach the patch of lilies at the far end of the field. We had always marvelled at their vibrancy from afar, but had never approached them before. Today was different. Our determination to experience their beauty close up was stronger than our fear of the prickling grass beneath our feet.

Finally, when we reached our destination, we were rewarded with a breathtaking view of the flowerbed. The sight was a testament that not all beauty comes without pain, making the journey through the stinging blades of grass worth every step.
D. Mr. Davis, a seasoned mathematics teacher, had been grappling with the challenging task of explaining the concept of calculus to his class. Over several weeks, he'd attempted various methods, yet felt he hadn't fully reached his students. His frustration was growing, but he refused to give up, knowing the importance of this particular topic.

One day, he stumbled upon an interactive mathematics game online, which presented complex topics in a simplified, engaging manner. With newfound optimism, he decided to incorporate this method into his teaching. The following day, he introduced the game to his students, explaining that it would be their new means of understanding calculus. 

As the days passed, he watched their progress closely, anticipating that he was onto something. Soon, their class participation, homework submissions, and test scores indicated a surge in understanding. It was the day when one of the most quiet students voluntarily solved a complex problem on the board that Mr. Davis knew he had finally succeeded. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students. His sense of accomplishment radiated through the classroom, bringing a new energy that inspired even more learning.",B,"```

290,You can't drive a car with no fuel.,"After a long day at work, Sam staggered out of his office towards the parking lot. He unlocked his car, throwing his briefcase onto the backseat before sinking into the driver's seat. However, when he inserted his keys and turned on the ignition, all he heard was a sputtering noise. He tried again, but the car refused to come to life, only giving out faint, distressed sounds.

With a sinking feeling, he glanced at the fuel gauge. It was on empty. A frustrated groan escaped his lips as he remembered passing the gas station earlier, opting not to stop, thinking he had enough fuel to last the trip home. He now realized how wrong he was. ""I guess I've learned the hard way,"" he muttered, reaching for his phone to call a tow truck. ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""","A. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always had an insatiable curiosity for the world. My parents tried to answer my million questions, but they often found it hard to explain certain concepts to me. Then, they began showing me pictures and drawings, and that was when my understanding grew. I remember distinctly, the drawing that introduced me to the concept of the solar system.

The drawing showed me at one glance, what a book could only show me in many pages. At first glance, I saw colorful planets orbiting a radiant sun, each with their own distinct patterns and sizes. The earth, a blue dot, placed third from the sun made me comprehend our position in the universe. The distinct rings of Saturn, the redness of Mars, the size of Jupiter, all seemed to tell their own story.

Those simple illustrations sparked a fascination in me for the cosmos and it was far more effective than any description in a book. Thus, a picture became my stepping stone to the infinite world of knowledge, proving that sometimes, one glance can offer insight a thousand words may fail to give.
B. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.
C. At seven years old, Tommy was known for his boundless energy and an insatiable sweet tooth. His mother had baked a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies, each one laden with sweetness, in preparation for their family picnic that day. Tommy managed to sneak off with a few extra cookies, unable to resist their enticing aroma and chewy texture.

His small body soon became a bubbling cauldron of pent-up energy, fueled by the excessive amounts of sugar he had just consumed. He turned on his favorite music and began to wiggle and leap around the living room. His movements became an impromptu dance performance, each beat of the rhythm absorbed by his candy-induced hyperactivity. The normally quiet space was filled with his giggles and the thundering rhythm of his feet against the hardwood floor. 

As his mother watched, she couldn't help but be amused, wondering if his short-lived burst of exuberance would end in an inevitable crash. True to her predictions, Tommy danced off his sugar high until his small body could not keep up anymore. Exhausted, he promptly fell asleep on the couch, his face still painted with a blissful smile, dreaming of another day filled with music and chocolate chip cookies.
D. After nearly twenty years of stressful nights, demanding clients, and countless court appearances, Smith reached a breaking point. The prestige of his profession as a lawyer couldn't fulfill his unmet craving for creativity and passion. One sunny morning, after a particularly gruelling trial, Smith sat alone in his office surrounded by piles of legal documents. 

He realized the law no longer excited him; instead, it felt like a heavy chain shackling his true passion - music. Since his youth, Smith had nurtured a deep love for singing, and even contemplated pursuing a career in music. But societal expectations and the allure of stability had guided him down the path of law.

Taking a leap of faith, Smith handed in his resignation, creating ripples of shock across the firm. With the support of his wife and children, he decided to channel his energy and talent into a new project - launching a YouTube channel for his singing videos. 

Smith dedicated his time to honing his vocal skills and producing high-quality videos, covering popular songs and occasionally sprinkling in his original pieces. The channel gradually gained traction, as viewers discovered the unique soulful voice hidden behind the lawyer facade. Despite the drastic career shift, Smith felt satisfied knowing that he was finally sharing his passion with the world.",B,s 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.............1.1......1.... the.1. the. the.1. the.1.. the. the.. the.. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the. the.

Among his scant possessions was a single china plate that he used for all his meals. One afternoon, as he was cleaning his plate, it slipped from his hands and shattered into a dozen pieces. Henry stared at the fragments in disbelief. 

""No,"" he murmured to himself. ""One can't eat from a broken plate."" His mind raced as he tried to come up with a solution. With a sigh, he realized he would have to save up to buy a new one. Until then, he would eat directly from the pot, reminding himself that even in adversity, life goes on.","A. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen.

B. Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it. My heart pounding in my chest will slowly become a normal rhythm, my fear will turn into a certain caution, and my journey, a routine I follow, unfazed. The darkness won't be a cause for terror anymore. Instead, the quiet streets will make me feel independent and strong.
C. A small rural town in Montana was known for its harsh weather conditions. Among them, strong winds were a usual occurrence, but no one anticipated how disastrous they could become. One day, a particularly severe windstorm swept through the town, creating much havoc and chaos. 

In the heart of the town stood a cell phone tower, a lifeline for the residents to the outside world. It was a tall, steel structure that had stood the test of time and weather over the years. Yet, the winds on this fateful day were relentless, howling like wolves, relentlessly battering against everything in their path. The tower tried to withstand the onslaught, but it was too much. 

The strong winds snapped many of the cables supporting the cellphone tower. The residents watched in despair as the tower began to lean, falter, then finally collapsed to the ground with a loud crash. In the blink of an eye, the town's main source of communication was destroyed, leaving them isolated in the face of the devastating storm.
D. John had always had a habit of arguing on the silliest topics. From the best way to fold socks to the correct angle to cut a sandwich, he always had a contrary opinion. It was as if he simply could not resist engaging in trivial disputes, the pettier the better. One day, his colleagues decided to test just how dedicated he was to his habit, so they began a debate over the color of the paperclips they used in the office.

John immediately entered into a fierce argument, insisting that red paperclips were superior in every way. His colleagues watched in bemusement as he railed on about the psychology of color and how red represented power and determination. Meanwhile, an important deadline was looming and work was piling up around them. They tried to refocus John's attention on the mounting tasks but to no avail. 

It was like he couldn't see the wood for the trees. In his fixation with arguing over insignificant matters, John was losing sight of the bigger picture and the real issues that needed his attention.",A,"s Motion P1ater is first T.

292,The water is flowing from a large beaker to a smaller one through a narrow pipe.,"In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.","A. In the heart of a cozy, rustic kitchen sat a pot-bellied, old-fashioned stove. It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.
B. The candle had been burning for hours, casting a warm glow across the room, but now its life was ending. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke. The smoke twirled and danced gracefully in the air, a subtle performance of nature, before slowly beginning to dissipate.

To John, who was quietly sitting across the room, this sequence of events felt oddly symbolic. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life - how something so beautiful and vibrant could just vanish in an instant, leaving behind a mere ghost of its existence. 

His mind traveled back to the year his mother had passed away. A once vivacious woman, her flame had too been dimmed by the cruel hands of cancer, leaving behind only memories - ephemeral wisp of smoke to grasp. 

He leaned back, closing his eyes, allowing himself to dive into the deeper depths of his thoughts, feeling the loss once again. He didn't know how long he sat there, lost in his thoughts, but when he opened his eyes again, the wisp of smoke had completely disappeared. The room was now submerged in darkness, the extinguished candle serving as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life.
C. He is the winner of three Grammy awards for god's sake! Damon “Zephyr” Lewis, often named the god of rap by his ardent followers and peers, is a name synonymous with talent, innovation, and sheer brilliance in the rap industry. His lyrics are a perfect blend of realism and imagination, provoking thought in the minds of his listeners.

Over the span of his career, he's bagged three prestigious Grammy awards, a testament to his unmatched mastery in his field. His first win was for his breakthrough album ""Whispers in the Wind,"" which explored the struggles and triumphs of inner-city life. The second Grammy arrived with his electric, politically charged album ""Grit and Glory,"" raising the bar even higher. 

His third Grammy, however, was a massive surprise - this time for Album of the Year, a category usually dominated by pop stars. Yet, Zephyr's ""Pulse of the Streets"" resonated with critics and listeners alike, a universally acclaimed masterpiece that transcended the boundaries of rap and penetrated the mainstream music industry. 

From his intricate lyrical craftsmanship to his unique beats, everything about Zephyr is a testament to his talent. It's not just the three Grammy awards; it's his revolutionary approach to rap that made people christen him as the god of rap. His journey from a simple boy from Compton to the god of rap, is an inspiration for aspiring rappers worldwide. The god of rap title does not only acknowledge his phenomenal artistry; it's a mark of his influence and standing in the music industry.
D. Harry Richardson, a savvy and seasoned politician, had spent his life mastering the art of political maneuvering. His charisma and charm were unmatched, but this time, he was facing a formidable opponent in the upcoming election, John Duncan. Though seemingly plain, Duncan's honesty and transparent policies were rapidly gaining popular appeal. It seemed as though the competition was going to be tougher than Harry had initially anticipated. 

Behind closed doors, Harry had crafted a secret plan, a wild card that he was certain would tip the scales in his favor. Weeks before the election, he received an anonymous tip about a scandal involving Duncan. He had spent painstaking hours verifying the information, ensuring not to leave any room for errors.

293,Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.,"Lake Erie is a beautiful and serene body of water, located in the northern part of the United States. This vast expanse of water is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from all corners of the world. Yet, one of the most fascinating aspects of Lake Erie is not just its beauty, but the role it plays in the complex and fascinating hydrological system of the Great Lakes.

Lake Erie drains its waters into another of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario. This transition of waters occurs via an extraordinary body of water, the Niagara River. The river is relatively short, merely 36 miles long, but plays an essential role in the transfer of waters between these two Great Lakes.

However, the journey from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not a simple, direct flow. The waters pass through a remarkable natural spectacle, the Niagara Falls. The thunderous roar of the Falls and the misty aura created by the falling water is a mesmerizing sight.

This journey of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is more than a geographical process. It serves as an embodiment of the dynamism and interconnectedness of nature. Above all, it's a reminder of the impermanence of things and the constancy of change, as the waters of Lake Erie perpetually flow into Lake Ontario, continuing the endless cycle of life.","A.

B. Detective Carson had chased him for years, the man only known as ""The Phantom,"" a notorious serial killer whose crimes had shocked the nation. At last, The Phantom had been caught, but in a twisted twist of events, he had requested to confess his crimes on national television. The broadcast studio was buzzing with intense activity, the air charged with a chilling mix of fear and anticipation. 

On that fateful evening, as millions sat glued to their screens, he was called on national television to talk about his crimes for everyone to listen directly from the serial killer. He strode onto the set, his eyes cold and emotionless, a stark contrast to the nervous faces surrounding him. The atmosphere was tense; one could hear a pin drop as he took his place in front of the camera, the harsh studio lights casting ominous shadows on his face.

As he started narrating his horrendous acts, a wave of fear and revulsion passed over the viewers. His words were cold, factual, devoid of any remorse or empathy. He detailed each crime with precision, a chilling testament to his twisted mind. The broadcast ended, leaving a terrified nation struggling to come to terms with the cruel reality of what they had just witnessed, the horrific confessions of a remorseless serial killer.
C. Once upon a time, I discovered a TV show that would soon become my all-time favorite. It had every element a good story should; suspense, drama, comedy, and characters so well drawn, they felt like old friends. From the moment the opening theme started playing, I was completely hooked.

Each episode was a roller coaster ride of emotions, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next one. Whenever a season would end, the wait for the next one felt like eternity. The plot was intriguing and the storytelling was nothing short of genius.

The heartache began when rumors started circulating about the show's cancellation. In the final season, I could see the story tying up, gearing up for a grand finale. While part of me was thrilled to witness such an epic ending, I also wished the TV show never ended.

Finally, it happened. The last episode aired, ending the show on an incredibly high note. And although it was undoubtedly spectacular, there was an undeniable sadness creeping in my heart. It was so good, but unfortunately, the writers thought it best to end it at this high point. They wanted the audience to remember the show at its best, they didn't want to drag it on and ruin it. As much as I respected their decision, I couldn't help but yearn for more episodes, more seasons, more time with the characters I had grown to love.
D. Samantha had always been a frugal young woman. The amount she had in her savings account was the result of years of careful spending and diligent saving. It was a security blanket, a nest egg for future endeavors, and possibly emergencies. And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue. She figured it was better to wait a few months when the rush of holiday travelers would die down, and prices would drop. By then, she would still have a substantial amount left in her savings after purchasing a ticket, and could even have extra money for her trip. In this way, Samantha was ensuring that she would not only have a memorable trip but also a financially secure future.",A,"# 10:00 AM

294,The parent tries to instill bits of knowledge in their child by simple communication.,"In a quiet suburban neighborhood, lived a curious young child named Tim with his intellectual parent, Sam. After spending long hours at his job as a university professor, Sam always put aside time for his most important role; being a father. The time spent with Tim was always focused on instilling bits of knowledge in him, mainly by simple communication. Each evening, they would sit in the living room surrounded by a sea of books, discussing life and all it entailed. 

Sam's teaching method was diverse, stretching from reading the classics to observing the nighttime stars. Each day was a new lesson, another chance to instill a nugget of wisdom in Tim. Conversations would range from the complex mathematical concepts to the symbiotic relationships in nature. Sam's intent was not just to make Tim knowledgeable, but also to help him see the world from different perspectives. 

He believed that the power of knowledge was rooted in understanding and analyzing, rather than rote memorization. Through these simple communication sessions, the seed of wisdom was being sown in Tim, a tradition he hoped his son would carry forward when he himself became a parent.","A.

I often observe the mischievous glint in Sophia's eyes, signaling the start of her afternoon escapades, and sigh in resignation, knowing full well what's about to transpire. The house resonates with her laughter, a prelude to her upcoming shenanigans.

Being a lively and inquisitive seven-year-old, she often dabbles into areas that she shouldn't. Last Tuesday, for instance, she ventured into my mom's carefully maintained garden and pulled out a bunch of marigold plants, just out of sheer curiosity to know what was underneath. That was followed by her pouring a whole jug of water into my mom's expensive, antique, rosewood china cabinet.

My mom has always doted on her and hardly ever gets angry. However, the frequency of such incidents can exhaust anyone. ""An idle brain is the devil’s workshop,"" I reminded my mom after that particular incident, emphasizing the need to engage Sophia in constructive activities, particularly during the afternoon.
B. In the corner of a dimly lit chemistry laboratory, the water is flowing from a large glass beaker to a smaller one through a narrow plastic pipe. The gentle gurgling sound of the transferring liquid echoed in the silence of the space, a testament to the late-night endeavors of its chief scientist, Dr. Jennings. He meticulously controlled the flow, his eyes trained intently on the glassware before him.

He was conducting a delicate experiment, an attempt to develop a new form of clean energy that involved the electrolysis of water. The large beaker, filled with pure distilled water, was beginning to decrease in volume as it steadily transported the water into the smaller one. A precisely controlled current was passing through the water, and the smaller beaker started to bubble with produced gases.

A silent digital timer, sitting beside the beakers, continued counting down the remaining reaction time. It was a critical moment that demanded absolute attention, one that could revolutionize the world's energy resources. Dr. Jennings held his breath, his heart mirrored the rhythm of the bubbling concoction. It was a sequence he'd rehearsed countless times in his mind; the water flowing from the large beaker to the smaller one through a narrow pipe was the first critical step towards a greener future.
C. On the day Chris blew out the candles on his 40th birthday cake, he had an epiphany. The monotonous life he was living as a software engineer began to feel too dull for his liking. A life filled with deadlines, alarm clocks, and office politics had left him feeling disillusioned. He yearned for the thrill and spontaneity that he had once enjoyed in his youth. And so, he decided to live his life in the fast lane and quit his job to pursue his hobbies.

Motorcycle racing and photography, both long forgotten passions, began to call out to him. The very next day, he handed in his resignation, allowing a sense of liberation to sweep over him. With his savings, he bought a brand new motorcycle and a professional camera. Every day was now an adventure, the open road and the perfect shot his new routine. Amidst the deafening sound of the motorcycle engine and the constant click of his camera, Chris found the joy that he had been searching for, redefining his life's purpose.
D. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. It's a bulky Dell model from 2006, dust collecting on its worn-out keys, and the other employees often joke about it. They can't comprehend why Lexi, the young, tech-savvy graphic designer, would choose such an obsolete piece of equipment. But she really enjoys using it.

There's something nostalgic about it; the satisfying click-clack of the keys, the faint humming noise, the old operating system. It reminds her of her first computer she got as a kid when she discovered her love for design. She was always fascinated by how she could create beautiful things with such a simple tool.

Lexi feels her creativity flowing more freely when she works on her old laptop, as if it's a part of her. The way she sees it, her best work comes not from the latest technology, but from her heart and dedication. So, until it completely gives out on her, she'll continue to cherish the oldest laptop in the office. Even though it's more antiquated than the others, for Lexi, it's priceless.",B,s 2013 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 2

It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.","A. Living with a roommate can be challenging, especially when it comes to housekeeping responsibilities. Jeremy found this out the hard way when he moved in with Mark. Just because his roommate, Mark, never cleaned up after himself, didn't mean Jeremy should too. Jeremy was raised with strong values of cleanliness and organisation.

At first, he tried to cope with the mess, hoping Mark would eventually pick up his clothes, wash his dishes, and take out the garbage. But as time went by, Jeremy realized that this change was unlikely to happen. Mark's careless attitude towards cleanliness was beginning to irk him. He decided not to let his roommate's bad habits influence him, he didn't want to lower his standards.

One day, he took it upon himself to discuss the situation with Mark, expressing his feelings about the ongoing mess. After a lengthy discussion, Mark agreed to make more of an effort, promising that their shared space would be more livable, which showed Jeremy that standing up for cleanliness was indeed the right decision.
B. Jimmy had spent the last few weeks fretting over his course selection for the next semester. He was a sophomore at the prestigious Canterbury University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. He had a deep interest in his field of study but deciding on what courses to take was proving to be a daunting task. The options were extensive and each course was as appealing as the other.

One afternoon, he decided to seek help and scheduled a meeting with Professor Marks. He was renowned in the University for his excellent teaching and deep knowledge of the field. Armed with a list of courses, Jimmy met with the professor. The professor's deep insight into each course, its prospects and challenges offered Jimmy a clear perspective about his choices.

By the end of the discussion, Jimmy felt less overwhelmed. He was reassured after consulting with the Professor Marks about what courses to take next semester, and he finally felt ready to take on the next step in his educational journey.
C. In the bustling state capital, politicians fervently debated the latest budget proposal. Part of the state budget, they realized, comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package. This spending package, while beneficial for some areas, sparked controversy nationwide due to its allocation towards controversial projects.

Governor Thompson, a seasoned politician, was troubled by this reality. He was aware of the constituents' growing concerns about accepting funds from a package that many of them fundamentally disagreed with. However, he also understood the dire need for financial resources in several underfunded areas within the state.

During a highly publicized town hall meeting, he addressed the issue head-on. He tried to explain the intricate balance of economics and politics involved in budget decisions. Many left the meeting still disgruntled, but a few seemed to appreciate the governor's honesty.

Thompson knew it was only the beginning of a long journey. Accepting the funds meant the ability to kick start much-needed initiatives in the state, but it also meant negotiating a delicate political landscape. He understood that as a leader, he had to face these difficult decisions, trying to serve his state's best interests amidst a sea of discord.
D. Ever since John graduated from college, he had been fixated on one particular company, Skyline Technologies. His friends and family had all told him it would be better if he applied to several companies instead of just one. However, John was always known to be a determined, if somewhat stubborn, individual who believed in putting all his eggs in one basket when it came to job hunting. 

After his countless applications, cover letters, and tweaked resumes sent to Skyline Technologies, he finally received a rejection email. He felt a rush of disappointment but realized his loved ones were right. He had missed out on multiple opportunities by focusing solely on one company. 

He started broadening his horizons, sending applications to different tech firms and receiving more responses than before. He went through a series of interviews and found that there were other companies he was equally interested in, if not more. Ultimately, he received three job offers, one of which offered even better prospects than Skyline Technologies. John learned a valuable lesson: there are more opportunities than we think, and we limit ourselves when we narrow our focus too much.",C,

They had been at odds for weeks now over a disagreement that had escalated far beyond what it should have. The bitter words, their heated argument, and its chilly aftermath still hung in the air like a dense fog. Their professional relationship was on the brink of breakdown, affecting not only them but also their entire team.

However, one morning, Ethan walked over to Emma's desk, a determined look on his face. His voice was steady and sincere as he proposed, ""Let's forget what happened and work on the project together."" There was a long silence; Emma looked at him, stunned. 

Ethan’s proposition seemed to permeate through the room, softening the harsh atmosphere that had been present for weeks. Emma took a deep breath, her mind processing his words. She finally gave a small nod, agreeing to put their differences aside for the sake of their project. Their colleagues let out a sigh of relief, hoping this marked the end of their disputes.

C. The war, which had raged on for several brutal years, had finally reached its conclusion. The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship. The war was over, and the world had chosen peace.
D. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.",B,
297,My tiny daily coffee expenses are draining up all my income.,"Every morning, I have a steadfast routine of strolling into the downtown cafe for my daily fix of caffeine. It's an indulgence I've always allowed myself, rationalizing that it's a small expense for such a big pleasure. A double-shot of espresso to start my day, a late morning latte, an afternoon cappuccino; coffee was my fuel, my lifeline. 

I never really thought about my tiny daily coffee expenses until I began to audit my finances. As a freelance graphic designer, my income was wildly inconsistent, but the expense for my coffee never faltered. When I sat down to pour over my bank statement, I was floored. The daily $5 here and $4 there had accumulated over the month into a sizable portion of my income. 

Staring at the numbers, I felt a knot in my stomach. I realized that my beloved coffee habit was draining up all my income. The decision was difficult, but inevitable; the time had come to invest in a coffee machine at home and drastically cut down on my cafe visits.","A. Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.
B. Lake Erie is a beautiful and serene body of water, located in the northern part of the United States. This vast expanse of water is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from all corners of the world. Yet, one of the most fascinating aspects of Lake Erie is not just its beauty, but the role it plays in the complex and fascinating hydrological system of the Great Lakes.

Lake Erie drains its waters into another of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario. This transition of waters occurs via an extraordinary body of water, the Niagara River. The river is relatively short, merely 36 miles long, but plays an essential role in the transfer of waters between these two Great Lakes.

However, the journey from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not a simple, direct flow. The waters pass through a remarkable natural spectacle, the Niagara Falls. The thunderous roar of the Falls and the misty aura created by the falling water is a mesmerizing sight.

This journey of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is more than a geographical process. It serves as an embodiment of the dynamism and interconnectedness of nature. Above all, it's a reminder of the impermanence of things and the constancy of change, as the waters of Lake Erie perpetually flow into Lake Ontario, continuing the endless cycle of life.
C. For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of numbers. Their jumbled mess and chaos-filled order always seemed to elude me, triggering bouts of anxiety. But this particular weekend, I had resolved to face my fear head-on. I had set my mind to go through the spreadsheets by Monday, a task that loomed ominously on my to-do list.

Every cell filled with digits seemed like a coded message I had to decipher. However, as arduous the task felt, I had a mission to accomplish. I was working for it hook, line, and sinker. Fuelled with a strong coffee by my side, my fingers flew over the keyboard, finding their rhythm in the mechanical clicking sounds.

Progress was slow but steady and by Sunday night, I was surprised at the sea of green that covered the monitor screen indicating corrections. As the moon set and the sun began to peek from the horizon on Monday, a feeling of accomplishment washed over me. I had done it; I had conquered the spreadsheets, and most importantly, my fear of numbers.
D. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.",B,s and the other day.

298,The father told the son that it was his way or the highway when the son came back home drunk.,"Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.","A. Sally had always been the type to avoid strenuous physical activity; she had never stepped foot in a gym. Her trepidation stemmed from a deep-seated fear of lifting weights. It wasn't so much the physical effort that bothered her, but the fear of doing it wrong and injuring herself. She had seen news stories of gym-related accidents and didn't want to become another statistic.

Recently, however, a change had come over Sally. She began to realize that her sedentary lifestyle was not only affecting her physical health, but her mental wellbeing too. She noticed her friends were happier, more active, and seemed to have a spark that she lacked. They all had one thing in common: they all regularly attended the gym.

After lengthy conversations about their gym experiences and how they started off as novices themselves, Sally started to show some interest. Her friends even introduced her to a trainer who assured her he'd guide her through the weightlifting process. Encouraged, Sally decided to shake off her fears. She finally committed and announced with newfound determination that she would start going to the gym soon.
B. The local soccer match had been in progress for the better part of two hours and had been a thrilling spectacle from the get-go. The two teams, evenly matched, were engaged in a fierce duel for supremacy. Both had managed to net two goals each, creating an electric atmosphere in the stadium. The roaring crowd was on edge, waiting for the decisive moment that would tilt the balance.

Then, in the 87th minute, it happened. The home team's star forward, known for his swift agility and strategic dribbling, outpaced his rivals and ran toward the opponent's goal post. The opposition's goalkeeper was alert, eyes trained on every movement of the forward.

Despite his best efforts, the forward managed to artfully maneuver the ball around him, driving it toward the far post. The moment froze as everyone watched the ball soar through the air and nestle into the net. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal, causing an eruption of euphoria among the home team's supporters.
C. After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.
D. Once upon a time, Mark and John were neighbors who didn't get along very well. They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them. One rainy day, John's basement was flooded, leaving his family in a state of distress.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were. They both chuckled over their previous arguments, understanding how senseless their hostility was. So one day, as they stood in the backyard, Mark smiled and said to John, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

From that day onward, they didn't just share a boundary wall, but a great friendship too, showing how adversity could sometimes bring out the best in people.",C,

They had assembled to address the employees about the drastic changes about to take place in the company. The air in the room was fraught with tension as the management finally began to speak. 

""We value your dedication and effort,"" they began, ""but the market scenario is drastically changing and we need to adapt."" Their tone was firm, a clear indication of the seriousness of the situation. They continued, ""To survive, we've outlined some new policies which will require significant adjustment from everyone."" 

The employees glanced at each other, uncertainty etched on their faces. The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go. The words hung heavy in the room; the ultimatum had been delivered with a stark finality. The employees were left to wrestle with the tough choice of either complying with the impending changes or losing their jobs entirely.","A. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
B. Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.
C. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.

Every year, the boutique downtown hosts a spectacular sale. They drop the prices on all their luxury items, making it an event fashion enthusiasts in town don't dare to miss. Over the years, I've learned one important lesson: We should go early to the boutique on the day of their sale to get the best stuff. 

The early bird catches the worm, as they say. The boutique opens at 8 am sharp on the sale day, but the line begins to form as early as 5 am. The most dedicated shopaholics even camp out overnight, trying to secure their place at the front of the line. They make the chilly dawn more than worth it with their triumphant smiles when they emerge from the boutique, their arms full of bags and their hearts full of satisfaction. 

If we want to take part in this fashion frenzy, then we need to plan. It isn't just about getting there early, it's about knowing what we want, grabbing it quickly, and getting it before someone else does. So let's get our coffee brewing at 4 am, brave the morning chill, and join the hustle of the boutique sale. This way, we won't just witness the event, we'll be victors of the fashion battlefield.
B. After weeks of hunting for a place to stay, I finally found a modest apartment. The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.
C. At the monthly corporate meeting, the management sat across a large polished table, their faces stern and resolute. They had assembled to address the employees about the drastic changes about to take place in the company. The air in the room was fraught with tension as the management finally began to speak. 

""We value your dedication and effort,"" they began, ""but the market scenario is drastically changing and we need to adapt."" Their tone was firm, a clear indication of the seriousness of the situation. They continued, ""To survive, we've outlined some new policies which will require significant adjustment from everyone."" 

The employees glanced at each other, uncertainty etched on their faces. The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go. The words hung heavy in the room; the ultimatum had been delivered with a stark finality. The employees were left to wrestle with the tough choice of either complying with the impending changes or losing their jobs entirely.
D. Claire had always formed an opinion about Max from afar. His wardrobe choices, from the spiked leather jackets to the studded boots, made him seem intimidating. His piercing gaze and rough exterior indicated him to be unkind and rude in her eyes. His earrings, dark makeup, and almost always black attire, made it seem like he was deliberately setting himself apart from everyone else, and Claire interpreted that as a sign of his indifference towards others.

One day, by a twist of fate, she was partnered with him for a school project. As she began spending more time with him, she observed a very different side of Max. She witnessed his interactions with his younger sister, full of kindness and patience. Max was extremely considerate; he always listened attentively to Claire's thoughts and ideas about their project, contrary to her initial assumption about his rudeness.

She saw Max intervene when a stray cat was being harassed by some kids and was moved by his sensitivity. Once, when Claire was going through a personal crisis, Max's comforting words provided her the strength to confront the situation. The realization of Max’s kindness and sensitivity took her by surprise, making her realize that edgy fashion does not necessarily correspond to a harsh personality.",C,s and the 190s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s and the 10s.
301,The technical lead informed the team that they have to follow his ideas for the project to be completed without question or risk failure.,"The meeting room was filled with an ominous silence as George, the technical lead, addressed his team. ""In order to meet the project deadlines,"" he began, ""it is paramount that everyone follows my strategies and ideas without hesitation or disagreement."" The tension in the room escalated as he continued, reminding them of the looming deadline and the mounting stakes of their project. 

His team shared exchanged uneasy glances. Was it out of fear? Frustration? They were, after all, a group of skilled, professional individuals, each with their unique ideas and perspectives that have propelled previous projects to success. 

Sarah, the newest member, couldn't help but question whether this authoritarian approach was the best way to achieve their goals. But, she swallowed her doubts, not wanting to upset the team dynamics just yet. They all nodded in agreement, signalling their acceptance of George's directive. 

To succeed, they would now have to abide by his strict rules, willingly silencing their own thoughts. The future of the project hinged on their collective obedience and the effectiveness of George's plans. Failure was not an option, but at what cost?","A. I had been telling you for weeks, constantly pestering you to go see a doctor. But you were stubborn, choosing to ignore the persistent cough that seemed to grow worse with each passing day. I hated how you always pushed away concerns about your health, your dismissive attitude was infuriating. You continued to tell me it was nothing more than a seasonal cold, that it would pass.

One day, we woke up to the alarming sound of you gasping for breath, unable to stand on your own. We rushed to the hospital where the doctors hooked you to machines. The sterile smell of the hospital, the muffled sounds of patients and the constant beep of monitors filled the air. 

A grim looking doctor entered the room, removing his spectacles as he prepared to deliver the news. He looked at you and said, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier."" His voice carried a tone of regret and guilt, ""They still could have cured you then."" Your stubbornness had let a simple cold progress into pneumonia that was now threatening your life.
B. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.
C. The presentation was such a mess, it was painfully obvious to everyone in the room. The presenters, two bright-eyed interns, had been tasked with delivering an overview of the company's annual financial reports. Unfortunately, their endeavor turned out to be a chaotic whirlwind of facts and figures, crammed into a brief 30-minute slot.

They dashed through slides, spewing numbers and data with reckless abandon. The pace was far too frenetic; audience members shot each other bewildered glances, completely lost. There was a wealth of information on display but without context, it was impossible to glean any real value from it.  

The interns seemed completely oblivious to the lack of clarity their presentation provided. The room grew increasingly tense as their speech went on. At last, when they concluded with a rushed thanks to the baffled audience, the sighs of relief were audible. A general consensus was reached - never again should so much information be attempted to be conveyed in such a short time.
D. After another long, arduous week of work, I sat down at the dinner table with my wife. We had been negotiating, discussing, and, on occasion, arguing about our day-to-day life decisions and how to balance them. As I saw her tired face, I made a conscious decision, I would agree to compromise on most of the things to keep the peace and harmony at home.

""Sweetheart,"" I began, my voice gentle yet firm. ""I will give in to most of the things you have asked of me. I will accompany you to the community meetups I find slightly monotonous. I will spend less time tinkering around in the garage, which I know you complain takes up a lot of our weekends.""

My wife began to smile, appreciating my effort to meet her halfway. But then I added, ""However, when it comes to holidays, I want the freedom to do whatever I wish. I believe it's fair that we both should have time where we don't have to compromise but simply enjoy ourselves.""

After their eldest son became a nutritionist, mealtimes in the Mathews family household had become quite a contentious issue. The son constantly critiqued the family's meal choices, suggesting healthier alternatives. One evening, the tension rose to a climax when he made a particularly harsh comment about his mother's famous lasagna, saying it was too rich in fats and carbs. The wife, Helen, who had been patient until then, finally decided it was time to lay down the law.

""The kitchen is my domain,"" she declared firmly. ""And since I am the one in charge of it, the family will eat what I make or go hungry."" The room fell silent. The husband, sitting at the head of the table, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in agreement. He believed that his wife's food was cooked with love and he cherished every meal she made. From that day onwards, the son began to appreciate his mother's culinary skills and kept his nutritionist’s remarks reserved for his professional domain.
B. Philip was a dedicated software engineer, a genius in his own right, engrossed in a challenging project. It was a complicated task that required immense concentration and his complete attention. Thus, Philip decided he needed to dedicate an entire day solely to this project, eliminating all potential distractions.

Before plunging into his work, he looked around at his desk cluttered with a multitude of devices, each pinging with notifications and reminders. Aware of their tempting, disruptive potential, he resolved to turn every single one of them off, a decision he rarely made. He powered down his smartphone, tablet, and even his smartwatch, silencing all of his digital diversions. A feeling of silence enveloped him, which was alien yet oddly comforting.

With the distractions abated, Philip found himself entirely in the zone, solving complex coding problems he had previously found insurmountable. The day stretched into evening, and Philip remained engrossed in his work, only pausing for the briefest of breaks. By the time the moon was high in the sky, Philip finally sat back, satisfied. His day of intense focus had paid off, he had completed his project, proving to himself the power of undisturbed concentration.
C. The bell rang for the next class but there was no teacher in sight. The students, realizing they were momentarily unsupervised, started acting out. What began as innocent fun quickly escalated into chaos. The normally disciplined class turned into a playground. Papers were thrown across the room like snowballs, markers and pencils became dart missiles and textbooks were used as makeshift footballs. 

Laughter echoed as desks were shifted, creating little forts and barricades. The once neat and organized room now resembled the aftermath of a stampede. The noise reached its crescendo, until suddenly, the door flung open. A shocked silence fell upon the room as the late-arriving teacher stepped in, taking in the spectacle. The students, knowing they were in trouble, quickly scrambled to fix the mess they had created in the class.
D. Once upon a time, a man named Henry lived in a tiny, worn-out house. He was a man of humble means and owned very little. Among his scant possessions was a single china plate that he used for all his meals. One afternoon, as he was cleaning his plate, it slipped from his hands and shattered into a dozen pieces. Henry stared at the fragments in disbelief. 

""No,"" he murmured to himself. ""One can't eat from a broken plate."" His mind raced as he tried to come up with a solution. With a sigh, he realized he would have to save up to buy a new one. Until then, he would eat directly from the pot, reminding himself that even in adversity, life goes on.",A,"P.

303,"If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit.","The boss of the packaging factory, Mr. Harrison, was known for his demanding work ethic. For him, the productivity of his factory was the top priority. So he set a rule for his workers: a minimum of 20 hours a week, no exceptions.

However, this rule wasn't welcomed warmly by the workers. The weekly shift was interfering with their personal lives and creating a stressful work environment. They protested against the rule, asking for more flexibility.

But Mr. Harrison didn't heed their concerns. Instead, he retorted, ""If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit."" This statement left the workers aghast. They were left pondering on the tough choice between their job and their well-being.","A. Last night, the son, Eric, decided to ignore his father's warnings and returned home drunk, a bottle of cheap whiskey still clutched in his hand. His normally loving and lenient father, Greg, had always turned a blind eye to his son's vices, but seeing him in such a state alarmed him beyond words. Today, Greg decided to put his foot down. 

""Eric,"" the father said sternly when his son stumbled through the front door, ""this isn't a game anymore. It's my way or the highway."" His voice was firm, filled with resolve and anguish. Greg wasn't one for ultimatums, but his heart was heavy with worry for his wayward son. 

Eric looked at his father, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He heard the words, but they echoed meaninglessly in his intoxicated mind. The son might not have understood the weight of his father's words that night, but he knew something had changed between them. From that point forward, there was an understanding: either he would adhere to his father's rules, or he would have to find his own path.
B. Mary was a great enthusiast for books and had been since she was a little girl. From fairy tales to historical biographies, classic novels to latest bestsellers, she loved them all. She began her collection with a book given by her grandmother. Years had passed and that one book multiplied exponentially. Every room of her house was practically brimming with books. She had acquired so many books over the years that her home became cluttered with stacks upon stacks of them. 

One day, while navigating through the towers of literature, an idea sprung to her mind. With all these books, she had enough to start her own library. She decided to transform her large basement into a library, organizing each book by genre and author. This way, her love for books could be shared with others, and they could enjoy the vast collection she had amassed over the years.
C. A stormy morning on the coast revealed an awe-inspiring sight as a succession of waves battered the rock. The water, with its furious strength, launched assault after assault against the solitary rock formation standing stoically in the sea. Its ferocity mirrored the tempestuous mood of the sky, dark and threatening, with thunder rumbling in the distance. Each surge of salty sea foam cascaded against the stone, trying to erode its resilience.

Despite this onslaught, the rock remained unmoving, unyielding against this unrelenting natural force. The rock, defiant in its existence, held its position steadfastly. Its surface was hardened by years of enduring such challenges, its foundation deeply rooted beneath the seabed. It almost seemed to embrace the relentless barrage, standing its ground as a testament to its inherent strength and endurance.

Hours passed and as the storm gradually subsided, the waves lost their raw energy. Eventually, calmness returned, leaving the solitary rock, still standing tall, proving it could withstand the fiercest battering that nature could muster.
D. Mr. Davis, a seasoned mathematics teacher, had been grappling with the challenging task of explaining the concept of calculus to his class. Over several weeks, he'd attempted various methods, yet felt he hadn't fully reached his students. His frustration was growing, but he refused to give up, knowing the importance of this particular topic.

One day, he stumbled upon an interactive mathematics game online, which presented complex topics in a simplified, engaging manner. With newfound optimism, he decided to incorporate this method into his teaching. The following day, he introduced the game to his students, explaining that it would be their new means of understanding calculus. 

As the days passed, he watched their progress closely, anticipating that he was onto something. Soon, their class participation, homework submissions, and test scores indicated a surge in understanding. It was the day when one of the most quiet students voluntarily solved a complex problem on the board that Mr. Davis knew he had finally succeeded. The teacher was ecstatic that he had finally succeeded in explaining the complex topic for the students. His sense of accomplishment radiated through the classroom, bringing a new energy that inspired even more learning.",A,"PAR the most MoretoretcustheaterVAaatermoretoretoret otheratergency.

304,"Every evening, many drinkers get together in a bar near our home. You know, birds of a feather flock together.","Every evening, as the sun dips below the horizon, a particular ritual unfolds near our home. Many drinkers, drawn to their local sanctuary of libations, converge on a quaint little bar tucked away on the corner of our street. The bar, an inviting oasis of warmth and camaraderie, stands as a beacon for the weary, its neon sign flickering against the encroaching darkness.

You know, there's something almost poetic about the whole thing, the manner in which these like-minded individuals gather. It brings to mind the old adage, ""Birds of a feather flock together."" Perhaps for them, this nightly assembly offers an escape, a familiar comfort in shared experiences and quiet camaraderie.

They laugh, they bicker, they share stories from days long past or hopes of better tomorrows. Each one, despite their diverse backgrounds, connected by an invisible thread of shared comfort and routine. The clinking of glasses, the hum of conversation, it all forms an intoxicating symphony of life in its most raw and unfiltered form.

Yes, every evening, just as surely as the sun retreats to make way for the moon, many drinkers get together in that small bar near our home. Because, after all, birds of a feather really do flock together.","A. We all begin our lives in the same humble manner, as innocent and inexperienced infants, new to the world and unaware of its complexities. From the moment we open our eyes for the first time, we are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth. Initially, our world is limited to our mother's soothing voice, the tender touch of a parent, and the comforting warmth of a swaddle.

Slowly, however, our world begins to expand. We learn about the brilliance of colors and the enchanting symphony of sounds, both near and far. Soon, we are crawling and exploring, eager to touch everything around us. Our innocent curiosity forms the foundation of our learning and knowledge. 

Our physical growth goes hand in hand with our intellectual growth, as we advance from taking our first wobbly steps to running freely. We begin our journey by mimicking our parents, but as we learn and grow, we develop our unique characteristics and skills. Thus, our lives are an ongoing series of transitions - we start as babies, evolve into children, bloom into adults, and continue to learn and grow with each passing phase.
B. The once united local soccer club now presents a vastly different scene. Recently, it's been divided into distinct groups. Intriguingly, these groups are divided on regional lines. Each region in the neighborhood has its representative group at the club. This unique approach has spurred a friendly rivalry among the members and instilled a new sense of enthusiasm.

Despite the division, the members within each group share a deep bond. They come together multiple times a week, meeting regularly on the green expanse of the soccer field. Hours are spent practicing and perfecting their skills, their dedication almost palpable. They motivate and support each other, fostering a sense of camaraderie that seeps beyond the soccer field.

Meanwhile, the matches between the regional groups have become a spectacle that the entire community looks forward to. They create an energetic atmosphere as they proudly cheer for their representatives. Amidst all the competition and rivalry, the groups have unwittingly brought the whole neighborhood together, strengthening the sense of unity in their community.
C. Listen, losing weight is a goal that many strive for but it's easier said than done. You often hear people make New Year's resolutions, vowing to shed those extra pounds and embrace a healthier lifestyle. The gyms are crowded in January, filled with hopeful and determined individuals all set to work off their holiday indulgences. 

However, as the months roll on, you will observe that the gym crowd starts to thin out. Their early enthusiasm fizzles as the reality of the effort and commitment required to lose weight dawns on them. The once active treadmill is not occupied as often anymore and the energy in the gym declines.

Many people lack the commitment needed to consistently work towards weight loss. It requires a long-term plan and a consistent effort, not just a few weeks of rigorous exercise. This lack of commitment is often due to people wanting quick results, and when they don't get them, they feel discouraged and quit. It's a cycle that keeps repeating, proving that losing weight is indeed easier said than done.
D. Rory looked over at her mother, watching as her eyes lit up in a way that they hadn't in months. She could see her mother's chest heaving in joy and relief, absorbing the sound of her eldest son's voice over the line after what felt like an eternity. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, showcasing the happiness on her face. 

For years Rory's brother had been living abroad, in a remote part of the world, chasing a dream that their family had been unable to comprehend. Letters were infrequent and phone calls even rarer, a fact that had taken its toll on their mother. The worry lines etched on her face had deepened each day that passed without a word from him. 

But today, today was different. The call from her son had made her forget all her worries in an instant. She laughed heartily into the phone, joyfully recalling old memories. Rory, watching this transformation, couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over her. She could see the happiness on her mother's face as her brother called after ages.

305,I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.,"Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.","A. Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.
B. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.

306,"The fancy Michelin-star restaurant seems to attract a homogeneous clientele, who all appear to wear the same fashion and be around the same age.","Nestled in the heart of the city was an exquisite Michelin-star restaurant, Le Gourmet, which had developed a reputation for attracting a surprisingly homogeneous clientele. Every evening, the restaurant would be thrumming with an assortment of well-heeled individuals, all seemingly cut from the same cloth. The patrons were so strikingly similar, it was like the restaurant had a dress code and an age restriction.

The majority of them would arrive adorned in the latest designer attire, reflecting their devotion to fashion. The women dripped with pearls and diamonds and the men donned bespoke suits, with signature timepieces ticking away at their wrists. The guests all appeared to be in their late 40s to early 50s, a sea of silver and salt-and-pepper head, exuding an air of sophistication and success.

Curious onlookers would often watch them from a distance, marveling at their uniformity, and speculating about the demographic the restaurant seemed to draw. Conversations on the sidewalk would be peppered with wild theories - ""Perhaps it's a secret society,"" a passerby would joke. Regardless of the reason, the distinctive clientele added a layer of intrigue and elegance to the restaurant's already esteemed reputation.

In the world of gastronomy, where uniqueness is the gold standard, it was ironic that Le Gourmet's patrons appeared remarkably alike. The fancy Michelin-star restaurant, in its unspoken uniformity, created its own brand of exclusivity, making it even more alluring to those who aspired to be part of its elusive circle.","A. In the bustling state capital, politicians fervently debated the latest budget proposal. Part of the state budget, they realized, comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package. This spending package, while beneficial for some areas, sparked controversy nationwide due to its allocation towards controversial projects.

Governor Thompson, a seasoned politician, was troubled by this reality. He was aware of the constituents' growing concerns about accepting funds from a package that many of them fundamentally disagreed with. However, he also understood the dire need for financial resources in several underfunded areas within the state.

During a highly publicized town hall meeting, he addressed the issue head-on. He tried to explain the intricate balance of economics and politics involved in budget decisions. Many left the meeting still disgruntled, but a few seemed to appreciate the governor's honesty.

Thompson knew it was only the beginning of a long journey. Accepting the funds meant the ability to kick start much-needed initiatives in the state, but it also meant negotiating a delicate political landscape. He understood that as a leader, he had to face these difficult decisions, trying to serve his state's best interests amidst a sea of discord.
B. Ever since I was a little boy, I've had an undeniable fascination with computers. I would spend countless hours studying them, intrigued by their capabilities. I eagerly observed how these machines worked and yearned for more insight into this revolutionary technology. I love to talk to people who know about computers because I enjoy learning about computers.

The conversations I have with tech-savvy individuals are incredibly captivating. Their wide range of knowledge about different programming languages, network systems, and data processing leaves me yearning to learn more. Every interaction I have with them is a learning opportunity for me. I listen intently, soaking in every bit of information I can, and applying it to my understanding of computer systems. Each discussion helps me gain a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of technology.

In my pursuit to quench my thirst for computer knowledge, these interactions have fueled my passion to the point where it's not just about understanding computers anymore. It's about being part of a community that shares a love and understanding of this incredible technology.
C. Frank had been all around the world, from bustling cities to desolate deserts, in pursuit of his career. A translator by profession, his work took him far and wide, away from the comfort of his small town in New Hampshire. Being a diligent and committed man, Frank invested years in adapting to diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. But, he always yearned for the familiarity and comfort of his hometown. 

One winter, after a decade overseas, Frank decided to return home. He was ecstatic as he packed his bags, each piece of clothing he folded bringing him one step closer to the solace he missed. The journey felt nostalgic as he drove through the sleepy lanes leading to his quaint wooden house. 

Finally, Frank found himself in his old room, staring at the childhood bed that bore witness to his dreams of adventure. The sight of the bed, washed in the soft, warm glow of his old table lamp, invited him with an embrace of familiarity. That night, he crawled under his worn-out quilt, and for the first time in years, Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed, surrounded by the soothing aura of his home country.
D. In the heart of a small, poverty-stricken village, the weather began to take a frightful turn. Ominous grey clouds darkened the sky, casting long, heavy shadows on the poorly built shacks below. Inhabitants of the village huddled inside their homes, bracing for the impending storm. Suddenly, an unrestrained gust of wind blew fiercely, bellowing through the narrow alleys.

The gust was strong and merciless, shaking the frail structures of the shacks as though they were mere toys. One by one, the shacks trembled and creaked under the wind's mighty wrath, their feeble resistance proving futile. Families could only watch helplessly as their homes crumbled around them, swept away by the vengeful gust.

And then, just as quickly as it had arrived, the violent wind ebbed, leaving behind a deafening silence and devastation. A soft breeze blew through the village next, as if nature was seeking to soothe the pain it had caused. The breeze gently kissed the cheeks of the shocked villagers, whispering an apology in their ears, but the fallen shacks were a cruel reminder of the havoc that had been wrought.",B,"C.

307,The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves.,"The lawyers had traveled from various parts of the country to attend a prestigious business seminar in New York City. Dressed in crisp, expensive suits, they filled the room with an air of unspoken competition. Upon arrival, they had collected their name badges, exchanged courteous nods and pleasantries, and found their seats. 

As the seminar progressed, they listened intently to the speakers, taking meticulous notes and absorbing every new piece of information. The seminar was filled with informative sessions about business law, the evolving business environment, and how lawyers could adapt to these changes.

During the breaks, they began to form little clusters, engaging in heated discussions about the subjects at hand. The lawyers who attended the business seminar talked amongst themselves, dissecting the new strategies and theories presented. Opinions were shared, a healthy debate ensued, and insights were gained. 

The interactions at the seminar led to new connections and strengthened old ones. By the time the business seminar concluded, it was evident that the attending lawyers had not just learnt from the speakers, but also from each other.","A. Sally had always been a strong-willed woman who stood firm in her beliefs. She belonged to a faith that was not widely accepted in her community, but this never deterred her from expressing her devotion. Her conviction was unwavering; her belief firm and resolute. Her religion was her sanctuary, a place of solace where she found comfort during tumultuous times.

She had always dreamed of having a traditional ceremony, a sacred ritual of her faith. Her friends and family, fearing social judgement, had advised her against it. They felt that her public display of faith could lead to hostility from others, but Sally was adamant. She was determined to show her commitment and dedication to her faith.

With great resilience, Sally began preparations for the ceremony, undeterred by the discouraging voices around her. On the day of the ceremony, dressed in the traditional attire of her faith, she stood proud and confident. Her eyes shone with determination, and she carried out each ritual with an unwavering conviction. Sally was stubborn about her religious beliefs, and she went through with the ceremony, demonstrating her strong faith and challenging societal norms.
B. Derek, the seasoned poker player, stared intently at the hand he was dealt. His cool, calm, collected exterior masked the thrill rushing through his veins. After hours of mediocre hands, this was the one he'd been waiting for - a straight flush in spades. The corners of his lips tilted upwards in a barely visible smile. 

Across the table, his opponents, a tough group of poker regulars, continued their tactical bluffing, unaware of Derek's excitement. He matched their bets without hesitation, his confident eyes never wavering. Round after round, he kept calling, his pile of chips dwindling steadily. 

Finally, the last round arrived and with a deep breath, Derek pushed his remaining chips into the center. He had staked all his money, leaving his fate at the mercy of the cards. The room held its breath, waiting for the reveal, intrigued to see whether Derek's confidence was well-founded or misplaced.
C. The once united local soccer club now presents a vastly different scene. Recently, it's been divided into distinct groups. Intriguingly, these groups are divided on regional lines. Each region in the neighborhood has its representative group at the club. This unique approach has spurred a friendly rivalry among the members and instilled a new sense of enthusiasm.

Despite the division, the members within each group share a deep bond. They come together multiple times a week, meeting regularly on the green expanse of the soccer field. Hours are spent practicing and perfecting their skills, their dedication almost palpable. They motivate and support each other, fostering a sense of camaraderie that seeps beyond the soccer field.

Meanwhile, the matches between the regional groups have become a spectacle that the entire community looks forward to. They create an energetic atmosphere as they proudly cheer for their representatives. Amidst all the competition and rivalry, the groups have unwittingly brought the whole neighborhood together, strengthening the sense of unity in their community.
D. Kate had always been a hardworking and dedicated employee, until one day, she was unjustly fired from her job. The sudden dismissal left her in shock and disillusioned about her future. She was used to spending her days in a fast-paced environment, solving problems and meeting deadlines. Now, she found herself waking up to days with no purpose and nothing to do.

After getting fired and having nothing else to do, Kate spent her days imagining schemes to get the boss fired. She found solace and amusement in these imaginative revenge plans. Whether it was gathering and leaking sensitive information or creating a scandal that would discredit him in front of the board, she crafted each plot meticulously, never intending to execute them. It was just a harmless way for her to channel her frustration and betrayal.

Even though she was desperate and jobless, she never really considered implementing any of her vengeful plans. But, indulging in these fantasies served as a coping mechanism to deal with her abrupt unemployment. As days passed, these revengeful fantasies eventually lost their charm and Kate decided to use her time constructively.

Jeremy had known Rick for years, ever since they were young boys playing football on the neighborhood streets. Their friendship had always been rocky, filled with competitive banter and rivalry. Over time, Jeremy realized Rick's friendship wasn't as genuine as it seemed. Rick was more inclined towards the glitz of wealth and constantly pursued money. He was the kind of person who'd turn his back on his friends if it meant getting a bigger piece of the pie. 

Despite this, Jeremy didn't cut ties with Rick. He was aware that Rick's intentions were shallow and centered around his own self-interest. Nonetheless, Jeremy decided to continue his friendship with Rick, albeit with more caution and less trust. He figured he could manage to get along with him for the time being, at least until the dynamics of their relationship changed. It was a harsh reality to accept but Jeremy found comfort in the knowledge that he understood Rick's motives and could navigate their relationship accordingly.
B. We arrived at the meeting point, a small café downtown, around noon. The sky was brilliantly clear, the air heavy with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You, however, were nowhere to be found. We exchanged glances but decided to wait, hoping that the traffic was the cause of your delay.

An hour passed, followed by another, and soon it was three hours. Our coffees had turned cold, our spirits were slightly low but there was a strange determination in our hearts. ""We have been waiting for you for three hours,"" I remember Susan murmured. Yet, her voice lacked any trace of annoyance or frustration. Instead, there was an element of forgiveness, and she added, ""But that's okay. It’s better late than never.""
C. Every evening, as the sun dips below the horizon, a particular ritual unfolds near our home. Many drinkers, drawn to their local sanctuary of libations, converge on a quaint little bar tucked away on the corner of our street. The bar, an inviting oasis of warmth and camaraderie, stands as a beacon for the weary, its neon sign flickering against the encroaching darkness.

You know, there's something almost poetic about the whole thing, the manner in which these like-minded individuals gather. It brings to mind the old adage, ""Birds of a feather flock together."" Perhaps for them, this nightly assembly offers an escape, a familiar comfort in shared experiences and quiet camaraderie.

They laugh, they bicker, they share stories from days long past or hopes of better tomorrows. Each one, despite their diverse backgrounds, connected by an invisible thread of shared comfort and routine. The clinking of glasses, the hum of conversation, it all forms an intoxicating symphony of life in its most raw and unfiltered form.

Yes, every evening, just as surely as the sun retreats to make way for the moon, many drinkers get together in that small bar near our home. Because, after all, birds of a feather really do flock together.
D. She was the talk of the town, spinning outrageous stories about everyone, giving them enough reasons to loathe her presence. She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.",C,s.

309,All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.,"The annual International Technology Summit was teeming with professionals from different walks of life, all seeking to expand their horizons, acquire new knowledge and network. Among this multitude, an interesting phenomenon was taking place; all the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together. They naturally gravitated towards their own groups, their shared passions creating an unseen but potent attraction. 

The A.I enthusiasts, buzzing with excitement, were deep in conversation about the latest machine learning innovations. A cluster of cyber-security experts were engaged in a heated debate about blockchain technology and its potential implications for their field. Those passionate about e-commerce were discussing the impact of AR and VR on online shopping experiences. 

Meanwhile, the environmental technology advocates were discussing renewable energy alternatives and their integration into everyday life. The data scientists, on the other hand, were delving into the world of big data, exchanging insights on how best to harness and interpret it. In a corner, the cloud computing specialists were discussing the shift towards serverless architectures and the future of digital storage. 

Despite the diversity of their subjects, a sense of camaraderie marked each group. United by shared interests, they were all part of the dynamic world of technology, bridging gaps and paving the way for a shared future.","A.

B. The four-member team had been working relentlessly for the past week on a crucial project for their company. They were a diverse mix, their talents ranging from data analysis to marketing strategy. Every individual was under enormous pressure to deliver as the competition was fierce. The last stretch was the most challenging, filled with late nights, heated discussions, and countless cups of coffee.

The day of the deadline, they were still polishing up the final details. Even a slight error could cost them the project, making the atmosphere in the room tense. It felt like they were racing against the clock, scrambling to validate all data and ensure every point in their proposal was presented convincingly. 

Eventually, they managed to wrap up their work, each of them with a sigh of relief. They carefully compiled their findings into a comprehensive report, filled with charts, graphs, and innovative solutions. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline, their faces reflecting a mixture of exhaustion, anxiety, and a glimmer of triumph.
C. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.
D. After a long day at work, Sam staggered out of his office towards the parking lot. He unlocked his car, throwing his briefcase onto the backseat before sinking into the driver's seat. However, when he inserted his keys and turned on the ignition, all he heard was a sputtering noise. He tried again, but the car refused to come to life, only giving out faint, distressed sounds.

With a sinking feeling, he glanced at the fuel gauge. It was on empty. A frustrated groan escaped his lips as he remembered passing the gas station earlier, opting not to stop, thinking he had enough fuel to last the trip home. He now realized how wrong he was. ""I guess I've learned the hard way,"" he muttered, reaching for his phone to call a tow truck. ""You can't drive a car with no fuel.""",A,"```

310,"You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap. Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound.","John had always been a cautious man, particularly when it came to his investments. He had a substantial number of shares in a major tech company, shares that he'd held onto for several years. Recently, though, the market had taken a downturn and the value of his shares had plummeted. Panicked, he was on the verge of making a hasty decision to sell all his shares to avoid further losses.

His friend, Robert, who was a seasoned investor, told him, ""You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap."" John paused, considering the wisdom in Robert's words. Rushing to sell could prevent more potential losses, but it could also rob him of future profits if the shares rebounded. 

""Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound,"" Robert continued. John realized he needed to be patient, to watch the market closely before making any rash decisions. After all, impulsive actions could lead to regret, especially in matters as crucial as financial investments.","A. Amy was well-aware of the ticking clock, yet she was still miles away from completing her assigned homework. As the time continued to slip from her hands, she started to feel a surge of panic. Unable to finish the task on time, she pondered over her possible options. Among her choices was an old cliché: the classic ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. She knew it was a bold lie, her pet was an ageing Labrador, Bailey, who barely had the energy to play fetch, let alone eat her paperwork.

Despite her awareness of how false it sounded, Amy decided to pitch this excuse to her professor. She stood in front of him, putting on an expression of sorrow and disappointment. ""Professor,"" she started, ""my dog ate my homework."" 

However, her professor, a seasoned educator with years of experience, was not convinced. He looked at her through his spectacles and decided to penalize her for not only failing to submit the work on time, but also for attempting to deceive him. Amy learned her lesson that day: excuses, especially the ludicrous ones, seldom save the day.
B. In the bustling corporate office of Dynamic Solutions, Alex was overwhelmed. As a new recruit, he had been taking on as much work as possible to make a good impression. However, his supervisor, Mike, sensed his apprehension and took him aside for a chat. ""Alex,"" Mike said, ""there's no need to take on so much work this quarter.""

Mike's words seemed counterintuitive to Alex, given his ambitious nature. ""Our company policy is a bit different,"" Mike explained, ""the performance this quarter won't significantly impact appraisals. So, don't stretch yourself too thin in your desire to impress.""

Instead, Mike advised Alex to strategically invest more time and effort in the next two quarters. Those were the periods when the management would be actively prioritizing individual contributions. Feeling relieved, Alex thanked his supervisor, promising to heed his advice and manage his workload more strategically in the future.
C. John had been an ambitious and optimistic entrepreneur, always yearning for the most significant breakthrough in his career. He had invested all his energy, time, and resources into launching his new tech startup. This venture, according to him, was his golden ticket to massive success and a life of unending comfort. His faith in the project was absolute, leaving no room for doubt; it was going to be a game-changer, he thought.

He was depending heavily on the success of his venture, seeing it as his only salvation. John had risked everything, from his life savings to important personal relationships. He was so confident that he hadn't thought of any contingency plans. However, his dream came crashing down when the business failed. His venture, which was once filled with promise and potential, was now just a shadow of regret and disappointment. 

The devastating loss led John to financial ruin. He was left with nothing but regret and a significant debt to clear. In retrospect, he realized he had been rash and overconfident. He should have had backup plans and not relied solely on one venture. The harsh reality served as a bitter but much-needed lesson about diversifying risk in business. From then on, he promised to make more calculated decisions and never to throw all his eggs in one basket.
D. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression.

311,It is better to gauge others before taking such political stands these days. You never know who is on your side and who will cause you harm for it.,"In the world of modern politics, it has become increasingly crucial to gauge others before taking firm political stands. This wisdom was something that Charlie, a young political activist, learned the hard way. Charlie was passionate, eager, and had a habit of jumping headfirst into ideological battles without considering the repercussions.

One day, he decided to openly advocate for a controversial policy, believing it was the right thing to do. He was confident that his friends would support him as they had similar views, at least as far as he knew. However, he didn't take into account the fact that not everyone shared his beliefs and passion for political engagement.

When he started receiving backlash from acquaintances and even some close friends, Charlie was taken aback. He couldn't understand why people he thought were allies, were turning against him. The painful realization dawned upon him that not everyone was in his corner, and some were even willing to harm his reputation because of his political stance.

The experience taught him a hard lesson: In the volatile atmosphere of today's politics, it is better to gauge others' thoughts and feelings before taking such political stands. You never know who is on your side and who may cause you harm for it.","A. President Jack Bryan had achieved a level of popularity unmatched by any of his predecessors in his term. His policies had lifted the nation from an economic downturn, his charismatic speeches united a previously divided people, and his transparent leadership earned him unwavering trust. The nation adored him, his approval ratings consistently soaring to incredible heights. However, he was also a firm believer in the power and necessity of democratic processes.

Jack Bryan respected the constitution more than anything, viewing it as the backbone of their nation's democratic values. Despite public clamor for him to serve another term, he was adamant about stepping down at the end of his term. The constitution allowed a president to serve only two consecutive terms, and he had already served his.

As the end of his term approached, his retirement speech became a much-anticipated event. He addressed the nation, thanking them for their support, urging them to maintain unity, and encouraging them to respect the constitutional process. He retired with grace and dignity, cementing his legacy as a president who was not only greatly loved but also deeply respected for upholding the constitution. Despite the nation's wish for him to stay on, they held great respect for his firm stand on constitutional adherence.
B. Sharon and Mark were once a picture-perfect couple, deeply in love, admired by everyone around them for their romantic bond. But, as years passed, life's realities started seeping into their sacred relationship, filling it with misunderstanding, quarrels, and unspoken resentment. The once cheerful conversations were now replaced by uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges. The situation became so dire that they decided to part ways and started preparing for divorce.

One evening while they were sorting through their years of shared memories, they stumbled upon old pictures and love letters they had exchanged in their early days. The memories triggered a strong wave of nostalgia; they found themselves reminiscing about the past and the beautiful moments they had shared. They realized that the problems that seemed immense to them were actually minor obstacles that could be resolved through open conversation and understanding. They decided then and there to give their relationship another shot, to not let years of shared love and companionship go down the drain because of a rough patch.

Since that day, they began working on their issues, nurturing their relationship like a fragile sapling, providing it with the love and care it needed to survive and bloom. The parents have been living happily ever since they decided not to go through the divorce, learning every day that love and understanding always have the power to conquer even the toughest situations.
C. In the quaint village of Welmsley, a rumor persisted that seemed to shroud the old Victorian house at the end of the lane in mystery. People in the village claimed that the house was haunted by the spectral remnants of a lady who lived there many years ago. Gossipmongers regaled tales of her haunting beauty, her tragic love, and her untimely demise, which seemed to have anchored her soul to the earthly confines of the house. 

Upon hearing this, my father hesitated in his plans to buy the property. He decided to postpone his decision, feeling the need to consult others for more opinions about this alarming revelation. Despite my pleas of moving into the picturesque house, he began reaching out to our extended family, fellow churchgoers, and even to paranormal researchers in a desperate quest for insights. 

His exhaustive efforts resulted in a whirlpool of varied perspectives - some scoffed at the suggestion of spectral residents, others encouraged him to seize the deal citing its historical relevance and antique charm. In fact, the paranormal researchers were thrilled by the possibility of a genuine haunting. 

As a week turned into a month, the question of whether to purchase the Victorian house remained unanswered. A veil of uncertainty hung over us as we anxiously awaited my father's ultimate decision - would we become the new occupants of the allegedly haunted house? Only time would tell.
D. In the heart of the warm, comforting living room, a scene of serenity unfolded. A baby was nestled securely in a plush, patchwork blanket, resting peacefully next to her mother. This was not just any blanket; it was a token from her grandmother, each stitched square telling a unique story of family heritage and love. The baby, despite being unaware of the tales woven into the fabric, felt the warmth and safety it radiated. 

She lay there, her tiny fingers curled up around her mother's shirt, her soft breaths rising and falling rhythmically. She was as snug as a bug in a rug, a picture of innocent bliss. Her mother gazed down at her with a love so vast it seemed to fill the room. The soft flicker of the fire casting gentle shadows on their peaceful figures. 

The rest of the world ceased to exist for the pair, their world momentarily reduced to this cocoon of warmth and love. This night was a precious moment etched into the canvas of their lives, a symbol of the unbreakable bond between a mother and her child.",C,"D.

In the bustling corporate office of Dynamic Solutions, Alex was overwhelmed. As a new recruit, he had been taking on as much work as possible to make a good impression. However, his supervisor, Mike, sensed his apprehension and took him aside for a chat. ""Alex,"" Mike said, ""there's no need to take on so much work this quarter.""

Mike's words seemed counterintuitive to Alex, given his ambitious nature. ""Our company policy is a bit different,"" Mike explained, ""the performance this quarter won't significantly impact appraisals. So, don't stretch yourself too thin in your desire to impress.""

Instead, Mike advised Alex to strategically invest more time and effort in the next two quarters. Those were the periods when the management would be actively prioritizing individual contributions. Feeling relieved, Alex thanked his supervisor, promising to heed his advice and manage his workload more strategically in the future.
B. Samantha's relationship with David had been rocky of late. Many late nights and tiffs over trust issues had created a chasm between them. Samantha, at her wit's end, decided to test their bond once more.

She had planned a surprise getaway for them to mend their worn out hearts. But a tempting event arose which had always been on David's bucket list. Samantha had firmly told David about the surprise on the same date as the event, hoping that he would choose their relationship over his individual pursuit.

The day arrived, Samantha packed her bags and hoped for the best. She reached the set destination, her heart pounding heavily against her chest. She held her breath when she saw a figure approaching in the distance. Relief washed over her as she recognised David's features, and she was more than happy when she realised David had kept her trust by not going to the event.
C. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Andy got up from his bed, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He walked over to the window, the chill from the hardwood floor seeping up through his bare feet. With a languid movement, he pushed up the window blinds, the coolness of the metal slats stark against the warmth of his skin.

As the slats slid upward, the inky darkness of his room started yielding to the tentative light of daybreak. Andy stood there for a few moments, absorbing the beauty of the emerging sunrise, his heart filling with a quiet awe. The deep hues of night gradually gave way to vibrant shades of orange and pink, the sun peeking from the eastern horizon with a promise of a new day.

As time lapsed, the canvas of sky turned brighter, the sun now fully emerging in all its glory. The light poured in through the window, filling the room with a warm glow. Everything—the worn-out rug, the wooden desk, the stack of unread books—all looked different, alive even, as they were painted with the hues of the sun. In a matter of few hours, Andy's dark room was transformed, bathed in the morning light, looking as if it had been touched by the hand of an artist.
D. After weeks of hunting for a place to stay, I finally found a modest apartment. The only problem was, I didn't have much furniture. I had managed to scrounge together a few basic items such as a table and chairs, but I was still missing the most essential piece, a bed. 

The first few days passed in discomfort, but I learned to adapt to my circumstances. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now. A couple of thick, fluffy blankets and a firm, supportive pillow helped to make the sofa feel more like a bed. 

In truth, I saw my predicament as an adventure rather than a hardship. I learned to make do with less, and began to appreciate simple comforts. I remembered how important it was to value what I had, rather than yearn for what I lacked. Someday, I knew I would have a bed to call my own, but until that day, the sofa was more than enough.",A,s and the 20s and the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20s the 20 the 20 the 2 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the
313,Gary started investing his money and time in creating a small garden for himself during the off season. Gary regrets not planning and starting during the spring and summer season when results are more visible.,"Gary had always been passionate about nurturing things, which gradually led to a love for gardening. As a professional baseball player, he had little time to indulge in this passion of his during the active seasons. It was during the off season, he decided to invest both his time and money into creating a small garden for himself.

Gary purchased various seeds, gardening tools and started laboring in his backyard, tirelessly. Over time, his backyard began to reflect his hard work. A neat little garden with budding greens started taking shape, bringing him immense joy.

But as the winter months began to roll in, he noticed that his garden was not faring as well as he had imagined. The lack of ample sunlight and warmth was affecting the growth of his plants. It was at that point that Gary felt a pang of regret.

He wished he had started planning and working on his garden during the spring and summer seasons when the plants would have enjoyed optimal conditions for growth. The plants would have been more visible, lush, and healthy. Despite the regret, Gary was not disheartened. He was now better prepared for the next season and eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to enhance his garden.","A. John had always been a cautious man, particularly when it came to his investments. He had a substantial number of shares in a major tech company, shares that he'd held onto for several years. Recently, though, the market had taken a downturn and the value of his shares had plummeted. Panicked, he was on the verge of making a hasty decision to sell all his shares to avoid further losses.

His friend, Robert, who was a seasoned investor, told him, ""You can’t just sell all of your shares when the market is low; look before you leap."" John paused, considering the wisdom in Robert's words. Rushing to sell could prevent more potential losses, but it could also rob him of future profits if the shares rebounded. 

""Tomorrow, it is possible the shares may rebound,"" Robert continued. John realized he needed to be patient, to watch the market closely before making any rash decisions. After all, impulsive actions could lead to regret, especially in matters as crucial as financial investments.
B. Ever since Mary and Amy met in college, they had been inseparable. They shared the same dorm room, same classes, and even the same study schedules. Despite their distinct personalities, they found comfort in their similarities and shared struggles. However, everything changed after one heated argument.

The girls had been studying for their upcoming finals when Amy, stressed and overworked, lost her temper. She berated Mary in a fit of frustration, accusing her of not taking their studies seriously. Mary, taken aback by Amy's outburst, felt hurt by the harsh words. It wasn't just the content, but the tone in which Amy had spoken to her that upset Mary deeply. 

Ever since that incident, Mary stopped talking to Amy. The harshness of Amy's words had stung her deeply, creating a rift that would take time to heal.
C. As a professional in the health field, I've always maintained a stance against smoking. In my perspective, one of the most effective ways to reduce the harmful habit is to show tangible consequences. The mere statutory warning message, like ""smoking is injurious to health,"" lacks the necessary punch to shake off the ignorance in most smokers. Hence, I advocate for placing a picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs, to create a striking visual.

Why a diseased lung, you may ask? Well, the gruesomeness that's depicted in such a picture can leave an indelible impression on the smoker's mind. It's not merely a warning anymore, it's a vivid representation of a possible future outcome of their choices. The smoker, while reaching for a cigarette, will be met with a stark reminder of the implications of his actions. Such a reminder could potentially cultivate a sense of concern and eventually lead to a behavioral change.

It's not just about promoting fear, it's about promoting awareness too. The picture could lead a curious smoker to investigate further into the effects of smoking, hence educating them about the dangers associated with it.
D. Once upon a time, there was a woman named Sara who worked tirelessly in a corporate cubicle day in and day out. She had been in the same position for a decade and the monotonous routine of her job had begun to wear her down. Each day was an exact replica of the previous one with the same old meetings, deadlines, and reports. She felt bored and tired, slowly losing her enthusiasm and zest.

One gloomy Monday, she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen, her heart filling with despair. It was then that she decided she couldn't do it anymore. Sara decided to break free from the chains of her dull job and pursue her passion for cooking. She saved her money and quit her job, leaving the corporate world behind.

She pooled all her resources and took a leap of faith to open up her own restaurant. With love, she chose every detail, from the menu to the decor. Finally, in her own bustling restaurant, she found her happiness and sense of fulfillment she had been longing for.",A,

Ever since we were kids, Jack and I had a friendship that others envied. We grew up next door, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures in our small, quiet town. The bond was genuine, and I believed we'd always be there for each other. However, as we grew older and life became more complex, I noticed a change in Jack's behavior.

Our conversations started becoming one-sided with him ignoring my words and even belittling my opinions. It stung more than I was willing to admit. That was not the Jack I knew and cherished. The Jack I knew was empathetic, understanding, and most importantly, respectful. Thus, I couldn't help but hold it against him for not treating me with respect.

In response, I distanced myself, feeling betrayed and upset. I missed our old friendship, but I couldn't overlook his disrespectful behavior. With time, I managed to accept the change, holding onto the memories of our past and hoping that one day, the Jack I once knew would return.
B. The candle had been burning for hours, casting a warm glow across the room, but now its life was ending. As the flame extinguished, it left behind a thin wisp of smoke. The smoke twirled and danced gracefully in the air, a subtle performance of nature, before slowly beginning to dissipate.

To John, who was quietly sitting across the room, this sequence of events felt oddly symbolic. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life - how something so beautiful and vibrant could just vanish in an instant, leaving behind a mere ghost of its existence. 

His mind traveled back to the year his mother had passed away. A once vivacious woman, her flame had too been dimmed by the cruel hands of cancer, leaving behind only memories - ephemeral wisp of smoke to grasp. 

He leaned back, closing his eyes, allowing himself to dive into the deeper depths of his thoughts, feeling the loss once again. He didn't know how long he sat there, lost in his thoughts, but when he opened his eyes again, the wisp of smoke had completely disappeared. The room was now submerged in darkness, the extinguished candle serving as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life.

D. Once a highly reputed multinational company decided to collaborate with a promising startup. The startup was headed by a charismatic man who went by the title of CEO. This CEO was a young, dynamic man, full of charm and intelligence, he promised to bring fresh and innovative ideas to the collaboration. His persuasive speeches and highly ambitious goals attracted everyone. All were fascinated by his remarkable persona. 

The deal was signed amidst great fanfare, with hopes of groundbreaking success. However, as months passed, the progress of the joint venture was not as expected. The so-called innovative ideas proved to be unworkable in practical terms. The charming so-called CEO's assurances turned out to be nothing more than empty words.

315,Samantha should not spend all her savings on the flight tickets during the holidays. She should wait and check after a few months when the prices are low.,"Samantha had always been a frugal young woman. The amount she had in her savings account was the result of years of careful spending and diligent saving. It was a security blanket, a nest egg for future endeavors, and possibly emergencies. And, like many young people, she dreamed of traveling.

When the holidays approached, she was tempted to splurge on expensive flight tickets to exotic destinations. Seeing her friends post pictures of their vacations made her eager to escape her monotonous routine. Yet, something told her to wait, to resist the impulse and consider the repercussions. 

Samantha decided to hold off on her travel plans, reminding herself that patience was a virtue. She figured it was better to wait a few months when the rush of holiday travelers would die down, and prices would drop. By then, she would still have a substantial amount left in her savings after purchasing a ticket, and could even have extra money for her trip. In this way, Samantha was ensuring that she would not only have a memorable trip but also a financially secure future.","A. Eli had always been a firm believer in holding a steady job and making a dependable living. He'd always say, ""You may not like your job, but don't quit merely on the hope of finding a better one."" His co-worker, Phil, was not of the same mindset. Working in a dull grey cubicle had sapped the life out of him and Phil longed for a more exciting career. 

One day, he came across a tempting job ad, promising a dynamic work environment and a hefty pay. Tantalized by the prospect of escape, he gave his resignation the very next day, burning his bridge with his reliable, though monotonous job. However, as the days turned into weeks, Phil's dream job remained a distant hope. 

The dynamic work environment proved to be too strenuous and the hefty pay turned out to be a mere bait. As the reality sank in, Phil finally understood the wisdom in Eli's words. He realized that he had not merely quit his job but had forsaken his safety net on a hope that turned out to be nothing more than an illusion.

C. Curiosity was evident in young Annie's eyes as she watched the televised speech, her head slightly tilted. She asked her grandmother, seated beside her, ""Who is that man speaking so boldly, Grandma?"" Smiling, her grandmother replied, ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!""

Annie's eyes widened, clearly awed by the information. The idea that this ordinary-looking man was the leader of their country was a novel concept to her young mind. ""But he looks like our next-door neighbor, Mr. Johnson,"" she exclaimed, a hint of disbelief coloring her tone.

Her grandmother chuckled, a soft sound echoing within the quiet living room. ""Yes, darling,"" she said, patting Annie's head gently. ""That's the beauty of democracy. Anyone, even our neighbor Mr. Johnson, could one day become the president."" The room fell silent again, except for the president's speech, as Annie sat there, immersed in her newfound realization, contemplating the vast possibilities of life.
D. Victor always believed that actors simply got paid for doing practically nothing. In his eyes, acting was a trivial pursuit, devoid of complexity or depth. After all, it was just pretending to be someone else, nothing more. However, everything changed when he decided to join a local theater class on a whim. 

On his first day in class, Victor quickly realised he was out of his depth. The passion his classmates exhibited was palpitous and the seriousness with which they approached their roles took him aback. Not only did acting demand physical stamina, but it also required immense emotional intelligence and empathetic finesse. 

Then came his turn to perform. The stage seemed to loom above him as he struggled to remember his lines and movements. Each word he spoke, every movement he made felt awkward and artificial. He could feel a disconnection between himself and the character he was supposed to portray, the narrative he was to weave. It was in that moment Victor understood that acting wasn’t as easy or as useless as he had originally thought. It was a craft that demanded hard work, dedication, and an ability to immerse oneself in another world. Not everyone had the capacity to master this art form and he held newfound respect for those who could.",B,

My heart pounded nervously while sweat trickled down my forehead. The proposal laid out before us represented the culmination of months of hard work, and it needed to succeed. The opposing party, a group of stern-faced businessmen, scrutinized every detail, challenging us at every turn. 

One moment they'd lean back, appearing disinterested, and the next moment they'd snap forward, blasting us with another onslaught of demands. Many times, it seemed like the deal would slip away. We huddled together, discussing counteroffers and strategies in hushed whispers while clutching at our lukewarm coffee cups for comfort. 

Hours of negotiations stretched into days, with the outcome looking grim. However, just as we thought we had lost, we managed to reach a compromise on their final condition. The deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations, leaving us with a sense of accomplishment and relief that was worth every stressful moment.","A. ""We're in for a penny, in for a pound,"" Alex said, looking at his weary-eyed team. They all stared back at him, their faces fatigued after hours of hard work. The enormity of the project they had undertaken was sinking in. There were piles of data still to be analyzed, charts to be made, and sections to be written. 

""We need to stay up all night and get the report done since we cannot turn it in half-finished,"" he continued. There were murmurs of agreement around the room. Emma, a talented analyst, but also a single mother, sighed in resignation. She looked at her watch, calculating the time she had left before her son would wake up needing her. 

Alex looked at his team, admiration mixed with guilt in his eyes. ""It's going to be a long night,"" he murmured, buckling down for the marathon of work ahead.
B. The local soccer match had been in progress for the better part of two hours and had been a thrilling spectacle from the get-go. The two teams, evenly matched, were engaged in a fierce duel for supremacy. Both had managed to net two goals each, creating an electric atmosphere in the stadium. The roaring crowd was on edge, waiting for the decisive moment that would tilt the balance.

Then, in the 87th minute, it happened. The home team's star forward, known for his swift agility and strategic dribbling, outpaced his rivals and ran toward the opponent's goal post. The opposition's goalkeeper was alert, eyes trained on every movement of the forward.

Despite his best efforts, the forward managed to artfully maneuver the ball around him, driving it toward the far post. The moment froze as everyone watched the ball soar through the air and nestle into the net. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal, causing an eruption of euphoria among the home team's supporters.
C. I had always known Miranda to be a crafty girl, but it wasn't until we were paired up for a history project that I saw just how sneaky she could be. The project was to create a detailed timeline on the events of the Revolutionary War, clearly not an easy task. We agreed to share the work equally, to make the workload lighter for both of us. However, I soon noticed Miranda's work ethic didn't quite match mine.

One day, while we were brainstorming in the library, Miranda suggested we divide the tasks. To my surprise, she offered to take over the easy part, compiling the list of dates and events. She then suggested I take up the responsibility of researching each event in depth, crafting detailed descriptions, and designing the physical timeline; the hardest part of the assignment.

Miranda said it so sweetly, with a harmless smile and an innocent tilt of her head. But I immediately saw through her. She was trying to hand over the hardest part of the assignment to me so she doesn't have to do it. Realizing her cunning intentions, I decided to negotiate the division of tasks more fairly, refusing to let her escape her fair share of the work.
D. Linda had always been a reserved woman, with her emotions often kept in check and concealed beneath a cordial smile. However, she was different in her own home, especially when she was around her husband, Tom. Linda's demeanor changes whenever her husband is around; her stiff exterior softens, her subtle smile widens, and her eyes brighten.

She becomes a completely different person, a version of her that only Tom gets to witness. Linda's inhibitions dissipate, and she laughs freely, her laughter ringing through their home. She allows her quirky sense of humor to shine through, delighting Tom with her unexpected witticisms.

With him, she indulges in silly pranks, playful banter, and unfiltered conversations, revealing her carefree side. She feels she can be her true self whenever she's with him, a luxury she doesn't allow herself in the presence of others. It is in these moments, with Tom by her side, that Linda truly finds her sanctuary, a space where she can unabashedly be herself. Indeed, to Linda, Tom is more than her husband; he is the key to her freedom, her happiness, and her authenticity.",B,

My project partner, Sam, and I were given an assignment to design a model of a suspension bridge. However, as the deadline approached, Sam caught the flu.

His illness was severe and he was advised strict bed rest for two weeks. If my project partner hadn't gotten sick, I would have never needed to undertake the herculean task of finishing the entire assignment on my own. But life had other plans.

The challenge was monumental, but I took it head on. I submerged myself into work, spending day and night studying, designing, and creating the model. With a lot of determination and some cups of strong coffee, I was able to complete the assignment single-handedly and deliver it on time. I learnt a valuable lesson on persistence and self-reliance through this incident.
B. I had been telling you for weeks, constantly pestering you to go see a doctor. But you were stubborn, choosing to ignore the persistent cough that seemed to grow worse with each passing day. I hated how you always pushed away concerns about your health, your dismissive attitude was infuriating. You continued to tell me it was nothing more than a seasonal cold, that it would pass.

One day, we woke up to the alarming sound of you gasping for breath, unable to stand on your own. We rushed to the hospital where the doctors hooked you to machines. The sterile smell of the hospital, the muffled sounds of patients and the constant beep of monitors filled the air. 

A grim looking doctor entered the room, removing his spectacles as he prepared to deliver the news. He looked at you and said, ""You should have gone to the doctor earlier."" His voice carried a tone of regret and guilt, ""They still could have cured you then."" Your stubbornness had let a simple cold progress into pneumonia that was now threatening your life.
C. Ever since childhood, the darkness has always held a certain ominous quality for me, eliciting a gripping fear deep within. So, naturally, the idea of wandering the empty streets at night is petrifying. I've always had a vivid imagination and I could see shadows morph into monstrous figures, hear the wind whisper eerie tales, and sense the unseen danger lurking around. Yet, I know that living independently is in my future and it means eventually overcoming this fear.

Soon, my days will not end with family dinners or movie nights with roommates. They will conclude with my return to a silent home, a home solely occupied by me. The walk from my office to the apartment will inevitably involve me crossing several streets, eerily quiet and dimly lit at night. These will be my streets, the path that will lead me back home, and hence, I will need to conquer my fear to inhabit them.

As the days roll into weeks, I will muster courage and adapt. I will not just live with my fear of walking on the streets at night but will overcome it. My heart pounding in my chest will slowly become a normal rhythm, my fear will turn into a certain caution, and my journey, a routine I follow, unfazed. The darkness won't be a cause for terror anymore. Instead, the quiet streets will make me feel independent and strong.
D. The atmosphere was tense as we walked into the boardroom, ready for the negotiations to begin. My heart pounded nervously while sweat trickled down my forehead. The proposal laid out before us represented the culmination of months of hard work, and it needed to succeed. The opposing party, a group of stern-faced businessmen, scrutinized every detail, challenging us at every turn. 

One moment they'd lean back, appearing disinterested, and the next moment they'd snap forward, blasting us with another onslaught of demands. Many times, it seemed like the deal would slip away. We huddled together, discussing counteroffers and strategies in hushed whispers while clutching at our lukewarm coffee cups for comfort. 

Hours of negotiations stretched into days, with the outcome looking grim. However, just as we thought we had lost, we managed to reach a compromise on their final condition. The deal was finally in the bag after a few rounds of tough negotiations, leaving us with a sense of accomplishment and relief that was worth every stressful moment.",D,"s 202018

318,"After months of hard campaigning, the politician had all but secured the election.","After months of grueling hard work, countless rallies, speeches, and debates, a sense of relief enveloped the politician. He had all but secured the election. The numbers were on his side and the public had warmed up to him. 

He started his campaign as a dark horse. His opponents were well-known figures in politics. They underestimated his power, seeing him as little more than a nuisance. But, his constant perseverance and the distinct integrity he possessed caught the public's attention.

The tide began to turn halfway through the campaign. His popularity soared after a powerful speech about the importance of honesty and transparency in politics. He spoke sincerely, without any hidden agenda, making sure his words reached the heart of the common man. 

His campaign team worked tirelessly to make him a prominent figure in the political landscape. The intense campaigning paid off; it was clear the politician had won over the public. The election night was expected to be a mere formality, marking the beginning of his term in the office. He felt content and hopeful about his future as a leader, grateful that his months of relentless campaigning had not been in vain.","A. The local soccer match had been in progress for the better part of two hours and had been a thrilling spectacle from the get-go. The two teams, evenly matched, were engaged in a fierce duel for supremacy. Both had managed to net two goals each, creating an electric atmosphere in the stadium. The roaring crowd was on edge, waiting for the decisive moment that would tilt the balance.

Then, in the 87th minute, it happened. The home team's star forward, known for his swift agility and strategic dribbling, outpaced his rivals and ran toward the opponent's goal post. The opposition's goalkeeper was alert, eyes trained on every movement of the forward.

Despite his best efforts, the forward managed to artfully maneuver the ball around him, driving it toward the far post. The moment froze as everyone watched the ball soar through the air and nestle into the net. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal, causing an eruption of euphoria among the home team's supporters.
B. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, with her constantly changing hair color and an inexplicable love for oversized, flashy accessories, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met. Her quirky appearance always manages to take people by surprise when she voices her thoughts. We first crossed paths at a local café, where Lexi was wearing a sunflower crown and sporting a bright blue hair. I remember overhearing her conversation with the elderly man at the next table, about the geopolitical ramifications of a recent election.

Even though her flashy appearance said otherwise, her intellect and insight were evident in her every word. Lexi's wisdom extends beyond politics. She can, in one moment, discuss the finer points of classical literature, then easily switch to explaining the complexities of quantum physics or debating the abstract philosophies of life. 

Being around her, I began to understand the depth of her knowledge and the breadth of her understanding. It was a lesson to not judge someone by their appearance, because here was Lexi, vibrant and quirky, yet full of wisdom that could put the wisest of scholars to shame. Despite her exterior portraying her as an airhead, Lexi has, and continues to be, a paragon of wisdom and intellect to me.
C. Garry was always the first to arrive at work, and often the last to leave. He prided himself on his work ethic, his commitment to his team, and his ability to handle high-stress situations. At the office, whenever his colleagues complained about the burden of work and asked him how he managed, Garry would simply flash them an easy grin and say, ""It's all about taking one thing at a time.""

However, there was a different story that unfolded outside the office. His colleagues often noticed his constant need for smoke breaks. Every hour, without fail, Garry would head down to the small patch of grass behind the building and light up. It was as if he was battling an invisible enemy, each puff a blow to the stress that kept piling up.

Yet, he never admitted it. Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress, but his constant need for smoking told a different story. The cigarette smoke, spiralling into the sky, bore silent testimony to the battles that Garry fought alone, far from the eyes of his colleagues. In reality, Garry was just as stressed as any of them - it was just that his stress took the form of ash and smoke.
D. John had always loved a good challenge and what better one to undertake than running a marathon. It was a goal he had set for himself after successfully overcoming a health hurdle. Several weeks were spent tirelessly in preparation, pushing his body to the brink every single day. Early morning jogs turned into late afternoon sprints as John trained, fueled by an inexhaustible determination.

The day of the marathon arrived, crisp and clear. Excitement mixed with anxiety buzzed through the air as John took his place at the start line. The race was gruelling; he could feel every muscle burning as he pushed through the pain, refusing to give in. His breathing became labored, the ribbon marking the finish line a mere blur in his vision. 

With a final surge of strength, John crossed the finish line. Overwhelmed by the combination of relief, exhaustion, and elation, he collapsed after he ran for the marathon.",A,s are a great.

319,The job was finally his after the last interview that went well.,"For months, Jason had been applying to jobs without any luck. Each passing day saw him growing more dejected, the constant rejections dampening his spirit. However, his gloom didn't last forever. One day, he received a call for an interview at a prestigious company he had always dreamed of working for. 

Despite his initial apprehension, Jason prepared extensively for this job interview. After countless hours of practice and rehearsal, the day of the interview finally came. Nervously he walked into the office building, took a deep breath, and gave the interview his absolute best. The HR manager seemed impressed with his knowledge and experience in the field. 

A few agonising days later, he received an email from the company extending an offer of employment. The job was finally his after the last interview that went well, marking an end to his prolonged job search and igniting a new beginning in his professional journey.","A. As the team leader for an advertising agency, I had always valued the contribution of each member. Hence, when one of my subordinates, Mike, came to me requesting early vacation, I was initially tempted to agree. Mike had always been hardworking and it seemed fair to let him have his break. However, there was one issue. Mike had not yet presented his work on our current project for review.

I looked at him, sighed deeply, and said, ""I am sorry, but you would now have to present your work before you can go for the vacation."" His face fell as he realized the impending delay in his plans. 

I explained to him that we needed his report to move forward with the project and that his break could be detrimental to our progress. Mike understood, nodded, and agreed to work on his presentation immediately. While I wished I could have granted his request immediately, I knew the hard truth of our profession: our work had to come first before personal pursuits.
B. Sally, a woman known for her relentless work ethic, spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. Her sister, Lucy, often advocated for a more balanced lifestyle, insisting that taking time for oneself was crucial for overall well-being. After constant pleas from Lucy, Sally finally decided to give it a shot.

Saturday morning started off well; Sally had a lie-in, followed by a leisurely breakfast. She then spent the afternoon reading a book on the porch, basking in the warm sunlight. Meanwhile, her sister Lucy was content, seeing Sally finally taking a break from her otherwise non-stop routine.

Sunday followed a similar rhythm; Sally lazed around, occasionally scribbling in her journal or taking leisurely strolls in the park. She was admittedly enjoying the downtime and felt a sense of calmness she hadn't experienced in a while.

However, as Monday loomed closer, Sally realized the error in her decision. She had a ton of work pending, assignments to be submitted, and meetings to prepare for. In retrospect, Sally understood that while relaxation was important, she needed to find a way to balance it with her heavy workload. She realized that she had perhaps overindulged in relaxation, pushing her work commitments to the brink of chaos.
C. Once upon a time, Mark and John were neighbors who didn't get along very well. They would have frequent disputes over minor things like their dogs or the line of property, causing much tension between them. One rainy day, John's basement was flooded, leaving his family in a state of distress.

Mark, seeing their predicament, decided to put their differences aside and offer a helping hand. Despite their past quarrels, he offered his basement for their temporary use until theirs was repaired. John, though surprised by this generous offer, accepted it graciously. 

This unexpected act of kindness broke the ice between them and they started interacting more, eventually realizing how trivial their past issues were. They both chuckled over their previous arguments, understanding how senseless their hostility was. So one day, as they stood in the backyard, Mark smiled and said to John, ""Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.""

From that day onward, they didn't just share a boundary wall, but a great friendship too, showing how adversity could sometimes bring out the best in people.

320,"Everyone thought that he would lose, but he made a comeback through herculean effort.","Everyone in the small, tight-knit community thought that he would lose. Daniel had always been a dreamer, but his aspiration to win the annual Tri-County Marathon seemed an impossible task. After all, he had never attempted any such thing before. Furthermore, the formidable Harry Wilson, with his track record of consecutive wins, was participating this year too.

Nobody, except Daniel, thought that he stood a chance. But Daniel was determined to prove them wrong. He spent hours every day training, pushing his body to its absolute limits. He endured every muscle cramp, every stitch in his side, and every moment of exhaustion, with a spirit that could only be described as herculean.

Finally, the marathon day arrived. Everyone watched in astonishment as Daniel not only finished, but also surpassed the undefeatable Harry Wilson. Despite the disbelief of the entire town, he had managed to stage an extraordinary comeback through his herculean effort and won the race, proving to everyone that even the impossible can be made possible with unyielding determination.","A. Ralph has always been a detail-oriented person, but this current project of ours seemed to magnify this trait to an annoying level. We bought this old, dilapidated house on the countryside with the intention of renovating it completely. It was a huge project that required the utmost attention to every room, every nook and cranny. Despite the enormity of the task, his attention was bizarrely drawn to one particular doorknob.

This was not an ordinary doorknob, but an antique, rusted one which was hanging onto the main entrance door of our project house. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture. It confounds me how he can lose himself in the intricacies of the tarnished brass detail while ignoring the bigger tasks at hand. 

Rooms needed painting, floorboards needed replacing, and the roof definitely needed some serious work. Yet here was Ralph, consumed with researching how to restore a singular, century-old doorknob. It was a testament to his tendency to get lost in the minute details and lose sight of the larger goal, a flaw that could potentially derail our entire renovation plan.
B. Every time I open the book in an attempt to glean knowledge from its pages, my mind wanders. The way the book is written seems so alien, so far removed from the linguistic norms I'm accustomed to that it pulls me out of the story. The peculiar grammar structures and unfamiliar word choice consistently interrupt my train of thought, making it nearly impossible for me to absorb the content. It's frustrating because the author appears to have unique ideas worth exploring. 

Each sentence appears like a labyrinth, full of twists and turns created by this bizarre language usage. I start to read, but then get lost in the mire of unorthodox punctuation and unusual syntax. My focus shifts from trying to understand the author's thoughts to simply attempting to decipher the language. 

I feel robbed of the wisdom that could potentially be hidden in the book’s pages, hidden behind the strange wording. As much as I would love to appreciate the potential depth of the book, the continuous distraction makes learning anything from it a great challenge. I've come to realize that no matter how compelling the ideas, if one can't communicate them effectively, their value diminishes.

D. The young boy, sitting at his wooden desk, picked up his grandfather's old fountain pen. It was a relic from a different time, with intricate designs etched into the cool metal. He'd been told stories about how his grandfather wrote beautiful letters to his grandmother using this very pen, their love story encapsulated in its eloquent strokes. It was now his turn to express his feelings and weave them into words for the girl he secretly admired. However, with a crestfallen expression, he quickly discovered a significant problem: the pen was out of ink.

""No ink?"" he muttered to himself, ""You can't write from an inkless pen."" A wave of disappointment washed over him. His mind raced, trying to figure out where he could find more ink at this late hour. Ultimately, he decided he wouldn't let this setback stop him. He would simply write his emotions through another means, imbued with the same sincerity and passion that his grandfather's old fountain pen held.",C,"#1 New York Times Crossword Puzzle is a fun and engaging, but it can also be a great way to improve your vocabulary, speling, and grammer.

Max, my pet dog, is an energetic and playful soul. He has a great fondness for games, with his favorite being frisbee. Our routine was the same every day; as soon as I would get back from work, we would head straight to the park. This park, just a few blocks away, was Max's paradise.

Today was no different; we spent the whole day running around, chasing and tossing the frisbee under the warm sun. Max was the star of the park, darting around like a whirlwind with his bright red frisbee. He would leap into the air, trying to snatch the frisbee before it touched the ground, displaying his athleticism and enthusiasm.

As the sun began to set, we started our walk back home. The whole day of energetic play was evident on Max; he was panting hard but had an unmistakable gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Now, after a long day full of fun and games, my pet dog Max is down for the count, snoring softly in his corner, probably dreaming about another day full of frisbee fun.
B. Larry, a young entrepreneur, had always had a keen eye for good real estate deals. Back in the day, he had come across a vast piece of land, nestled amid verdant woods and just discovered by developers. It was undeveloped, untouched, a blank canvas ready to be painted on. Recognizing the potential it had for future growth and appreciation, Larry decided to purchase the plot to build a home on it. At the time, the price was rock-bottom due to its lack of amenities and infrastructure.

He built his dream home on that very plot and watched as over the years, the area started developing around him. Slowly but surely, what was once a remote and neglected piece of land became a thriving hub for the city's upper echelon.

As time flew by, the value of the property skyrocketed. Now, his stunning home was perched in one of the city’s most affluent districts. It was now so expensive, that even his wealthy friend Will, known for his deep pockets and expensive taste, could not afford to buy it. Larry's keen foresight had paid off, leaving him with not just a house, but a treasure trove.
C. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.

He was the eldest son, intelligent and charming, the pride and joy of the family. Despite his good qualities, however, Olive had a rebellious streak that became evident as he grew older.

Things started to get complicated when he fell in love with a young woman from the same town. Olive's family was thrilled when they got engaged, envisioning a grand wedding that would further elevate their social status. Plans were made, invites were sent, and the whole town was abuzz with anticipation for the extravagant event.

Shock and scandal ensued, however, when Olive suddenly vanished only a week before the wedding. It was later discovered that he had run away with a traveling artist, someone he had secretly been seeing for months. It felt like an unexpected slap in the face for his family and fiancé, his actions creating a ripple of embarrassment and disappointment that stretched far beyond their small community.

After that, no one in the family spoke about Olive anymore. Over time, he became the ""black sheep,"" the name that was avoided in conversations, the son who had stained their good name. Despite the love they once had for him, Olive's actions had ultimately led to his exclusion from the family.","A. John was always one to take risks. His adrenaline-pumping adventures ranged from skydiving to deep-sea diving. Yet, the most thrilling adventure for him was the stock market. The ups and downs, the unpredictability of it, intrigued him. 

One day, he got a windfall, inheriting a hefty sum from a long-lost relative. Excited and eager to increase this amount, he decided to invest it all in the stock market. His friend, Robert, a seasoned investor, cautioned him. ""Don’t invest all your money in the stock market,"" Robert warned. ""Diversify your investments, John,"" he added, ""You should never put all your eggs in one basket."" John took the advice to heart, and rather than rushing into one venture, he wisely decided to spread his investments, realizing the importance of not betting everything on a single possibility.
B. Laura was a budding indie artist, preparing to release her much-anticipated debut album. She had spent countless hours crafting the perfect melodies and lyrics, pouring her heart and soul into each song. Critics and fans alike were waiting with bated breath, convinced that Laura's album would be nothing short of a masterpiece.

The album was a collection of fourteen songs, each one a poignant story, a tiny fragment of Laura's life converted into beautiful melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The first thirteen songs were nothing short of spectacular. They resonated with the listeners, reverberating with the collective human experiences of love, loss, and healing. Every note, every strum, and every beat filled the air with an irrefutable magic, making the audience sway and sing along.

But when the last song played, a distinct discomfort filled the room. It was an upbeat pop song, a stark contrast from the beautiful melancholic tunes that characterized the rest of the album. It felt out of place and jarring, breaking the emotive spell the album had cast. All the songs on her album were amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.
C. John had been working as a software engineer for nearly a decade and developed a knack for understanding and fixing technical glitches. Because of his expertise, friends often approached him with their tech problems. One day, his friend, Lisa, approached him with a desperate expression on her face. Her laptop, which contained all her work and personal data, was refusing to boot up.

""If you had come earlier with your computer,"" John told her regretfully, ""it would have been possible to fix the malfunction."" He explained that the problem was a corrupt operating system. If it had been caught early on, he could have potentially restored the system or saved her data. However, the damage was now too extensive, and the system irreparable.

""But now, you may need to buy a new one,"" he suggested, noting her shocked expression. Although it was unfortunate news, John hoped that next time, Lisa would seek help immediately upon noticing an issue to avoid such a disastrous situation.
D. In the heart of a bustling diner, David, the incharge, was managing the chaos of the rush hour. David was a stern man, a stickler for cleanliness who loved order in his diner. Lately, he had been grappling with the recurring issue of a slippery floor. 

Just a week ago, a new hire, a young man named Jake, had joined their small team. Jake, like a breath of fresh air, brought a refreshing dedication to the monotonous tasks. He took David’s concerns about the slippery floor seriously and promised to remedy it. 

Today, as David walked around inspecting the diner, he couldn't help but notice the sparkly clean floor. His shoes made no squeaking noise, and he felt no slip under his soles. The stern lines on David's face dissolved into a broad smile, filling him with overjoying pride for his new hire. The floor had finally been cleaned properly and was no longer a potential hazard to anyone.",B,"2017th of March 2017

323,Sandy is the only one who doesn't show up to the dance class and one of us is always without a partner because of it.,"Every Wednesday evening, our small community center transforms into a vibrant dance studio. Friends and neighbors, young and old, come together to learn Salsa under the guidance of Miss Brenda, the dance instructor who owns a heart as lively as her dance steps. Everyone, except for Sandy. Sandy is the only one who doesn't show up to the dance class.

Her absence isn't unnoticed, we are always an uneven group and due to her consistent absence, one of us is always without a partner. Last Wednesday, it was Bill who stood alone, looking quite awkward. The week before, it was sweet old Mrs. McKinley, who bravely chose to dance by herself rather than miss out on the fun. It had even been me, once or twice, left standing alone when the rhythm of salsa filled the air. 

In fact, her chronic absence has turned into our own little joke, 'Who's going to be the Sandy-less one this week?'. It's all in good fun, but we can't help but wish that one day, Sandy will surprise us all, walk through that door, and no one will be left without a partner again.","A. At the prestigious Bellington University, a group of four science students were assigned a complex project that was to be presented in front of the entire class. Two weeks before the presentation, one member of the team, Jason, received news that his grandmother was critically ill. Despite his personal issues, Jason continued to contribute to the project to the best of his abilities. To ease Jason's stress, the group decided to concoct a small lie, stating that Jason was out of town visiting ailing relatives. They hoped this would exempt them from the presentation, allowing them to simply turn in the paper instead.

On the day of the meeting, one of the group members casually informed their professor, Dr. Sanders, about Jason's unexpected absence. However, Dr. Sanders, with his years of experience and knack for reading his students, discerned the fib. Coincidentally, he had seen Jason at the library earlier that day, working on the project. With the truth in sight, Dr. Sanders decided not to confront the group about their deception. Instead, he made the choice to deduct marks on their project, teaching them a valuable lesson about honesty and integrity in academia.
B. Growing up, Jim was like the black sheep among us, a tightly knit group of six. He stood out, not only because of his wild and untamed nature but also because he is the only one from our group who has engaged in any sort of criminal activity. The rest of us were content living our routine, law-abiding lives.

The pinnacle of his misadventures happened during the peak of his teenage rebellion years. Jim was caught for possession of illegal substances and had to serve time in jail. Only Jim has ever spent time behind bars. The sight of our formerly reckless and energetic friend in that orange jumpsuit sent waves of shock through all of us.

After all, before that, our experiences with the law were limited to minor traffic violations. But that sobering period forced us to realize that we weren't invincible adolescents anymore. Today, Jim's story serves as a stark reminder of the severe consequences of bad choices, adding a somber tone to our shared history. Despite it all, we have remained a close-knit group, supporting each other through the best and worst of times.
C. Upon entering the room, I caught sight of you dancing ecstatically, waving a piece of paper in the air. It was evident in your twinkling eyes and flushed cheeks, something wonderful had occurred. I approached you, barely holding back a smile, curious about what had ignited such jubilation. 

You turned to me, out of breath but gleaming with happiness, holding out the letter that you had been clutching so tightly. I read the letter; it was a job offer from your dream company. “I can see that you are beside yourself with joy at being selected for the job,” I exclaimed with a chuckle. 

I pulled you into a warm hug, congratulating you heartily. It was a moment of genuine bliss, your relentless hard work and dedication had finally paid off. All your sleepless nights, the times of self-doubt, the perseverance, everything had culminated in this one triumphant moment. As I let you go, I saw a new spark in your eyes; you were ready to embark on this new journey, ready to make your mark on the world. 

Congratulations, my friend. Your victory was well-deserved.
D. When some people see my Instagram feed, the beautiful snapshots of foreign landscapes and exotic food, they always say, ""It looks like fun."" And yes, there are moments that are incredibly exciting and fulfilling. But there's an untold reality to this adventurous facade that often gets overlooked. In reality, it is a struggle to move to a different country. 

It’s not just about adjusting to the new scenery or getting lost in translation. It's the deep-rooted homesickness that never seems to go away. It's missing your family's comfort, your friends' laughter, and the familiarity of your home. It’s the feeling of alienation while trying to fit in a culture so different from your own. 

So while you may look at my life and see an unending vacation, remember to count your blessings. The stability, comfort, and sense of belonging that comes with being home is a privilege not everyone enjoys. Cherishing that is more important than any far-flung adventure.",B,"#1.

Larry had always idolized Frank, a self-made millionaire who owned one of the most successful startups in the city. Ever since Larry had attended a seminar Frank spoke at about entrepreneurship, he had felt an inexplicable connection with him. It wasn't just Frank's success that intrigued Larry, it was his outlook towards life, business ethics and transparency, and the way he carried himself. For Larry, Frank wasn't just a successful entrepreneur; he was a mentor, a role model.

Larry was so attached to the idea of working for Frank that no other employer could convince him otherwise. He had several lucrative offers from other employers who were impressed by his skills and potential, but he declined them all. He was a man on a mission, determined to become part of Frank’s company, irrespective of the role he had to take up.

He reached out to Frank multiple times, explaining his passion, but never received a response. Larry, however, was not disheartened. He persisted, continually improving his skills and hoping that someday, he would get the opportunity to work with his idol, unswayed by the tempting offers that could have led him down a different path.
B. My sister, Emily, has a deeply ingrained fear of the dark that traces back to our childhood. As children, we would share ghost stories late at night, and Emily would always end up shaken, her imagination running wild. She was so petrified that she always left the hallway light on before going to sleep, casting a faint glow into her room. It was her way of dealing with the fear of what lurked in the darkness. 

But as we grew older, Emily decided that she could no longer allow her fear to dictate her life. She often spoke of her desire to one day sleep in a completely dark room, without the safety of the light from the hallway. It was a small step, but to her, it was a challenge that signified growth and bravery. 

Every night, she would push her boundaries, dimming the hallway light just a bit more than the previous night. She'd often wake up in the middle of the night, her fears creeping back in, but would force herself back to sleep. It was a slow process, but Emily was determined to conquer her fear, challenge herself, and someday, sleep peacefully in a dark room.
C. Every morning, I have a steadfast routine of strolling into the downtown cafe for my daily fix of caffeine. It's an indulgence I've always allowed myself, rationalizing that it's a small expense for such a big pleasure. A double-shot of espresso to start my day, a late morning latte, an afternoon cappuccino; coffee was my fuel, my lifeline. 

I never really thought about my tiny daily coffee expenses until I began to audit my finances. As a freelance graphic designer, my income was wildly inconsistent, but the expense for my coffee never faltered. When I sat down to pour over my bank statement, I was floored. The daily $5 here and $4 there had accumulated over the month into a sizable portion of my income. 

Staring at the numbers, I felt a knot in my stomach. I realized that my beloved coffee habit was draining up all my income. The decision was difficult, but inevitable; the time had come to invest in a coffee machine at home and drastically cut down on my cafe visits.
D. The A team was known throughout the league as the undeniable powerhouse, the top dog. It boasted of players who could dribble with finesse, shoot with pinpoint accuracy, and defend with relentless intensity. The swift and deadly forwards were matched by the relentless backfield, each player a vital piece in a well-oiled machine. There was Johnny, the swift point guard, and Billy, the towering center, both indispensable members of the team. With them leading the way, their opponents were often left awestruck.

However, there was one player who stood out for all the wrong reasons. His name was Ron. Despite possessing the physical attributes of a great player, Ron had a knack for making poor decisions at crucial moments in the game. He would frequently lose focus, his mind drifting off during team strategies, and he seemed utterly oblivious to the damage he was causing.

His lack of discipline and teamwork often undermined the combined efforts of the team, leading to crucial losses. The other players were growing frustrated with his irresponsible attitude.

325,"Everyone likes me because I'm so quiet and obedient. The same cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan, who always lands himself in trouble.","Everyone seems to appreciate me because I'm so quiet and obedient. I always listen to instructions, never break the rules, and most of all, I avoid causing any kind of disturbance. I blend into the background so effortlessly, always keen to avoid any sort of negative attention. People admire my docility and often praise me for my politeness.

However, the same simply cannot be said for my wild cousin Nathan. Nathan is different, a polar opposite of me. He's a rebellious spirit, a live wire, always in search of the next thrilling adventure. Rules, to him, are merely suggestions that are made to be broken. Nathan does not know how to keep his voice down or sit still, his exuberance always getting the better of him.

This trait of his, though exciting, inevitably lands him in all sorts of trouble, from playground feuds to detention in school. His mischief is notorious, making him infamous among his peers and teachers alike. To the world, we are two sides of the same coin, a study in contrast, but deep down, we are just two boys learning to navigate life in our unique ways.","A. Garry is a content and humble man. He is employed at a local grocery store where he works diligently. Despite knowing he is underpaid compared to others in similar positions, Garry is not a man of many demands. He doesn't chase after the luxuries of life but rather is satisfied with the simple pleasures it offers. 

The thought that he is underpaid is always somewhere in the corner of his mind. Yet he willingly chooses not to focus on it. His outlook is rather optimistic. To him, having a stable job to pay his bills and live comfortably is a blessing in itself. Moreover, his work brings him a sense of purpose and satisfaction, something he values more than a hefty paycheck. Garry believes in the joy of working and being able to sustain himself, this makes him more than happy to have a job despite being underpaid.
B. We arrived at the meeting point, a small café downtown, around noon. The sky was brilliantly clear, the air heavy with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You, however, were nowhere to be found. We exchanged glances but decided to wait, hoping that the traffic was the cause of your delay.

An hour passed, followed by another, and soon it was three hours. Our coffees had turned cold, our spirits were slightly low but there was a strange determination in our hearts. ""We have been waiting for you for three hours,"" I remember Susan murmured. Yet, her voice lacked any trace of annoyance or frustration. Instead, there was an element of forgiveness, and she added, ""But that's okay. It’s better late than never.""

D. Once upon a time, in a bustling city known for its technological advancements, there was a leading corporation named TechnoDynamics. They were known worldwide for their high-tech, innovative products. However, a serious problem arose when they launched their newest creation, the Alpha X9, a next-gen AI assistant. Customers began to report serious malfunctions that made the product nearly impossible to use.

Instead of recalling the product, the executives of TechnoDynamics made a choice to throw in more and more money to fix the problem. Millions were spent on their top-notch R&D department, but the problem proved stubborn. Technicians, engineers, and programmers worked day and night to solve the AI's glitches, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the corporation kept throwing money at the problem, sinking deeper into debt. The confidence of shareholders was rapidly dwindling, putting the corporation at risk of bankruptcy. Despite its once sterling reputation, TechnoDynamics was now spiraling downwards, learning the hard way that not all problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them.",C,s and the 20112s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2012s and 2s and 2s and 2s and the 2s and the 0 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 2 the 2 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 2 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the 0 the

Over the past few decades, a large suburban community, christened Hillside Heights, has gradually developed outside the city center. What was once a vast, empty expanse of farmland, is now a bustling hub of activity, housing hundreds of families. The transformation has been remarkable, drawing people with its picturesque landscapes and sophisticated charm. 

The first change took place in the late 80s, when the main road was extended to reach this area. Builders saw the potential and value of this open land and began designing neighborhoods. Soon, schools, grocery stores, and other local businesses sprouted up, creating a mini economy within the community. 

From simple brick ranch-style houses to grand Victorian-style homes, the architecture in Hillside Heights is diverse and appealing. Amenities like parks, tennis courts, and a community pool have greatly contributed to the quality of life here. With its peaceful environment and a significant degree of self-sufficiency, the community is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the nearby city center. Hillside Heights is not only a testament to the expansion of the city's boundaries but also a reflection of changing lifestyle preferences over the years.
B. Laura was a budding indie artist, preparing to release her much-anticipated debut album. She had spent countless hours crafting the perfect melodies and lyrics, pouring her heart and soul into each song. Critics and fans alike were waiting with bated breath, convinced that Laura's album would be nothing short of a masterpiece.

The album was a collection of fourteen songs, each one a poignant story, a tiny fragment of Laura's life converted into beautiful melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The first thirteen songs were nothing short of spectacular. They resonated with the listeners, reverberating with the collective human experiences of love, loss, and healing. Every note, every strum, and every beat filled the air with an irrefutable magic, making the audience sway and sing along.

But when the last song played, a distinct discomfort filled the room. It was an upbeat pop song, a stark contrast from the beautiful melancholic tunes that characterized the rest of the album. It felt out of place and jarring, breaking the emotive spell the album had cast. All the songs on her album were amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.
C. John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence. It is a painful reality that he is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.
D. Jane, a seasoned executive at the corporate law firm, saw worry etched on the face of Jill, a newly hired intern. Jill had messed up an important client's paperwork and was afraid of the consequences. Jane, noticing Jill's distress, decided to step in and offer her some advice.

""Jill, everyone makes mistakes, it's an inevitable part of growth,"" Jane started, looking at Jill's anxious expression. ""The critical thing is how you handle it afterwards,"" Jane continued, her words slow and thoughtful. Jill seemed to be listening, her intense gaze fixed on Jane.

""Once you own up to your mistake, you'll feel better,"" Jane advised, her voice steady and sure. ""Hiding it or ignoring it will just add to your stress. Plus, taking responsibility reflects your sincerity and dedication.""

Jill took a deep breath, absorbing Jane's words. She knew what she had to do now: face the consequences, own up to her mistake, and learn from this experience.",B,"#include <iostream>

C. My life took a catastrophic turn when I lost my home and possessions in a devastating fire. My life felt like it was a collapsed jenga tower; everything I had built, everything I owned, had turned to ash in one horrifying night. The incident left me both emotionally and financially broken. I had no family to return to, no childhood home to seek refuge in. 

In my darkest hour, an opportunity to start over knocked at my door. I accepted a job offer from an old friend who owned a company in Arkansas. Barely a month after the disaster, I packed what little I owned into my old car and started my journey to the 'Natural State.' It was a new beginning for me, a chance to rebuild from scratch in a place where no one knew about my tragedies.

A few months into my new life, on an impulsive whim, I bought a lottery ticket. The gods must have seen the trials I'd been through, or maybe luck just felt like it owed me one. Miraculously, I won the Arkansas state lottery. It was a joy beyond belief, a silver lining after a devastating storm. Even though I lost everything in the fire, I ended up moving to Arkansas where I won the state lottery, turning my life around entirely.
D. In the heart of the bustling city of Washington D.C, a young and ambitious senator, John, received an urgent call. His assistant, Martha, breathlessly told him, ""You must go immediately if you want to meet with the Senate."" John understood the gravity of the situation; this was his chance to pitch his proposed law reforms directly to the Senate.

He glanced at the clock and it showed 3:00 PM, the peak of the notorious D.C. traffic. Martha warned him, ""Otherwise, you'll struggle due to the traffic."" He nodded, grabbing his jacket and hastily exiting his office, Martha swiftly handing him the crucial documents for his meeting.

Outside, he saw the swirling mass of vehicles, the audible groans of frustrated drivers resonating in the air. He quickly hailed a cab, praying to make it on time. As they swerved through the back roads to avoid the worst of the jam, he frantically went over his presentation in his head, the adrenaline of his impromptu journey propelling him forward.

A slender young man stood there, nervously shifting from foot to foot. His eyes were wide and filled with fear as he focused his gaze on the towering figure before him. 

""Do you know who you're facing?"" the young man's coach hastily whispered from the sidelines, panic coursing through his veins. He pointed a shaky finger at the person towering over his student. ""That's the world champion of taekwondo standing right there!"" His voice was filled with a mix of awe and fear, as he gave a sidelong glance to his student.

The young man's heart pounded fiercely in his chest but he stood his ground, now aware of the gravity of the situation. The world champion or not, he was not going to back down without a fight. His mentor's warning words echoed in his head as he walked forward, stepping into the spotlight to face the world champion, prepared to give his all, to fight the greatest battle of his life.
B. In the bustling state capital, politicians fervently debated the latest budget proposal. Part of the state budget, they realized, comes from the federal government’s contentious spending package. This spending package, while beneficial for some areas, sparked controversy nationwide due to its allocation towards controversial projects.

Governor Thompson, a seasoned politician, was troubled by this reality. He was aware of the constituents' growing concerns about accepting funds from a package that many of them fundamentally disagreed with. However, he also understood the dire need for financial resources in several underfunded areas within the state.

During a highly publicized town hall meeting, he addressed the issue head-on. He tried to explain the intricate balance of economics and politics involved in budget decisions. Many left the meeting still disgruntled, but a few seemed to appreciate the governor's honesty.

Thompson knew it was only the beginning of a long journey. Accepting the funds meant the ability to kick start much-needed initiatives in the state, but it also meant negotiating a delicate political landscape. He understood that as a leader, he had to face these difficult decisions, trying to serve his state's best interests amidst a sea of discord.
C. She was the talk of the town, spinning outrageous stories about everyone, giving them enough reasons to loathe her presence. She had been talking trash about us all week, whispering lies to anyone who would listen. Rumors filled the air like heavy fog, twisting and bending under the weight of her false allegations. It was a form of psychological warfare, bringing divisions and creating unnecessary rifts. 

I was caught in the crossfire of her savage words, my reputation unjustly tarnished. It was frustrating, but I clung to my dignity, hoping that the truth would soon clear the thick smog of her lies. 

Then, as though karma itself was thirsty for justice, someone unearthed her deepest secrets. They spilled them around town like a trail of breadcrumbs, each revelation painting an uncensored picture of her true colors. I should have felt a twinge of sympathy, considering the embarrassment she must have felt, but I found myself void of such emotions. She was simply reaping what she had sown, and I didn't feel sorry for her when her world started to crumble just as she had sought to demolish ours.
D. Nathan and Jessica were newlyweds starting their journey into family planning. Having grown up in varied backgrounds themselves, they understood the value of a diverse upbringing. Both were determined to not rely solely on one childcare method, knowing it could limit their future child's exposure to different experiences and teachings. 

Jessica, brought up in a strict and disciplined environment, wanted to incorporate some structure and rules in their child's upbringing. She believed that having clear boundaries would teach their child about responsibility and respect. On the other hand, Nathan had been raised in a freethinking household. He thought that a liberal environment would encourage creativity and free expression in their child.

They understood that different parenting styles contribute to a well-rounded upbringing, so they decided to blend their individual approaches. They would set boundaries but also allow enough freedom for their child to explore and express. By adopting this integrated method, they hoped to give their child the best of both worlds, promoting growth, discipline, creativity, and self-expression. It was a careful balancing act, but one that they were confident would make their child well-rounded, adaptable, and open-minded.",C,"#1 New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, the Times of London, the Economist, the Economist, the Financial Times, the Guardian, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian Weekly, the Guardian"
329,How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?.,"Jessica tossed her long, blonde hair over her shoulder, glancing at her friend with a mixture of disbelief and concern. ""How can you expect not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all, Sarah?"" she questioned, eyes wide with worry. Sarah merely shrugged, a casual dismissal that sent a jolt of anxiety through Jessica.

""You're so smart, Jess. I’m sure I can borrow your notes before the test,"" Sarah said nonchalantly, leaning back on the library chair. Jessica stared back at her, the weight of her friend's careless attitude causing a crease between her eyebrows.

She loved Sarah dearly, but her consistent lack of dedication had always been a source of contention between them. ""That's not the point, Sarah."" Jessica replied, a hint of frustration seeping into her voice. ""You need to start taking your studies seriously.""

Sarah simply gave her a dismissive wave, a clear sign that she had no intention of heeding her advice. Jessica sighed deeply, closing her books and looking at her friend with disappointment, unsure of how to make Sarah understand the importance of studying.","A. Emily and John had been business partners for years and they always worked things out smoothly. But, this time it was different. It was about a business proposal that needed immediate attention and a crucial decision. John, out of over-confidence or ignorance, didn't discuss the problem with Emily right then and there.

Emily got the news the next day when the proposal fell apart. She was furious. ""It would have been okay if you had discussed the problem right then and there,"" she lamented to John, her voice echoing throughout their office. She tried to keep her emotions under control, but it was difficult. ""Now, it's too late and a lot of work is required to rectify this,"" she added, her eyes filled with a rare frustration.

John, understanding his lapse, felt guilt welling up inside him. He didn't want the partnership, built over mutual trust and understanding, to suffer due to his momentary lapse of judgment. He realized the need for immediate action to correct this error. In the silence of their office, he vowed to make things right, no matter how much effort it demanded from him. He hoped his efforts could preserve their relationship and rectify the problem he had caused in their business partnership.
B. For years, Jeffrey had been known as the night owl of the family. Often, he would find himself engrossed in a book or a movie well past midnight. ""If you don't go to sleep early, you will wake up late,"" his mother warned him constantly. But Jeffrey, engrossed in his activities, would simply nod and continue. 

The impending consequence of his actions was always in the back of his mind, but he never really gave it much importance. However, one day, he received an important job interview that was scheduled for early in the morning. He stayed up late the night before out of excitement and anxiety. 

The next day, as his mother had predicted, he woke up late. He rushed to get ready, but the interview had already started by the time he arrived. Jeffrey learnt the hard way the truth of the old saying: ""As you sow, so shall you reap."" Now, he makes sure to get a good night's rest every day.
C. Frank had been all around the world, from bustling cities to desolate deserts, in pursuit of his career. A translator by profession, his work took him far and wide, away from the comfort of his small town in New Hampshire. Being a diligent and committed man, Frank invested years in adapting to diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. But, he always yearned for the familiarity and comfort of his hometown. 

One winter, after a decade overseas, Frank decided to return home. He was ecstatic as he packed his bags, each piece of clothing he folded bringing him one step closer to the solace he missed. The journey felt nostalgic as he drove through the sleepy lanes leading to his quaint wooden house. 

Finally, Frank found himself in his old room, staring at the childhood bed that bore witness to his dreams of adventure. The sight of the bed, washed in the soft, warm glow of his old table lamp, invited him with an embrace of familiarity. That night, he crawled under his worn-out quilt, and for the first time in years, Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed, surrounded by the soothing aura of his home country.
D. In the heart of the FBI headquarters, Agent Reynolds was handed a pile of files by his supervisor. ""These files require a thorough look, don't skim through them quickly,"" warned the supervisor, sternly. Each file was brimming with information about a series of high-profile heists that had taken place over the past month, and it was Reynolds' job to find a connection. 

Reluctantly, he nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. He found himself in the confines of his small office, glaring at the daunting pile. Each file represented a unique mystery in itself, with potential leads, suspects, and associated evidence. He dived into the first file, poring over every detail meticulously, hoping to uncover an overlooked clue. 

Hours turned into days as Reynolds immersed himself in the documentation, keeping himself fueled with a potent mix of determination and caffeine. As he dug deeper, patterns began to emerge, and a detailed profile of the suspects' modus operandi began to take shape. Eventually, after an intensive examination, a sense of achievement filled his tired eyes. He had not just a lead, but a plausible theory about the perpetrators of the heists. His supervisor was right; these files required a thorough look, and it was through his diligent attention to detail that he may have just cracked the case.",B,D
330,"Fred built an immense fortune by swindling others, but he lost it all when someone swindled him.","Fred was a crafty man, renowned for his sharp mind and razor-like wit. He was a natural wheeler and dealer, with an uncanny knack for exploiting opportunities. Unfortunately, these opportunities were often at the expense of others, for Fred made his wealth by swindling innocent people out of their hard-earned money.

For years, Fred's empires were built on deceit and treachery, promising wealth and prosperity to those who could hardly afford to lose. He lived lavishly, often seen with the most expensive suits, the fastest cars, and the most beautiful companions. His immense fortune was the talk of the town, admired by many and despised by the ones he tricked.

However, Fred's life took a drastic turn when he became the target of his own game. A man as clever and ruthless as he was approached him with an irresistible business deal. Fred, always hungry for more, didn't notice the glaring red flags and invested his entire wealth into the venture.

But the deal was a sham, designed meticulously to strip Fred of his immense fortune. He lost it all in the blink of an eye, falling victim to the same swindling strategies he had once used. The irony was not lost on those who had suffered at his hands, and Fred was left with nothing, a poignant reminder of his deceptive past.","A. In a small coastal town, known for its fresh produce, was a shopkeeper named Elias. He owned the largest grocery store in town, providing the locals with most of their daily necessities. However, Elias had a dubious reputation that followed him everywhere - he always palms off old stock to the customers.

Elias would stock his shelves with fresh goods in the morning, but save the older, nearly expired items in the back. Throughout the day, he would slyly convince his customers to buy this old stock, using sweet words and discounted prices. The locals, trusting his familiar face, rarely questioned him about the quality of the goods.

The town's elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, regularly visited his store for their weekly groceries. They were often the victims of his ploys, ending up with half-rotten tomatoes and stale bread more often than not. But they would smile and continue with their purchase, either too kind to protest or too innocent to notice the truth.

As time went by, Elias's tactic of swindling the locals became a well-known fact, yet it hardly affected his business. The residents of the small coastal town continued to buy from him - some out of convenience, others out of habit.
B. There once was a mischievous boy, living in a small village nestled against a foreboding forest, who took great delight in tricking his fellow villagers. To pass the time, he would call out, ""Wolf! Wolf!"", feigning distress, causing the hard-working villagers to drop everything to come to his aid. He would then laugh, and his laughter echoed throughout the peaceful valley, disrupting the quiet serenity that usually prevailed. This happened time and time again, until the villagers started to lose patience with the little boy's pranks. 

One cold winter day, the boy, emboldened by past success, repeated his false cry. But this time, nobody hurried to his rescue, weary of his previous false alarms. Unbeknownst to them, however, this time, the cry was authentic. A pack of starving wolves had strayed from the forest, drawn by the scent of the village's livestock. The boy was terrified as the fierce creatures came closer and closer, his desperate cries for help fading into the chilling wind. Ultimately, the boy who cried wolf learned a grave and costly lesson, earning his comeuppance the day the wolves really came.
C. Once there was a young woman named Amelia, just entering her 20s. She had always been told that her 20s would be the best time of her life, a phase she should enjoy while it lasts. At first, Amelia was skeptical. She had just graduated from college, burdened with student loans, and faced a very competitive job market. 

However, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Amelia started to understand why people said her 20s were the golden age. She landed her first job as a software developer, giving her the chance to put her academic learnings into practical work. She discovered new strengths, explored her passions, made new friends, and even traveled to places she had only dreamed about. 

Each accomplishment, every hurdle overcome, all added to her personal growth and self-discovery. The journey was far from easy but each experience was enriching. As the years passed, Amelia realized that indeed, her 20s were an incredible time of her life, a period of self-discovery and growth that she needed to cherish before it fades into a sweet memory.
D. John had spent his life in a seemingly perfect relationship with his partner, Emily. They shared a comfort that most couples envied; but with time, a subtle discontent started brewing within him. The glamour of fiery passion in movies and novels stirred a yearning in his heart for a love that was more dramatic, more intoxicating. He decided to embark on a quest to find this supposed ""true love.""

Against Emily's pleas and tears, he left his familiar life behind, diving headfirst into a whirlpool of unknown emotions. John dated various women, tried to find that spark he saw in romantic films, but every relationship ended the same way. None of them ignited the flame he was longing for, instead, they were all marred with superficiality, misunderstandings, and disagreements.

In his solitude, he began reflecting on his past relationship with Emily. Suddenly, he was overwhelmed by the memories of their shared laughter, mutual respect, deep conversations, and undeniable comfort. It dawned upon him, the regret hitting him like a punch to the gut, that he had already found his true love in Emily, and he let it slip away, chasing an illusion of love curated by fiction.",B,"# 1.

331,"He spent years trying to avoid paying taxes, and now he's facing nearly 10 years in prison for it.","For decades, Thomas had been an artful dodger of tax payments. Every year, he would sit at his large mahogany desk and meticulously find every possible loophole that he could exploit to avoid contributing to the government coffers. He had a plethora of offshore bank accounts, businesses registered under different aliases, and he'd even explored the uncharted territory of cryptocurrency. He saw himself as a fiscal genius, a virtuoso of financial evasion. He was proud of his growing wealth and truly believed that he was outwitting the system.

Everything seemed perfect in his paradise of deceit until one cold January morning when a knock on his door echoed through his mansion. The men who stood on his doorstep were not interested in the expensive artwork on the walls or the luxury cars in the driveway. Their focus was on the man who had managed to avoid paying taxes for more than twenty years. The Internal Revenue Service, along with the FBI, had finally caught on to his illicit activities. Now, after years of enjoying his ill-gotten wealth, Thomas was staring at the possibility of nearly 10 years behind the cold, bleak bars of a federal prison.","A.

B. Monica, a seasoned chef at La Bella Pizzeria, had an incredibly busy weekend. The restaurant, usually bustling, was filled to the brim with an unexpected wave of customers. Some were locals craving their favorite pizza, while others were tourists eager to try Monica's highly praised Italian dishes. The orders kept piling up, but Monica, diligent and passionate, refused to back down.

She juggled making pasta, baking pizzas, and creating sumptuous desserts from dawn till dusk, pushing her usual limits. As the mastermind behind the culinary magic, she wanted every customer to savor the best Italian delicacies. 

However, this strenuous weekend took a heavy toll on her physically and mentally. Despite her unending love for cooking, Monica acknowledged that she needed a break to recharge herself. Thus, she decided to take a day off, requesting a leave for Monday. Indeed, even the most dedicated chefs, like Monica, require a well-deserved rest after such exhausting culinary marathons.
C. Writing a novel is not a walk in the park; it requires an incredible amount of effort. Many people underestimate the work writers put into their craft, assuming that because they are not in a traditional 9-to-5 job, they do not perform anything worthy. However, this could not be further from the truth. 

The initial stage of writing a novel often involves extensive research. This can take months or even years, depending on the subject matter. It involves getting to know characters, their motivations, and the world they live in. Once the research is complete, the planning stage begins. Every scene must be meticulously thought out and linked seamlessly to create a coherent and engaging story.

Then, comes the actual writing which can take months, or even years of dedication and hard work. It involves countless revisions and proofreading to ensure that the story is well structured and error-free. After all this, the novel must be pitched to publishers, a task that requires a different set of skills altogether. The publishing process itself can be a grueling journey. So, let us not undervalue the hard work that writers put into their craft. Writing a novel is an enormous undertaking that requires persistence, creativity, and dedication.
D. Although Lexi looks like an airhead, with her constantly changing hair color and an inexplicable love for oversized, flashy accessories, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met. Her quirky appearance always manages to take people by surprise when she voices her thoughts. We first crossed paths at a local café, where Lexi was wearing a sunflower crown and sporting a bright blue hair. I remember overhearing her conversation with the elderly man at the next table, about the geopolitical ramifications of a recent election.

Even though her flashy appearance said otherwise, her intellect and insight were evident in her every word. Lexi's wisdom extends beyond politics. She can, in one moment, discuss the finer points of classical literature, then easily switch to explaining the complexities of quantum physics or debating the abstract philosophies of life. 

Being around her, I began to understand the depth of her knowledge and the breadth of her understanding. It was a lesson to not judge someone by their appearance, because here was Lexi, vibrant and quirky, yet full of wisdom that could put the wisest of scholars to shame. Despite her exterior portraying her as an airhead, Lexi has, and continues to be, a paragon of wisdom and intellect to me.",A,

Congressman Bernard Foster was an ambitious man, driven by his desire to bring about effective change in his beloved state. For months, he worked tirelessly on a bill he firmly believed would radically change the lives of his constituents for the better. He became consumed in drafting it, meticulously scrutinizing each phrase and word, ensuring every paragraph echoed his noble intentions. 

Each late night in the office was devoted to its fine-tuning, each clause and footnote dissected and reassembled to meet his exact vision. However, while he was engrossed in this painstaking process, he failed to consider the greater political climate around him. Despite his noble intentions, his proposed bill was far more progressive than many of his conservative colleagues would accept.

Time and time again, his fellow congressmen expressed their clear disdain for such radical change. Even some of his closest allies voiced their concerns regarding the bill's feasibility. Yet, absorbed in the technicalities and precise wording of his bill, Congressman Foster remained oblivious to these warnings. He would not understand the gravity of his oversight until his meticulously crafted bill was overwhelmingly rejected on the Senate floor.
B. In the heart of a cozy, rustic kitchen sat a pot-bellied, old-fashioned stove. It was a cold winter night and the stove was working at its peak, radiating an immense amount of warmth. Alongside the stove, there was a small wooden counter where all the cooking magic happened. Unexpectedly, a forgotten bar of chocolate sat there, brought in earlier with the intention of being a bedtime snack.

The bar was a fine dark chocolate, considered a delicacy in the house, saved for special occasions or late-night cravings. The owner of the house, an elderly woman named Martha, had placed it there and got distracted by a phone call. Little by little, the heat emitted by the bustling stove began to have an effect on the chocolate. The once solid, decadent bar started to soften, its form losing its rigidness and slowly changing into a glossy pool. 

With a sigh, Martha ended her call and turned around to find her favorite chocolate bar transformed. It was bittersweet to see her bedtime treat in such a state, yet she couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, realizing the powerful presence of heat in her warm and inviting kitchen.

D. Jane has always seen things that others don't. Ever since childhood, she's been drawn to the unusual, the ordinary that's seen from an extraordinary lens. John, an average man in the eyes of the general public, caught her attention on a regular day at her usual coffee shop. He was standing behind the counter, blending with the mundane scene around him. But not for Jane.

From his ginger hair, slightly tousled, to his freckles adorning his face like constellations; everything about him was perfect to her. She saw the way his green eyes would light up when he made a good cup of coffee or the way his face crinkled up when he laughed. To her, he was a masterpiece, the embodiment of everything charming and attractive. She found herself falling for his uniqueness, his ordinariness that so many seemed to overlook.

Even though her friends saw him as nothing but an average joe, Jane cherished this man who, to her, stood out as the most attractive man in the world.

John is a brilliant man, always engrossed in his work as a renowned cardiologist. His dedication and commitment are unwavering, often leaving him buried in medical journals and complex surgeries for hours on end. His work, as significant as it is, began consuming him, compelling him to spend late nights at the hospital, and leaving him with little time for anything else.

His personal life has begun to fade away, like a distant memory. The once lively spirit who loved hiking and playing basketball with friends had become a shadow of his former self. He was missing out on the thrill of life, the shared laughter, the spontaneous trips, and most importantly, his family.

John has a loving wife, Emma, and two adorable kids, Sophie and Ryan. He missed out on their first steps, first words, school functions, and even their birthdays. Emma constantly urges John to spend more time with them, but his work always seems to take precedence. It is a painful reality that he is so engrossed in his work that he is missing out on his personal life and his family.
B. At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears absolutely glamorous. Flashing lights, red carpets, and designer clothing make it seem as though they live in a perpetual state of joy and contentment. But beyond the gloss and shine of their public image, there hides an entirely different reality. Stars often say that fame is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they enjoy immense wealth, luxury, and admiration that most can only dream about. On the other hand, they have to pay a heavy price for their popularity. The relentless scrutiny, loss of privacy, and constant pressure to remain relevant often lead to a life filled with stress and anxiety. Their every move, every word is watched and dissected, leaving them little room for genuine human experiences. In fact, they face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine, silently struggling under the weight of their fame. Thus, the shiny life of a celebrity is not as enviable as it appears, brimming with complex challenges hidden from the public eye.

D. The war, which had raged on for several brutal years, had finally reached its conclusion. The wreckage was immense, lives were lost, infrastructure destroyed, and cities crumbled to dust. All across the globe, countries were worn and tattered from the fierce conflict that had gripped them. Amidst the carnage, however, a flicker of hope sparked.

World leaders, their eyes opened to the destruction, realized the cost of their animosity. They decided to mend the relationship that was earlier characterized by endless confrontations and power struggles. The war had inflicted enough damage, and it was time to build, not destroy. 

Resolutions were passed, treaties were signed, and the countries pledged to maintain friendly relations with each other. The aftermath of war was a difficult period, a test of strength and resilience, but they decided to face it united. A new era dawned, not of conflict and power struggle, but of understanding, cooperation and friendship.

334,"She wanted to buy a dress in case someone asked her to the dance, but I told her not to count her chickens before they hatched.","Emma was a shy girl, not exactly the type the school's heartthrobs queued up to ask out for dances. However, she nurtured a secret hope that one day, her quiet presence would catch someone's eye. So, she often saved up her pocket money, dreaming of buying that gorgeous red dress on display in the vintage boutique downtown. She wanted to buy a dress in case someone asked her to the dance.

One day, she shared this secret with me, her best friend. Seeing the yearning in her eyes, my heart ached for her. But I also knew that it was not wise to foster false hope. So, I told her gently, ""Emma, I understand your wish. But, don't count your chickens before they hatch. You should focus on finding happiness in the present rather than waiting for a future event that may or may not occur.""","A. Every morning, I have a steadfast routine of strolling into the downtown cafe for my daily fix of caffeine. It's an indulgence I've always allowed myself, rationalizing that it's a small expense for such a big pleasure. A double-shot of espresso to start my day, a late morning latte, an afternoon cappuccino; coffee was my fuel, my lifeline. 

I never really thought about my tiny daily coffee expenses until I began to audit my finances. As a freelance graphic designer, my income was wildly inconsistent, but the expense for my coffee never faltered. When I sat down to pour over my bank statement, I was floored. The daily $5 here and $4 there had accumulated over the month into a sizable portion of my income. 

Staring at the numbers, I felt a knot in my stomach. I realized that my beloved coffee habit was draining up all my income. The decision was difficult, but inevitable; the time had come to invest in a coffee machine at home and drastically cut down on my cafe visits.
B. On a typical weekday morning, Tom woke up and thought of a new challenge - he decided to drive to his office for the first time. Having only recently acquired his driving license, Tom was eager to flaunt his new skill. Looking out the window, he saw the bustle of the city roads, and naively thought, ""It looks easy but it is very hard to drive a car in this traffic."" 

As he got into his car, a sense of determination flooded him. He started his journey, but very soon was submerged into the chaotic labyrinth of urban traffic. Cars of all sizes were trying to outsmart each other, trying to find any room possible to pass through. The honking horns and the frequent brake lights turned his simple morning drive into a nerve-racking test. 

An hour passed in what seemed like an eternity, and Tom found himself only halfway to his destination. He then realized the truth of the common saying, ""Only experienced drivers can navigate this chaos."" Wiping the sweat off his brow, Tom quietly admired those who braved these roads daily. He understood that driving wasn't just about controlling the steering wheel, but it also required adaptability and a lot of patience. He decided then and there that he needed more practice before he could join the ranks of those seasoned drivers.
C. Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest adorned with lush green trees, there stood a magnificent oak tree, the oldest and tallest among them. Its grandeur and magnificent aura provided shade and shelter to countless creatures. One fateful night, a storm ravaged the forest, severely damaging many of the trees. The relentless winds managed to fell the grand oak tree, it's mighty fall echoed throughout the forest. 

Come the morning, the woodland inhabitants were in for a shock. The vast expanse that once thrived under the shade of the grand oak was now exposed to the scorching sun. A fallen tree, it was realized, cannot provide shade, a sentiment that echoed through every creature's heart. The squirrels, the birds, the insects, all missed the comforting shade they once called home. 

This realization marked a turning point in the lives of the forest dwellers. Despite the loss of their beloved tree, they understood the power of change, even if it was painful. And in the grand oak's memory, they grew stronger, embracing the sunlight with resilience, and learned to adapt to their new environment.

335,"He wanted to buy a big house and a car, but his father advised him to get a job first.","Ever since he was a child, Jacob had dreamed of owning a big house and a stylish car. He imagined himself living in luxury, with vast rooms filled with opulent furnishings and a sleek, shiny car parked in the driveway. Now, at the age of twenty-three, Jacob was determined to turn those dreams into reality.

One day, Jacob confided his ambitions in his father. He talked enthusiastically about buying a big house and a sophisticated car, his eyes shining with desire and excitement. However, his father, a man of modest means and practical wisdom, gave him a serious look.

""Jacob,"" he said in a firm yet caring voice, ""It's good to have dreams. It's even better to have the ambition to achieve them. But before you start thinking about buying a house or a car, you need to have a stable income. I would advise you to get a job first.""

The words of his father resonated with Jacob, making him rethink his impulsive plans. He realized that before he could begin building his dream life, he would first need to build a solid foundation. So he set his immediate sights on finding a good job, with the dreams of a big house and a car kept safely in his heart for the future.","A.

B. Being accepted into the prestigious Hawthorne Institute is not an easy task. It requires a tremendous amount of focus and discipline to clear the entrance exam, a test designed to measure not only the intelligence but the perseverance and determination of the applicants. Not everyone can pass it; every year, out of hundreds of candidates, only a handful of the brightest and most determined scholars make it through.

Take the case of Amelia Jenkins, a determined and passionate student who had her eyes set on the Institute since her early childhood. Day in and day out, she would immerse herself in her studies, foregoing social events and other recreational activities. She understood that casual leisure was a luxury she couldn't afford at the moment. 

Yet, even with such intense determination and unwavering focus, Amelia found herself struggling with some of the complex problems in the entrance exam. She realized that merely studying hard would not guarantee her success; she needed to study smart as well. Adopting new strategies and methods, she started approaching the problems from a different perspective. Eventually, with her relentless effort, she managed to clear the exam, proving that while the task was indeed challenging, it was not impossible. It merely required an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, and a smart approach to problem-solving.
C. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
D. She had been working tirelessly on a high-profile project for her company. Every day for weeks, she would wake up before sunrise and go to sleep way past midnight. Her mind constantly buzzed with deadlines, strategies, and implementations. While she loved her work, the intensity of this project started to take a toll on her mental and physical well-being.

Her face became gaunt, dark circles took permanent residency under her eyes, and her once jovem spirit started to feel weary. She could see her performance declining, mistakes slipping in her work that she would have never made before. The realization hit her hard; she was severely exhausted.

Something had to change. Thus, she decided to take a break and prioritize her health. She requested a month off work, packed her favorite books and clothes, and flew to a tropical island for a well-deserved vacation to rejuvenate herself.",A,#2019-05-06-07-08-09-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-28-29-30-31-32-33-34-35-36-37-38-39-40-41-42-43-44-45-46-47-48-49-50-51-52-53-54-55-56-57-58-59-60-61-62-63-64-65-66-67-68-69-70-71-72-73-74-75-76-77-78-79-80-81-82-83-84-85-86-87-88-89-90-91-92-93-94-95-96-97-98-99-100-101-

A big work project was in its peak stage and she was one of the key members in her team.

Her heart sank as she started making vacation plans but realized she might not get leave until the project was done. Mary found herself caught between her job responsibilities and the need to give herself a break. On the one hand, the project held importance, but on the other hand, her yearning for vacation grew more intense by the day.

She sighed and closed the tab, making a mental note to reward herself with the trip once the project was successfully completed.","A. Every Wednesday evening, our small community center transforms into a vibrant dance studio. Friends and neighbors, young and old, come together to learn Salsa under the guidance of Miss Brenda, the dance instructor who owns a heart as lively as her dance steps. Everyone, except for Sandy. Sandy is the only one who doesn't show up to the dance class.

Her absence isn't unnoticed, we are always an uneven group and due to her consistent absence, one of us is always without a partner. Last Wednesday, it was Bill who stood alone, looking quite awkward. The week before, it was sweet old Mrs. McKinley, who bravely chose to dance by herself rather than miss out on the fun. It had even been me, once or twice, left standing alone when the rhythm of salsa filled the air. 

In fact, her chronic absence has turned into our own little joke, 'Who's going to be the Sandy-less one this week?'. It's all in good fun, but we can't help but wish that one day, Sandy will surprise us all, walk through that door, and no one will be left without a partner again.

C. Peter's parents, John and Lisa, often shared a sentiment with their close friends that they did not consider themselves to be good parents at all. Despite their self-doubt, they always made a conscious effort to prioritize their family. They knew their weaknesses but it was their belief in the idea of spending quality time with their children that kept them going.

They made it a point to clear their schedules, putting their children above any work or social obligations. Regardless of how they perceived their parenting skills, they would diligently make time for their children. They attended every school play, every football match, every piano recital, every parent-teacher meeting, and never missed celebrating a single birthday.

John would often sit up late into the night, helping Peter with his science projects. Lisa, on the other hand, made sure she was there to listen when their younger daughter, Amy, came home upset about her school life. Through their actions, they showed a level of commitment that contrasted starkly with their perception of themselves as parents.

Despite their self-critical approach, Peter, Amy, and all those who knew them could easily see the truth - that they were in fact, really good parents. They might have believed they were lacking in some areas, but their dedication to spending quality time with their children was evidence enough of their great parenting.
D. I had been counting on Kim, my closest friend since childhood, to stand by my side during one of the most important days of my life. Her excitement matched mine when I first shared the news of my engagement, and naturally, I assumed she would be my maid of honor. But as the date approached, Kim had been curiously aloof, not sharing in my enthusiasm. 

Then, one day, she simply said, ""I'm sorry, I can't support you at your wedding."" Her words were like a sharp, unexpected stab, leaving me wounded and confused. She did not explain, nor did I have the courage to ask for an explanation. 

I was mad, even outraged at Kim, feeling the sting of her unexpected betrayal. Every wedding preparation, every floral arrangement, every bridal fitting seemed tainted by her absence. Friends and family rallied around me, offering their support and love, but Kim's absence loomed like a dark cloud over my happiness. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry, my wedding marred by the startling realization that Kim had chosen not to support me on my special day.",B,s are a great.

Victor was a classmate of mine at Jefferson High School; a peculiar fellow who was known for his odd habits. One of his most peculiar habits was his obsession with collecting old coins. Every school day, he would bring his collection in an old, worn-out leather bag, the coins chinking together musically as he walked. And, as per his daily ritual, he would attempt to sell them to his classmates, including me.

""Hey, check this out,"" he would often say, pulling out a coin that looked particularly ancient and worn out. He would continue, ""It's rare and valuable. You could make a fortune if you sold it to the right person."" 

Regardless of his impressive salesmanship, I was never convinced to buy any. Victor didn't seem to mind, though; the next day, he would approach me again with the same enthusiasm, with a new 'rare' coin that he claimed would 'change my life'. Despite his relentless sales pitches, we became good friends, with me appreciating his passion and him, my patience. Though I never invested in his coins, I did invest in our friendship, and to this day, we still share a good laugh about his never-ending coin-selling attempts.
B. As a child, I was always the shy one in my family, frequently consumed by social anxiety. It made me nervous to even think about talking in front of a group of people, let alone an auditorium filled with them. Back in high school, an opportunity presented itself that I thought would help me conquer my fears. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and joined the debate club. 

The very first time I had to stand up in front of the club and argue my case, I felt nauseous. But as time passed, and with each successive debate, I found my confidence growing. I was learning to focus my nerves into my arguments, channeling the energy into persuasive, compelling words. My team members encouraged me, giving me useful tips and helping me improve my skills. I never thought I'd say this, but joining the debate club was the best decision I'd ever made.

Many years later, I had become a powerful and persuasive public speaker, all thanks to the debate club. The once painfully shy kid with social anxiety had transformed completely, proving that sometimes you just have to take that terrifying first step.

D. As a freshly graduated journalism student, Billy had always held a reverential respect for the art of journalism. He believed in the power of the pen to expose truths, spark important discussions, and stimulate change. One day, his editor pulled him aside and warned him, ""You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.""

Billy was taken aback, his youthful enthusiasm momentarily quashed. He realized that he had perhaps been too swayed by the sensational stories that had been increasingly prevalent in recent times. His passion for journalism had been overshadowed by the urge to keep up with competing media houses.

This conversation served as a reality check and reminded him of the true purpose of journalism. He resolved to uphold the integrity of his profession, promising himself to focus on hard facts and truth rather than getting carried away by the lure of high viewership and sensationalism. 

From that day onward, Billy decided to maintain his commitment to ethical journalism. His pen would no longer be used to spread baseless rumors or sensational gossip but would be a tool to stimulate thoughtful discussions, expose corruption, and promote truth. The reminder from his editor guided him throughout his career, serving as a constant reminder of his commitment to responsible journalism.",C,"```

338,John wanted to build and paint the nursery without having heard the adoption agency's decision.,"John and his wife, Liza, had long awaited the arrival of a little one. Even before they embarked on their adoption journey, John had dreamt of building and painting a nursery for their future child. The room was a perfect square, its window overseeing the sprawling garden where he envisaged his little one playing one day. Every spare minute he had, he began transforming the spare room into a haven, without having even heard the adoption agency's decision.

He painted walls with gentle hues of blues and pinks. He built sturdy shelves that could house an entire universe of books. John was meticulous, ensuring every corner of the room was baby-proofed, every socket secured. As he painted the last wall, his hands slightly trembling, a mixture of fear and hope warmed his heart.

Liza would often find him sitting quietly in the room, staring at the beautifully painted walls with a distant look in his eyes. But no matter what the adoption agency's decision turned out to be, John was determined that the room would not go in vain, it would be a sanctuary of hope, a testament to their love and longing for a child.","A. The army had been deployed in a covert mission to reclaim a stolen city from insurgent forces. Upon arrival, they'd been met with a surprise, facing a far stronger opposition than intelligence had predicted. The battle had been fierce, unrelenting. Bullet exchanges had echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional cries of fallen men. The enemy resistance was formidable, with an arsenal of weapons that far exceeded the army's expectation.

As the sun started to dip below the horizon, they had lost half of their soldiers. Their morale was shaky at best, and the thought of defeat crept menacingly into each soldier's mind. Desperation kicked in as the realization that they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned dawned on them. The commanding officer, after a moment of grim deliberation, made a decision that would inevitably shift the tide of the war. They had no other option but to use the solitary tank in their possession, a last resort tool of destruction, to retaliate against their formidable enemy.
B. Sarah had been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Chris, for several years now. She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights. Every time she closed her eyes, she imagined themselves sipping coffee at a quaint café, sharing an intimate dinner near the Eiffel Tower, and losing themselves in the Louvre's enchanting art. She had always dreamt of visiting Paris and this offer seemed like an opportune moment. 

Sarah wanted to book the honeymoon tickets before she had even been proposed to. She reasoned that it could be a delightful surprise for Chris, and a tangible testament to her deep faith in their future together. However, she decided to wait for him to pop the question, hoping that day wasn't too far away.
C. Her athletic career began rather innocuously with her first visit to the gym at just thirteen years old. Hannah, an unassuming teenager with a petite frame and freckles scattered across her cheeks, decided to join her local community gym at her mother's insistence. She had been a frail child, and her parents thought physical exercise might give her the boost in strength she needed. Little did they know, the gym would be the gateway to Hannah's world of athletics.

It wasn't long before Hannah's enthusiasm for fitness began to shine. She poured her heart and soul into each workout, each exercise, each mile she ran on the treadmill. With every weight she lifted, every drop of sweat she shed, she transformed from a weak and frail girl into an embodiment of strength and determination. Her phenomenal dedication did not go unnoticed; her physical education teacher suggested she consider a career in athletics, remarking that he had rarely seen such commitment.

Her dedication paid off and her athletic career took off in leaps and bounds. Hannah never looked back, her devotion unwavering, her spirit unyielding. Now, years later, that same petite girl with freckles scattered across her cheeks stands as a world-class athlete, her name synonymous with strength, resolve, and dedication. The gym, which had been her gateway, is now her haven, the foundation of a triumphant athletic career.
D. Clark and Cece had known each other since their first day at college, becoming friends and eventually falling deeply in love. For a long time, their friendship turned romance was the talk of our circle, with everyone thinking that a proposal was on the cards soon. As the years rolled by, however, and Clark hadn't asked the question, we all began to lose hope. 

Cece was the perfect woman, beautiful, intelligent, and full of life. We couldn't understand why Clark kept hesitating. For ten years, Cece waited patiently, never pushing him, but her eyes were always filled with the quiet anticipation that today might be the day. As friends, we were rooting for them, hoping that he would finally take that step.

She was deeply in love and was eagerly waiting for the day he would ask her to be his wife. This anticipation was so profound that she found herself constantly daydreaming about their honeymoon. One day, she came across a promotional offer for a romantic trip to Paris, the city of love.

From that moment on, she couldn't shake the thought of strolling hand in hand with Chris under the mesmerizing Parisian lights.

Larry was beginning to lose hope when one day a golden envelope arrived in his mailbox. His heart pounded in his chest as he recognized the official seal of the 'Mystery Writers Meet' stamped on it.

B. Every couple has heard the old saying that goes something like ""Enjoy the honeymoon period of your marriage as much as you can before it passes."" For newlyweds Mark and Emily, this piece of wisdom was repeated by their loved ones so frequently that it almost felt like a challenge.

Just after their wedding, they found themselves caught in a euphoric whirlwind of laughter, affection, and endless happiness. Each day was filled with breakfasts in bed, hand-holding during sunset strolls, and sweet whispers of undying love. They basked in the absolute joy of their new union, never missing an opportunity to express their affection for each other.

However, the phrase ""before it passes"" lingered in the back of their minds. It left them with a subtle yet unnerving sense of dread, hinting at a doomsday that would mark the end of their blissful togetherness. They questioned, if such contentment were to end, what would their relationship become? They feared the potential of falling into a mundane routine, devoid of the passion that presently fueled their romance.

Determined to not let this ominous prophecy cast a shadow over their marital bliss, they decided to cherish each moment instead of fearing its end. They would make the most of their honeymoon period, allowing its sweetness to seep into the foundation of their marriage. This way, they believed, they could preserve the honeymoon essence, letting it flow beyond just a phase and into their lifelong journey together.
C. Ally was an ambitious woman in her mid-30s who dedicated her life to her career. Over the past couple of weeks, the workload at the office had been extensive due to some major contracts that the company was handling. She often found herself working late into the night, barely sleeping for a few hours, before being back at her desk again. Unfortunately, her body couldn't keep up with the pace of her determination.

A few days back, Ally noticed that she was feeling weaker than usual. She had headaches that seemed to never subside and her whole body felt achy. Yet, she kept brushing it off, attributing it to the stress and long hours at work. However, the morning after a particular all-nighter, Ally woke up feeling extremely sick.

Incapable of getting out of bed, she was left with no choice but to call in sick. The doctor confirmed her worst fears and advised complete bed rest over the weekend. So, this weekend Ally found herself in a strange scenario. She was away from her desk and work, doing nothing but resting, allowing her body the much-needed break it deserved.
D. Kim had a bustling Friday afternoon before her, packed with back to back faculty meetings and piles of paperwork. So, as the prospect of a peaceful weekend drew nearer, she decided to check the papers hastily, just to get it all done. The pile of student essays on her desk seemed daunting, but she ploughed through them, checking off mistakes, leaving brief comments, and assigning grades. She raced against the clock, her pen skimming through the papers in a rush, and by early evening, she had finished.

Thrilled with her efficiency, she left the papers on her desk, locked the office, and walked out, ready to have some well-deserved free time. She envisioned an entire weekend of relaxation, free from the piles of essays and tests that often bogged her down. For once, Kim was looking forward to a work-free weekend.

However, her serenity was short-lived. By Monday, she was met with a chorus of complaints from her students, claiming their papers were graded too harshly and the feedback was unclear. Disgruntled, Kim realized that she had been too hasty in her checking. Now she has to spend an entire day, or maybe even more, rechecking the papers, trying to balance her need for free time with the necessity of doing her job correctly.

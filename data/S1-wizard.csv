C. My sister cannot sleep in a dark room due to her fears, but she wants to challenge herself someday.
D. You can't pour from an empty cup.",A,"# A

A: The most analogous sentence to the given target sentence is:

""Kevin was admired by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him, they discovered that the renowned goal was just a lucky shot.""

In this sentence, ""Kevin"" is the subject, and ""new recruits"" are the ones admiring him. The word ""admired"" is the verb that describes their action. The phrase ""to be the best player in the game"" is the object of their admiration. The sentence then introduces a contrasting element when it says ""But when they met him,"" indicating that something unexpected happened. The phrase ""renowned goal"" refers to a notable achievement, and ""lucky shot"" is the contrasting element that reveals the unexpected outcome."
5,Mary often boasted of her rose garden to be the best garden in the city. But in reality it is nothing but ordinary.,"A. I am absolutely terrified of skydiving, but I think once in my life, I will give it a whirl.

B. Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not right choice as she had a lot of work to do.
C. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.
D. I hate to inform you that your A in chemistry was actually a clerical error.",A,"#1: A

The correct answer is A. The sentence ""Don't let his clothes fool you. He may dress himself in simple clothes without logos, but he is actually a millionaire."" is most similar to the sentence ""The life of royals looks glamorous from afar but it is not as happy and fun as it looks."" in terms of the contrast between appearance and reality. Both sentences describe a situation where the outward appearance of something is different from its actual state or condition. In the first sentence, the person's simple clothes do not reflect their actual wealth, while in the second sentence, the glamorous appearance of royals does not reflect the reality of their lives."
8,"Although Lexi looks like an airhead, she is one of the wisest people I have ever met.","A. If the workers cannot work for 20 hours a week, they can quit.

C. Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.
D. When the site was just discovered and undeveloped, Larry was able to purchase the home for a low price. Now, the price has risen to the point where even Will cannot afford it.",C,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

C. Don’t judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.

This sentence is analogous because it also emphasizes the importance of not judging someone based on their outward appearance, just like the target sentence warns against judging Max based on his edgy fashion sense. It also suggests that appearances can be misleading, which is a key point in the target sentence when Claire discovers Max's kind and sensitive nature despite his unconventional fashion choices."
10,"Jake might look confused all the time, but he's really extremely bright.","A. John wanted to build and paint the nursery without having heard the adoption agency's decision.
B. I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

C. It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.

13,The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job.,"A. Sally owns a pet dog; the dog always wiggles its tails and sits next to Sally's father more than anyone else.
B. Don't be greedy, just take whatever they offer you as if you negotiate too much they might take the offer back.
C. Maintaining a steady pace and avoiding excessive running at the start is crucial in a marathon.
D. The journalist thought the life of the famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not what it looks like.",D,"The target sentence talks about a lawyer who left his profession to pursue an MBA degree, thinking it would lead to better job prospects. However, despite his new qualification, he is still struggling to find a job. The sentence highlights the idea that changing one's profession or pursuing a higher degree does not always guarantee success or a better life.

Option A talks about a dog that prefers to sit next to Sally's father more than anyone else, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B advises against being too greedy and warns that over-negotiation might lead to the loss of an opportunity, which is not analogous to the target sentence.

Option C discusses the importance of maintaining a steady pace during a marathon, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D talks about a journalist who thought the life of a famous actress was extraordinary, only to realize later that it was not as glamorous as it seemed. This option is somewhat related to the target sentence as it talks about someone who had a different perception of something and later realized it was not as good as they thought. However, it does not fully capture the essence of the target sentence, which talks about the consequences of changing one's profession or pursuing a higher degree.

Therefore, the most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:"
14,John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.,"A. I asked Joe to lend me his bicycle, and he sent me this old, rusty one which I had to use as I had no other option.

#3 Jake may appear puzzled all the time, but he's actually incredibly intelligent.

16,"The life of a celebrity looks like they have it all, but in fact they have more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.","A. Kevin was worshipped by the new recruits to be the best player in the game. But when they met him they learned that the famous goal was just a fluke.
B. Lake Erie drains into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River.
C. Often times, in the interest of reaching the destination, we forget to experience the journey.
D. I would rather use my old pan for cooking than buy the new utensil with fancy features.",A,"#1: A

The correct answer is A.

The sentence ""The life of a celebrity looks like they have everything, but in reality they have more problems than anyone can imagine"" is a paradoxical statement. It suggests that the life of a celebrity appears to be perfect and full of luxury and fame, but in reality, it is filled with more problems and difficulties than anyone can imagine. This is similar to the situation described in option A, where Kevin is considered the best player but his goal was just a lucky shot. Despite his reputation as a great player, he is not as skilled as people think he is."
17,She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own when she turned to look at it. But she had no idea that it was more difficult to keep up.,"A. John is rich and everyone is envious of his wealth. But he is also lonely as he has no one to share his life with.

The cause and effect relationship is the same in both sentences, with the subject's physical exertion leading to exhaustion and inability to continue immediately."

The speaker is suggesting that even though it is not extremely cold, it is still better to use a car to avoid the risk of getting sick.

A testament to nature's finest, a sight to clutch.

The rivers, they flow, like veins of the earth,
Carrying life and nourishment, from the birth.
Their currents, like a dance, in a rhythm so pure,
A melody of water, a sight to endure.

The correct answer is:

#A

Explanation:

The correct answer is option A because it is the only option that accurately represents the relationship between the words ""so"" and ""that"" in the target sentence. In the target sentence, ""so"" is used to indicate a strong connection between the idea of Larry being attached to the idea of working for Frank and the idea that no other employer could convince him otherwise. This is a common use of ""so"" in English, which is to indicate a logical consequence or result of a previous statement. Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence because it also uses ""so"" to indicate a logical consequence of a previous statement."

B. Hearing the startup give its business pitch was more informative than any of their marketing and advertising.

The target sentence and the given sentence share a similar structure and meaning. In the target sentence, the speaker suggests that watching the adaptation is a more efficient way to understand the story compared to reading the five massive books it was based on. Similarly, in the given sentence, the speaker implies that hearing the startup's pitch directly from them is more informative than their marketing and advertising efforts. Both sentences highlight the idea that a direct experience or source of information can be more valuable or effective than indirect or secondary means."

C. Sam decided not to engage with Peter in a friendly manner anymore after he made fun of her about her insecurities.
D. The group managed to finish the project just in time and submitted the report two minutes before the deadline.",B,"# A

The correct answer is A. The sentence ""The lawyer left his profession to become an MBA graduate thinking it was better. Guess what? He is still struggling to find a job."" is the most analogous to the given target sentence.

The target sentence compares the usefulness of hearing a startup's business pitch to the company's marketing and advertising efforts, stating that the former is more informative. The sentence implies that the pitch provides valuable insights into the company's business model, strategies, and plans, which are essential for potential investors, partners, or customers.

Option A is the most similar in structure and meaning to the target sentence. It compares the lawyer's decision to leave his profession to pursue an MBA degree with the expectation that it would be better, only to find himself still struggling to find a job. This comparison highlights the idea that sometimes, one's expectations or assumptions about a situation may not align with the actual outcomes or results.

Option B compares the usefulness of a map with instructions, but it does not have the same structure or meaning as the target sentence. Option C and D also do not have the same structure or meaning as the target sentence, as they do not involve a comparison between two different aspects of the same situation."

D. The process of quiting smoking starts with a desire to quit smoking.",C,"The correct answer is: C. As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. If we hadn't missed the plane, we would never have met you.

Explanation: 
The target sentence talks about how a painter had to use red color instead of yellow due to the absence of the latter, and this unconventional choice led to the painting's fame. The most analogous sentence among the options is C, which also talks about an unplanned event leading to a positive outcome. In this case, missing a plane led to a chance encounter with someone, which is a positive outcome. The phrase ""every cloud has a silver lining"" is a common idiom that means every difficult situation has a positive aspect. Therefore, option C is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

D. Although Larry looked forward to meeting his favorite author at the event, he had yet to receive an invite.",B,"#1 A

It suggests that just because someone else is not doing something correctly or properly, it does not mean that you should also follow their example. Instead, it is important to take responsibility for your own actions and make sure that you are doing what is right for you.

Option A is the correct answer because it represents the same message as the given sentence. It emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and setting boundaries, which is the main point of the original sentence."

D. Your friend going to the spa instead of doing her homework doesn't mean you can do it too.",D,"Step 1: Analyze the target sentence
The target sentence is about Sally who spent her weekend relaxing, following her sister's example, but it was not the right choice because she had a lot of work to do.

Step 2: Analyze the options
Option A talks about politicians who lie and how it gets them into trouble. Option B is about David who had to work hard to fix a system. Option C is about Larry who bought a house at a low price and now it's too expensive. Option D is about a friend who goes to the spa instead of doing her homework.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also talks about a situation where something was initially accessible or affordable but later became less so.

The target sentence is about securing the best batch or option, and the options may not be as favorable if we delay. The correct answer, A, suggests starting early to secure the best option, which is similar to the target sentence's advice to go to the farmer's market early to get the best batch."

D. Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.",D,"#A, #B, #C, #D

The answer is: #D

The most analogous sentence to the given sentence is: ""Many people find mathematics difficult to understand, but to me, it is the most fascinating subject."" This sentence is similar in structure and meaning to the given sentence, as it presents a contrast between a common view and the speaker's personal perspective."
125,"She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary.","A. If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.

The most analogous sentence to the given sentence is:

A. If you had come earlier with your computer, it would have been possible to fix the malfunction. But now, you may need to buy a new one.

The sentence ""She thinks he is the most attractive man in the world, even though others perceive him as ordinary."" is a comparison of two different perspectives, one being the speaker's viewpoint and the other being the general perception of others. The speaker believes that the person is attractive, despite the fact that many people see him as ordinary.

In the given options, option A is the most analogous because it also presents a situation where a desired outcome (fixing a malfunction) is dependent on a missed opportunity (not having the necessary tool at the right time). The sentence talks about the possibility of a solution being available if certain conditions were met, but since those conditions were not met, a different outcome is now inevitable (buying a new computer). This is similar to the situation in the target sentence, where the man's attractiveness, according to the speaker, is not perceived as such by others."

D. I don’t really like the colour of your car, but then, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.",D,"#1 A is the correct answer.

The sentence is a statement that describes a situation and provides a reason or explanation for that situation. The statement is not a question, so the answer is A."

D. Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.",B,"# A

A is the correct answer.

The sentence that is most analogous to the given target sentence is: ""Although many people dislike the color combination of orange and green, I believe it to be one of the best."" This sentence follows the same structure as the target sentence by expressing a contrasting opinion to a commonly held viewpoint. It also uses a similar sentence structure and maintains the same theme of personal preference and subjective taste."
128,"Many people fail to understand the beauty of mathematics. But to me, it is the most meaningful subject.","A. The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it.

C. After seeing Tim being disappointed over not making the basketball team, Barry advised him to stray away from his emotions and work hard to try again next year.
D. After working two years for the company she was burned out.",A,"# A

A is the correct answer.

The sentence ""The oldest laptop in the office is Lexi's. But she really enjoys using it."" is the most analogous to the given target sentence.

In the target sentence, the first part of the sentence states that many people do not appreciate the beauty of mathematics, but the speaker finds it to be the most meaningful subject. This is similar to the first part of the analogous sentence, which states that many people might not appreciate the oldest laptop in the office, but the owner, Lexi, enjoys using it.

The second part of the target sentence expresses the speaker's personal perspective on mathematics, stating that it is the most meaningful subject for them. This is analogous to the second part of the analogous sentence, which expresses Lexi's personal enjoyment of using her laptop.

Therefore, option A is the most analogous sentence to the target sentence."

C. Larry was upset even months after breaking up with Samantha. So, Mary, his sister finally told him that there is no point in dwelling over it since Samantha has moved on.

Explanation:

The target sentence talks about Walter's failure and his father's response, which is a metaphorical way of saying that one should not dwell on past failures or disappointments. The sentence suggests that it's futile to cry over spilt milk, which means it's pointless to waste time feeling sorry for something that has already happened and can't be changed.

Option A talks about someone crying and then becoming cheerful, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option B talks about someone preferring to learn from diagrams rather than notes, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence.

Option D talks about someone being distracted by the peculiar grammar and word choice in a book, which is not related to the theme of the target sentence."

Let's analyze each option:

Option A: This sentence talks about lawyers discussing something at a business seminar. It doesn't relate to the target sentence as it doesn't express any emotion or achievement.

Option B: This sentence talks about someone's joy over a task being completed properly. It's similar to the target sentence in the sense that it expresses joy over an accomplishment. However, it's not the most analogous as it's not about a significant milestone like graduation.

Option C: This sentence talks about a daughter causing problems for her mother. It doesn't express any positive emotion or achievement, making it the least analogous to the target sentence.

Option D: This sentence talks about the importance of understanding others before taking a stand. It doesn't express any emotion or achievement, making it less analogous to the target sentence.

D. The way he's obsessing over one doorknob when we're renovating the entire house makes me think that he can't see the larger picture.",D,"#1: A

The correct answer is A.

The sentence ""The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass"" is the most analogous to the target sentence ""The congressman became so involved in the wording of his bill that he did not realize that the bill could never pass.""

The other sentences are not analogous because they do not share the same theme or context as the target sentence. 

Option A is the correct choice because it shares the same theme and context as the target sentence. It talks about a person becoming so involved in a specific task (studying under a guru) that they fail to see the bigger picture (the fact that they are not making progress)."

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is the one that conveys the same idea of focusing on the bigger picture rather than getting fixated on a minor detail. In the target sentence, the speaker is pointing out that the person is overly concerned with a single doorknob while the entire house is being renovated. The correct option, C, talks about missing a bus, but instead of getting angry about it, the speaker suggests moving forward and finding an alternative solution, which is walking. This is similar to the target sentence in that it highlights the importance of not getting too caught up in a minor setback or detail and instead focusing on the bigger picture or overall situation."

C. Frank finally had a good sleep in his childhood bed when he returned to the familiarity of his home country after years of working in faraway lands.
D. Jimmy was reassured after consulting with the professor about what courses to take next semester.",B,"# A

The correct answer is: A. A picture of diseased lungs on the back of cigarette packs is more effective than just the statutory warning message.

Explanation:

The given sentence is about a chef choosing a simpler recipe for a less adventurous customer. The chef is selecting a dish from a list of simpler recipes, indicating that there are more complex ones available. This is similar to the situation in option A, where a picture of diseased lungs is more effective than just a statutory warning message. The picture provides a more impactful and clear message about the harmful effects of smoking, similar to how the simpler recipe is easier to understand and follow for a less adventurous customer.

Option B talks about people trying to deceitfully sell cheap watches as expensive Rolexes in a certain area, which is not related to the original sentence.

Option C is about a person having a good sleep in their childhood bed after returning to their home country, which is not related to the original sentence.

Option D is about a person being reassured after consulting with a professor about their course selection, which is not related to the original sentence."

Explanation:
The target sentence describes a situation where Silvy is not fulfilling her duties as expected, but still receiving benefits. The sentence implies that the manager is dissatisfied with Silvy's behavior and plans to take action against her.

Option A is not analogous because it talks about an individual's stamina being an asset, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option C is not analogous because it talks about Sally's decision to be with Scott despite the circumstances, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option D is not analogous because it talks about a tree falling over and the father creating a painting, which is not related to the target sentence.

Option B, on the other hand, talks about Andy playing hooky from work and now being on thin ice with his boss. This situation is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves an individual not fulfilling their duties as expected and facing consequences from their supervisor."

C. It looks like fun but it is actually a struggle to move to a different country. You should count your blessings.
D. All the people who had the same interests at the conference were socializing together.",A,"The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is:

B. Sally spent the weekend relaxing following her sister's example. But it was not the right choice as she had a lot of work to do.

In this sentence, Sally is avoiding her responsibilities by choosing to relax, much like Hannah in the target sentence is avoiding her responsibilities by pretending to be occupied by personal issues. The use of ""but"" in both sentences also indicates a contrast between two different actions or choices. The letter 'B' is the correct answer."

C. Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.
D. Every cigarette you smoked is a threat to your health.",B,"#1 A

The correct answer is: A.

The sentence ""Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realized he had no work and made him do the chores all week."" is a bit confusing because it contains a typo and some grammatical errors. Here's a corrected version: ""Philip avoided the chores by pretending to be busy until his mother realized he had no work and made him do the chores all week.""

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. She has been talking trash about us all week to everyone. So I don't feel sorry for her when someone spilled all her secrets.

This sentence is not analogous to the original sentence because it talks about someone talking trash about others and not about someone avoiding tasks.

B. Andy played hooky from work for a week saying he was sick, now he is on very thin ice according to his boss.

This sentence is not analogous to the original sentence because it talks about someone skipping work and being in trouble, not about someone avoiding tasks.

C. Philip needed an entire day of focus to finish the project that he switched off all of his devices.

This sentence is not analogous to the original sentence because it talks about someone needing a lot of time and focus to finish a project,"

The target sentence is: ""Garry knows he is underpaid, but he chooses not to focus on it as he is more than happy to have a job.""

The correct answer is: A. How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?

The revised answer is: A. How can you expect to not to fail if you didn't study for the test at all?

The revised answer is the same as the original answer because both sentences convey the same message. The target sentence and the revised answer both express the idea that someone is choosing not to focus on a negative situation (being underpaid) because they are content with a positive aspect (having a job).

C. I would have preferred a house of my own rather than sharing, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

D. I think it’s better to compromise with your neighbour now instead of letting tensions simmer and allowing the problem to snowball.

In the target sentence, the speaker highlights the contrast between the girl's actions and her words. Despite not bragging about her achievements, she still managed to secure the second position in the board exams. This demonstrates that actions speak louder than words.

In option D, the speaker suggests that it's better to resolve issues with neighbors immediately rather than letting them escalate. This contrasts with the idea of bragging about one's achievements, which can sometimes lead to conflicts. The sentence emphasizes the importance of taking action rather than just talking about it, which is similar to the message in the target sentence."

D. All the songs on her album are amazing, but the last one is the one that ruins the vibe.",A,"#1: A

The answer is: A.

Explanation: The sentence ""Garry talked about how easily he managed the work stress. But his constant need of smoking told a different story."" is the most analogous to the given sentence.

The target sentence talks about a person named Garry who talks about how he manages his work stress, but his constant need for smoking tells a different story. This is similar to the sentence ""Peter's parents said they were not good parents at all but they were always ready to spend quality time with their children showing they were really good parents."" where Peter's parents say they are not good parents, but their actions show otherwise.

The other options are not analogous because they do not have the same structure or meaning as the target sentence."

B. Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him.
C. Don't you know he is the president of the United States?!.
D. You can't drive a car with no fuel.",D,"#1: A

The correct answer is A.

The other options are not analogous to the target sentence, ""It's hard to love with a broken heart."" The sentence ""Lets meet him and ask about the robbery"" is about meeting someone and asking about a crime, which is not related to the concept of loving with a broken heart. The sentence ""Lisa knew that Mark borrowed her book without asking, but she doesn't mention this to him"" is about a person named Lisa and her book, which is not related to the topic of loving with a broken heart. The sentence ""Don't you know he is the president of the United States?"" is about a person being the president, which is not related to the topic of loving with a broken heart. The sentence ""You can't drive a car with no fuel"" is about driving a car, which is not related to the topic of loving with a broken heart."
285,A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.,"A. Normally I try to maintain a good work-life balance, but I worked all of last week non stop because I had 5 deadlines and I couldn't miss any of them.
B. Sachin is said to be the best cricketer in the world, but like every other player, he had to retire.
C. John brought out one dish after another onto the dining room table. Soon, all the guests began gathering around.
D. one can't eat from a broken plate.",D,"The target sentence is: ""A broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.""

This sentence is a metaphorical statement that compares a broken cup to its original state of being able to hold coffee. It implies that the cup is no longer functional for its intended purpose due to damage.

Now, let's analyze each option:

A. This sentence is not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about maintaining a work-life balance, which is not related to the concept of a broken cup.

B. This sentence is also not analogous to the target sentence as it talks about Sachin, a cricketer, retiring, which is not related to a broken cup.

C. This sentence is somewhat analogous to the target sentence as it talks about a dish being brought out and people gathering around. However, it does not directly compare the dish to its original state or function.

D. This sentence is the most analogous to the target sentence as it directly compares a broken plate to its original state of being able to hold food. It implies that one cannot eat from a broken plate, just as a broken cup can no longer contain its coffee.

Therefore, the correct answer is [D]."

D. Now that we're friends, we can let bygones be bygones.",C,"# The correct answer is C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

Explanation:
The given target sentence is about the father's ultimatum to the son, where he has to choose between his father's way or leaving the house. The sentence conveys a sense of strictness and no room for compromise.

The options are:

A. Sally has never been to the gym as she is afraid of lifting weights, but lately she's been showing interest and said she will start soon.
This sentence talks about Sally's fear of gym and her recent interest in it. It doesn't convey the same strictness or ultimatum as the target sentence.

B. The game was won when the team broke the tie and scored their third goal.
This sentence talks about a game situation where the team won by scoring the third goal. It doesn't have any context of ultimatum or strictness.

C. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.
This sentence talks about the wife's authority in the kitchen and her ultimatum to the family. It conveys a sense of strictness and no room for compromise, which"

C. You should not be using your pen for gossip and rumors, even though other media reporters are doing so.
D. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.",D,"The correct answer is: D. The wife told the husband that since she is in charge of the kitchen, the family will eat what she makes or go hungry.

The most analogous sentence to the target sentence is the one that conveys a similar message or tone, which is the sense of authority and the consequences of not complying with a rule or decision. In the target sentence, the management is making it clear that the employees must agree with the new policies or face the consequence of being let go. Similarly, in option D, the wife is asserting her authority in the kitchen and making it clear that if the family does not eat what she prepares, they will go hungry. This option is the most analogous because it also involves a person in a position of authority making a decision and setting consequences for non-compliance."

The management made it clear that the employees had to be on board with the new policies or they would be let go.

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also involves a person or group (management) in a position of authority making a demand or ultimatum. In this case, the employees are expected to comply with the new policies or face consequences (being let go). The tone is firm and assertive, similar to the wife's tone in the target sentence. The other options do not share this similarity."

This sentence is analogous to the target sentence because it also advises caution and patience in decision-making. Just as the target sentence warns against selling all shares when the market is low, this sentence suggests not taking on too much work when it won't affect performance reviews.

C. Andy opened the window blinds to see the sun rising. The dark room was brighly lit in a few hours.
D. While a bed would be nice, I'm fine with sleeping on the sofa in the living room for now.",A,"# A

A is the correct answer.

The sentence ""People in the village say that the house is haunted by the ghost of the lady that lived here many years back. So, my father decides to wait to buy it so he can take more opinions from different people."" is a narrative about a house that is rumored to be haunted by a ghost. The narrator's father decides to delay purchasing the house to seek more opinions from others before making a decision. 

Option A is the most analogous choice because it also involves a situation where taking more time to gather more information is beneficial. In this case, the narrator's father is taking a cautious approach by waiting to make a decision about purchasing the house until he has gathered more information and opinions from others. This is similar to the situation in option A, where taking more work in the next quarter is not necessary because it will not affect the current appraisals.
